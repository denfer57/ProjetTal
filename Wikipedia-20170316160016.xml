'''''G.I. Joe: Ninja Battles''''' is a film that was released on DVD in late 2004, as part of the Ninja Battles set of [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]] figures. In it, the history of the [[Arashikage]] Clan, as well as the history of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow's rivalry, are examined through a series of trials. Scenes from both ''[[G.I. Joe: Spy Troops]]'' and ''[[G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom]]'' are used, with a brief period of new animation at the end of the movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;yojoeDVD&quot;&gt;[http://www.yojoe.com/television/ninjabattles/ G.I. Joe: Ninja Battles] at YOJOE.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Narrated by the [[Iron Master]], the story takes place in the Iron Master's forge. [[Tiger Claw (G.I. Joe)|Tiger Claw]] has just earned his name, and so Iron Master explains how the war between the Arashikage Clan and the Red Ninjas began, by telling the origin of the rivalry between [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]] and [[Storm Shadow (G.I. Joe)|Storm Shadow]]. The story is told in flashbacks, to the first time that Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow faced off against each other, when the [[Hard Master]] put them through four trials. The trials end with Storm Shadow joining Cobra, blaming Snake Eyes for the demise of his family.

[[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]], who had been standing in the shadows with Snake Eyes during the Iron Master's story, steps forward to tell Tiger Claw that someday Storm Shadow will learn the truth about his family, and be welcomed back into the Arashikage Clan. Storm Shadow then appears to challenge Snake Eyes and Tiger Claw, who reveal that [[Kamakura (G.I. Joe)|Kamakura]] and [[Jinx (G.I. Joe)|Jinx]] are there to back them up. Storm Shadow then reveals allies of his own, in the form of [[Slash (G.I. Joe)|Slash]], [[Slice (G.I. Joe)|Slice]], and [[Shadow Strike]]. The ninjas all battle in Iron Master's forge, until the villains finally escape. Duke then offers Tiger Claw membership in the G.I. Joe Team.

==The four trials==

===Mizu===
&quot;Mizu&quot; - The Trial of Water: Water is considered to be &quot;shifting, formless, taking the shape of whatever confines it&quot;. The trial is designed to test a ninja's understanding and mastery of strategy. Hard Master gives each ninja a bowl of water, and each must get the other's bowl without taking it from the other's hand. Tiger Claw realizes that the strategy is cooperation, so that both may complete the task, by giving their bowl to the other. Instead, Storm Shadow chose to take the water bowl from Snake Eyes by tripping him, which was considered an act of weakness by the Hard Master.

===Tsuchi===
&quot;Tsuchi&quot; - The Trial of Earth: Earth is considered to be &quot;solid and supportive, resisting change, but giving strength&quot;. The trial is designed to test a ninja's use and understanding of force alone. Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow stand atop wooden poles, and Snake Eyes is the first to realize &quot;to defeat your enemy in battle, first defeat the battleground&quot;. He causes Storm Shadow to fall first, who turns in anger to consult the ninja named Shadow Strike, not knowing that Shadow Strike has been watching the trials as a Cobra spy.

===Kaze===
&quot;Kaze&quot; - The Trial of Wind: Wind is considered to be &quot;forceful or subtle, striking from all directions, but always unseen&quot;. The trial is designed to test a ninja's understanding and mastery of bladed weapons. Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow face each other with swords on a rope bridge. At one point, a rope is cut and Storm Shadow loses his sword, as he almost falls over the edge. Snake Eyes reaches to help him up, but Storm Shadow throws a [[shuriken]] at him, which causes Snake Eyes to fall off the bridge. Storm Shadow wins, but the Hard Master shows his disapproval by breaking Storm Shadow's sword, which further angers Storm Shadow. In this continuity, it is revealed that Hard Master is considered to be Storm Shadow's father.

===Hi===
&quot;Hi&quot; - The Trial of Fire: Fire is considered to be &quot;a force of creation when used wisely, but a force of destruction when unleashed&quot;. The trial is designed to test a ninja's senses, and demonstrate understanding and mastery of fire in all its forms. For this trial, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow descend to a dungeon filled with mirrors. They are each given a laser pistol to use as a tool, but are expected to use their senses to determine what is real and what is illusion. While they are fighting, Shadow Strike uses this opportunity to signal [[Cobra Commander]], who also arrives at the dungeon. Not knowing that others are there, Hard Master is shot by Cobra Commander and killed. Storm Shadow believes that it is Snake Eyes who shot the Hard Master, and so he leaves to join Cobra, convinced that Snake Eyes has betrayed the Arashikage Clan.

'''''G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor''''' is the title of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[video game]] developed by [[KID]] and published by [[Capcom]] in the United States in 1992. Previously, a ''[[G.I. Joe (NES video game)|G.I. Joe]]'' video game was released for the NES by [[Taxan]] in 1991.

==Storyline==
Having survived the last time he fought the G.I. Joe Team, [[Cobra Commander]] has raised the ancient island of [[Atlantis]] from the ocean depths and is using it as a base. With a nearly indestructible army and powerful space weapons, the power-crazed Cobra is plotting to use the long lost powers of the Atlanteans in their bid to rule the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameFAQs&quot;/&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game's format is similar to that of Capcom's ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]'' series, with an overhead map of the various stages. In order to progress, the player must navigate the map and clear each sub-stage leading up to one of several Cobra bases. Once in a base, the player must fight through hostile Cobra forces and also complete a secondary mission (such as rescuing hostages, setting bombs, or locating a key item). Each base stage concludes with a battle against a Cobra leader ([[Overkill (G.I. Joe)|Overkill]], [[Cesspool (G.I. Joe)|Cesspool]], [[Firefly (G.I. Joe)|Firefly]], [[Major Bludd]], [[Destro]], and Cobra Commander).

There are several playable characters in the game: [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|General Hawk]], [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]], [[Wet Suit (G.I. Joe)|Wet Suit]], [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]], [[Storm Shadow (G.I. Joe)|Storm Shadow]], and [[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yojoe&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.yojoe.com/archive/games/atlantis.shtml| title = G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor for the NES| last = Roberts| first = Matt| publisher = YoJoe.com| accessdate = 2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the game, the player can only use Hawk, and must unlock the other characters one by one by completing other stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobygames&quot;&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/gi-joe-the-atlantis-factor- G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor] at [[MobyGames]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once players have discovered a character, they can &quot;decide&quot; which characters will come with them, and alternate between them during gameplay by pressing the “pause” button and accessing the pause menu. Each character has their own agility, stamina and strength rating, although they are not shown unlike the [[G.I. Joe (video game)|previous game]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allgame&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14984| title = G.I.

In addition to the playable characters, [[Gung-Ho (G.I. Joe)|Gung-Ho]], [[Spirit (G.I. Joe)|Spirit]], and [[Big Bear (G.I. Joe)|Big Bear]] can be summoned to support the player by refilling life or weapon ammunition, though they must first be rescued by completing certain sub-stages. [[Stalker (G.I. Joe)|Stalker]] also appears but only in cutscenes, as he coordinates the mission from the G.I. Joe base.&lt;ref name=&quot;yojoe&quot;/&gt;

'''''G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra''''' is the title of a [[video game]] adaption of the [[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra|film of the same name]]. The game takes place after the film. The 360 and [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] versions are based on the same code, while the DS is an entirely different game unto itself, and the [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version are also based on relatively similar code.

A significant feature has [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] reprising his role of Cobra Commander while the rest of the characters are done by voice actors.

Agent Helix appears as a playable character in the video game, voiced by [[Nancy Truman]]. She was designed by Mayan Escalante, a character artist at [[Double Helix Games]], as an un-lockable character in the video game. She then became an action figure in the 2009 edition of the toyline.

Agent Helix is a covert operations officer with advanced martial arts training and expert marksmanship. Her favorite weapons are dual [[10mm Auto]] pistols. An Olympic-class gymnast, her distinctive &quot;Whirlwind attack&quot; is an overpowering combination of kicks and firepower.

==Reception==
{{Video game reviews
|Play=22%&lt;ref&gt;Play magazine review, issue 183, [[Imagine Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The game received mixed to negative scores from a lot of websites. It achieved a [[Metacritic]] average of 42% on the Xbox 360, and 43% on the PS3.

[[IGN]] gave the main console version a 5.8 / 10,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/101/1010452p1.html |title=IGN Xbox 360 Review |publisher=Xbox360.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing the game's poor graphics and gameplay in general. IGN also gave the DS version a more positive 7.1 / 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/101/1010769p1.html |title=IGN DS Review |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GamesMaster magazine in the UK was slightly more upbeat about the Xbox 360 incarnation, calling it &quot;an enjoyable if throwaway action game that weighs in at a not so throwaway price.&quot;

IT Reviews complained that the game consisted of &quot;repetitive bouts of blasting the same enemies, through the same terrain,&quot; and added &quot;much of the time it feels as though you're only half playing the game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itreviews.co.uk/games/g614.htm |title=IT Reviews |publisher=IT Reviews |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611112335/http://www.itreviews.co.uk/games/g614.htm |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

G4TV's X-Play gave the game a 1/5, saying, &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is the new gold standard for lazy and uninspired cash-in licensed games. It could perhaps be argued that the developers didn’t have much to work with given the source material, but that doesn’t help the unfortunate consumer who ends up stuck with this Junkyard Dog of a game in his collection.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keil |first=Matt |url=http://g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/57082/gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra/review/ |title=G4TV Review |publisher=G4tv.com |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaming Nexus commented that &quot;There's no reason to buy G.I. Joe as long as there is at least one other game on the store shelf.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/GI-Joe/Page2/Item2362.aspx |title=G.I.

'''''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero''''' is a 1991 [[Shoot 'em up#Run and gun|run and gun]] [[video game|game]] published by [[Taxan]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] based on the [[action figure|toyline]] of the [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero|same name]]. The game was produced by [[Ken Lobb]] and developed by the same Japanese team that later formed [[KID]]. A sequel developed by the same team, titled ''[[G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor]]'', was released the following year, but was published by Capcom after Taxan went out of business.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Gijoenesscreen.jpg|thumb|left|Snake Eyes battles Destro's Dominator from ''G.I. Joe'' for NES]]
The player takes control of a team of three G.I. Joe characters, each with his own specialty. The goal of the game is to navigate through six stages on a mission to finally bring down [[Cobra Command|Cobra]]. The initial character roster consists of [[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]], [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]], [[Blizzard (G.I. Joe)|Blizzard]], [[Captain Grid-Iron]], and [[Rock 'n Roll (G.I. Joe)|Rock 'n Roll]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yojoe&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.yojoe.com/archive/games/joenes.shtml| title = G.I. Joe for the NES| last = Roberts| first = Matt| publisher = YoJoe.com| accessdate = 2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth character, [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]], gives orders to the team between missions, and becomes available as a playable character for the final stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;yojoe&quot;/&gt; The player's first character is automatically assigned depending on the stage, while the second and third characters are freely chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;mania&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/toy-maniac-retro-review-gi-joe-real-american-hero-nes_article_116894.html |title=game review |publisher=Mania.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player collects [[power-up]]s in the game that increases an individual character's abilities. Gun icons increases firepower, [[K-rations]] recovers energy, and [[Chevron (insignia)|Chevron]] icons increases the current character's maximum stamina. Bullet icons refills the player's collective ammunition and [[bulletproof vest]] icons that grant temporary invincibility are also available at designated locations on each area. Icons flashing in red are more valuable than ordinary icons. All upgrades garnered during the course of the game are permanent, provided of course the character survives the mission.

Certain areas have empty enemy vehicles that the main character can operate. The three different vehicles available are the Buzz Boar, the Pogo, and the Battle Copter. The player can still plant bombs while riding these vehicles.

Each stage is broken up into three different segments: In the first segment, the player's team would fight their way into one of Cobra's bases. After penetrating the base, the player's team must plant a certain amount of bombs inside the base before time runs out. Afterward, the player must fight against the base's commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobygames&quot;&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/gi-joe-a-real-american-hero_ G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero] at [[MobyGames]]&lt;/ref&gt; The enemy bosses include a [[Range-Viper]], [[Metal-Head]], [[Overlord (G.I. Joe)|Overlord]], [[Voltar (G.I. Joe)|Voltar]], [[Destro]] and [[Cobra Commander]] himself. A password is given at the end of each stage.

==Plot summary==
The six missions that the G.I. Joe team members must progress through each take place in a different part of the world: the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]], [[Antarctica]], [[New York City]], the [[Black Hills]], and the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yojoe&quot;/&gt; The game's final mission takes place in Cobra Headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;yojoe&quot;/&gt;

==Playable characters==
There are five initial characters in the game (with a sixth character that becomes available for the final stage), each with his strength to bring to the game. The player can choose a team of three for each area. During gameplay, the player can switch between characters after pausing the game. The characters’ skills are agility, stamina, strength and firepower.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameFaqs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Cedric Cooks/Oda | year=2002 | title=G.I. Joe: FAQ/Walkthrough | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/file/587291/17289| work= | accessdate=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]]''' – The most balanced, possessing the mid-level skills and powers of his comrades. He leads the team in Amazon mission.
* '''[[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]]''' – Can jump higher and punch/throw faster than his teammates. He is also the only one who does not use up any ammunition, using white fireballs instead (described in game as a sort of Jujitsu). While being able to conserve vital ammunition, Snake Eyes' weapon is weak. He leads the team in New York's sewer mission.
* '''[[Captain Grid-Iron|Capt. Grid-Iron]]''' – Has the greatest fist power and is average in other departments. He is very similar to Duke, but with a shorter jump and a smaller spread weapon (described as grenade launcher). He leads the team in Black Hill Mission.
* '''[[Rock 'n Roll (G.I. Joe)|Rock ‘n Roll]]''' – He has the strongest firepower (machine gun) and the widest range of all but all his other ratings below average. He leads the team in the desert mission.
* '''[[Blizzard (G.I. Joe)|Blizzard]]''' - He is sub-par in most skills except stamina. Blizzard may come in handy during the Antarctic world, but otherwise does not stand out in any specific areas, though his (grenade) throwing speed is almost as fast as Snake Eyes. His special ability is that he can shoot through solid walls. He is in charge on the Antarctica missile base mission
* '''[[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|General Hawk]]''' – His appearance is based on the 1991 edition of his action figure. He is the only character who can fly and a requirement when facing Cobra Commander. He only becomes available for use in the final stage. In the course of the game, he was kidnapped by Destro and Rock 'n Roll led a team of operatives to rescue him from the desert.

'''G.I. Joe''' is a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[rail shooter]] video game produced by [[Konami]] and released in 1992 exclusively for [[video arcade]]s. It is based on the cartoon series ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1989 TV series)|G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'' and stars four characters from the show: [[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]], [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]], [[Scarlett (G.I. Joe)|Scarlett]], and [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]].

==Gameplay==
The game is a third-person rail shooting game, in which each player chooses one of four [[G.I. Joe Team|G.I. Joe]] operatives: Duke, Snake Eyes, Scarlett, or Roadblock. Up to four people can play the game at once. Each character either stands or automatically runs forward in a 3D perspective, and their player can use the [[joystick]] to move them left or right as well as raise or lower an aiming [[crosshair]]: this allows for the latter's movement through most of the screen. Each character is armed with a gun that has unlimited ammunition as well as a missile launcher, which comes with 3 to 5 missiles and can hold up to nine.

Players use these weapons via a standard shoot button, and a missile launch button that allows for larger-scale destruction at the cost of one charge. [[Power-up]]s can be acquired that allow the player rapid fire by holding down the shoot button, add another missile to their supply, or restore their character's [[health (gaming)|life energy]].

The object of the game is to find [[Cobra Command|Cobra]]'s hidden stronghold and stop [[Cobra Commander]]'s latest campaign to take over the world. There are three missions in the game, each composed of several areas, including a chemical plant, an air base, a weapon plant, a jungle, a cavern base, and a battleship. Enemies include [[Viper (G.I. Joe)|Viper]] soldiers and various Cobra vehicles such as [[F.A.N.G.|FANG II]], HISS II, Razorback and Hurricane. The bosses consist of [[Tomax and Xamot]], [[Metal-Head]], [[Baroness (G.I. Joe)|The Baroness]], [[Major Bludd]] and [[Destro]], with the final battle taking place between the G.I. Joe team and Cobra Commander.

==Reception==
''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' gave the arcade game a positive review in its July 1992 issue, scoring it 346 out of 400.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG&quot;&gt;http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/230/610/g.i._joe_review.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also gave the arcade game a positive review in its October 1992 issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Gaming Monthly'', issue 39 (October 1992), page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GLaDOS''' ('''G'''enetic '''L'''ifeform '''a'''nd [[DOS|'''D'''isk '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/03/big-boss-of-the-day-portals-glados|title=Big Boss of the Day: ''Portal's'' GLaDOS|author=Jesse Schedeen|publisher=IGN|date=2 February 2010|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[computer|computer system]] appearing in the video games ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', ''[[Portal 2]]'', ''[[The Lab (video game)|The Lab]]'' and ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''. The character was created by [[Erik Wolpaw]] and [[Kim Swift]] and voiced by [[Ellen McLain]].  GLaDOS is responsible for testing and maintenance in the [[Aperture Science]] research facility in all titles. While GLaDOS initially appears in the first game to simply be a voice that guides the player, her words and actions become increasingly malicious as she makes her intentions clear. The second game, as well as the Valve created comic ''Lab Rat'', reveals that she was mistreated by the scientists &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinkwithportals.com/comic/#14&lt;/ref&gt; and used a [[neurotoxin]] to kill the scientists in the laboratory before the events of ''Portal''. She is ostensibly destroyed at the end of the first game but returns in the sequel, in which she is comically supplanted and temporarily stuck on a potato battery.

The inspiration for the character's creation extends from Wolpaw's use of a [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] program while writing lines for the video game ''[[Psychonauts]]''. Other [[video game developer|game developers]] working on ''Psychonauts'' found the lines funnier as a result of the synthesized voice. GLaDOS was originally intended to be present solely in the first area of ''Portal''; she was well received by other designers and her role was expanded as a result. [[Video game development#Tester|Play testers]] were motivated to complete tests in the game due to her guidance. While the game was initially designed with other characters, they were later removed, leaving GLaDOS as the only character players encounter. The physical appearance of GLaDOS went through several designs, one of which featured a large disk below her. McLain imitated dialog read aloud by a speech synthesizer with her own voice, which was then processed to sound more robotic, and performed songs in character during the closing credits of both entries in the series. &quot;[[Still Alive]]&quot; became hugely successful, notably appearing in the ''[[Rock Band]]'' game series, and has been a popular song for [[YouTube]] users to [[cover version|cover]].

GLaDOS has been well received by critics and gamers, some of whom called her narcissistic, [[Passive–aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive]], sinister, and witty. She is considered one of the greatest video game characters, particularly among those created between 2000 and 2009. Universally praised for her contributions to the caliber of ''Portal''{{'}}s narrative, GLaDOS received multiple awards for being the best new game character in 2007 from [[GameSpy]], ''[[GamePro]]'', and ''[[X-Play]]''. A number of publications listed her as one of the all-time greatest video game villains, including [[IGN]] and ''[[Game Informer]]'', both of which ranked her first. She has been the subject of significant critical analysis from both journalists and game developers, who have compared her to other villainous computer systems in fiction, including [[HAL 9000]] from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and [[SHODAN]] from ''[[System Shock]]''.

==Description==

|format=[[Ogg]]}}

For much of ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', GLaDOS serves solely as the narrator, guiding players through the test chambers. Her voice is robotic, but distinctly female. Over time, players learn that she is in fact leading the player-character [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]] to her death.  As Chell escapes her control, GLaDOS's announcements get increasingly personal and farcical.  Her personality has been described as passive-aggressive, witty, [[Narcissism|narcissistic]], and sinister. She has a number of system personality cores installed into her, partly in order to prevent her from killing anyone. At the climax of the game, Chell enters GLaDOS' chambers, where it is revealed that she's actually a complex [[artificial intelligence]] system composed of robotic parts hanging from a larger device. Once the player removes the first personality core, the morality core, GLaDOS' voice becomes less robotic and more sensual. Originally, GLaDOS was designed as an artificial intelligence and research assistant meant to aid Aperture Science in competing with the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] on the creation of portal technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marie|first=Meagan|title=Aperture Science: A History|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/24/aperture-science_3a00_-a-history.aspx|publisher=Game Informer|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later proposed uses for GLaDOS included implementation as a fuel line ice inhibitor and [[disk operating system]]. GLaDOS is installed to serve as the Enrichment Center's central control computer, mounted in a large, sealed chamber alongside several control consoles and an incinerator, the latter being her eventual demise.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamber19&quot;&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal |developer=Valve Corporation |date=October 10, 2007 |level=Test Chamber 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]], a personality core previously attached to GLaDOS at a nondescript time, is introduced in ''Portal 2''. He was designed with the purpose of giving her bad ideas and inhibiting her personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;p2chapter6&quot;&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal 2 |developer=Valve Corporation |date=April 19, 2011 |level=Chapter 6: The Fall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Wheatley, it's understood by the player that while GLaDOS is attached to the Aperture Science facility, she is driven to test due to a [[euphoria|euphoric sensation]] induced by its completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;p2chapter8&quot;&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal 2 |developer=Valve Corporation |date=April 19, 2011 |level=Chapter 8: The Itch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being disconnected from the Aperture Science facility, GLaDOS treats Chell with more civility. The player then learns that GLaDOS' personality was inherited from that of Caroline, the personal assistant of Aperture Science CEO [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] and is much warmer to Chell when under Caroline's influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;p2chapter7&quot;&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal 2 |developer=Valve Corporation |date=April 19, 2011 |level=Chapter 7: The Reunion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===''Portal''===
In ''Portal'', GLaDOS is Chell's only link with the situation she is placed in; at the game's start, she introduces Chell to the game's Enrichment Center and the physics of the portal gun. In later stages of the center, GLaDOS admits to having lied to Chell about her progress, as part of a supposed &quot;test protocol&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal |developer=Valve Corporation |level=Test Chamber 05, end. |quote='''GLaDOS''': As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication. Good job. As part of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth in three, two, (static).}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLaDOS slowly becomes more sinister, and Chell's trust in GLaDOS is tested when the AI directs Chell into a testing area populated with live-fire turrets, a course designed for military androids. The AI claims that the regular test chamber is unavailable due to &quot;mandatory scheduled maintenance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal |developer=Valve Corporation |level=Test Chamber 16 |quote='''GLaDOS''': Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable. It has been replaced with a live-fire course designed for military androids.}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLaDOS uses the lure of cake and grief counseling to encourage Chell to continue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal |developer=Valve Corporation |level=Test Chamber 15 |quote='''GLaDOS''': The Enrichment Center is committed to the well-being of all participants. Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at the final testing area, as Chell prepares to receive the supposed cake, GLaDOS attempts to incinerate Chell in a fire pit. Once Chell escapes, GLaDOS attempts to reconcile with Chell, claiming the pit was a final test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal |developer=Valve Corporation |level=Test Chamber 19, end. |quote='''GLaDOS''': We are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you. We are very, very happy for your success.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chell then travels through the bowels of the Enrichment Center, battling natural hazards and further turrets until she reaches GLaDOS's chamber, where the final encounter occurs. In this encounter Chell dislodges &quot;personality cores&quot; (each also voiced by McLain, with the exception of the final core, which is voiced in a guttural fashion by [[Mike Patton]]) and incinerates them. During the battle, it is revealed that before the events of ''Portal'', GLaDOS released a [[neurotoxin]] into the Enrichment Center (revealed to occur on [[Take Your Daughter to Work Day]] in the sequel), which resulted in the surviving scientists installing a morality core to prevent further incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal |developer=Valve Corporation |level=&quot;Test Chamber 19&quot; - Escape; GLaDOS' chamber |quote='''GLaDOS''': It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the cores are incinerated, the room is sucked into a vortex leading to the surface and GLaDOS is destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamber19&quot; /&gt; Originally the game ended with a fade to black leaving Chell on the surface. This ending was however replaced in a later patch to the game to a new one (to set up for ''Portal 2'') in which an unconscious Chell is dragged away by the party escort robot (a character referenced earlier in the game).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal |developer=Valve Corporation |level=Test Chamber 19, end |quote='''GLaDOS''': Place the device on the ground, then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides. A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party. [...] Assume the party escort submission position or you will miss the party.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal |developer=Valve Corporation |scene=Ending |platform=PC/Mac |quote=Thank you for assuming the party escort submission position.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final scene shows a room filled with more personality cores that begin to light up and a robotic hand puts out a candle on a cake.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamber19&quot; /&gt;

===''Portal 2''===
In ''Portal 2'', GLaDOS initially resumes her role as test monitor in a now-ruined facility after [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]] inadvertently reactivates her.

GLaDOS rescues Chell, and shows relief for her safety. However, GLaDOS is able to discover where Caroline is in her brain, and immediately deletes her, reverting to her old self. Nevertheless, she decides that it is in her best interest to let Chell go, as GLaDOS learned the easiest solution is usually the best one, and felt that killing Chell was &quot;too hard&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p2chapter9&quot;&gt;{{cite video game |title=Portal 2 |developer=Valve Corporation |date=April 19, 2011 |level=Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Defense Grid''===
{{unreferenced-section|date=July 2016}}
GLaDOS also appears in the ''[[Defense Grid]]'' expansion, ''You Monster,'' where she tests the player's ability to defend against the onslaught of aliens. She also engages in witty banter with your ally, General Fletcher, and eventually takes over as the AI manager of your towers.

==Development history==
[[File:GLaDOS concept art.jpg|thumb|right|GLaDOS went through several redesigns before artists settled on the final anthropomorphic shape. Early concepts featured a floating brain and a spider-like appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;primaguide&quot;/&gt;]]

Before development of GLaDOS had begun, [[Erik Wolpaw]] was writing the script for the video game ''[[Psychonauts]]'', where he went around the office, finding people to provide voices to the words until they could add the final voices to the game. Once he ran out of people, however, he began using a text-to-speech program. According to Wolpaw, people found the lines funnier than they were worth. He commented that &quot;no amount of writing is funnier than this text-to-speech thing reading it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;valve creative process&quot;/&gt; He became bitter about that, stating that he would leverage this and use it to his advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;valve creative process&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Graft |first=Kris |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4151/valves_writers_and_the_creative_.php?page=1 |title=Valve's Writers And The Creative Process |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of GLaDOS began with a discussion between the Valve team and Wolpaw on the narrative constraints they had to deal with.&lt;ref name=&quot;valve creative process&quot;/&gt; When they were designing the game, they found that they did not have enough time or staffing to use human characters, due to the amount of animation work and scene choreography involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;valve creative process&quot;/&gt;

A week later, to alleviate this problem, Wolpaw returned with sample dialogue made with a text-to-speech program, which was intended to be used as a series of messages relayed to the player in the relaxation vault, the first area of the game. The team liked the voice, describing it as &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;sinister&quot;, so Wolpaw decided to add this voice to other test chambers, all the while trying to think of story elements. The developers noticed that play testers were more motivated by the voice because they became attached to it. As a result, the team decided to make GLaDOS the narrative voice of ''Portal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;erik&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Exclusive: Inside The Making Of Portal |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16885 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While designing GLaDOS, one of the rules that the writers had was that they would not make her seem like a computer, for example having her say, &quot;Oh my nuts and bolts.&quot; While GLaDOS is physically a computer and speaks with a computerized voice, they intended her to speak to the player-character like a regular person.&lt;ref name=&quot;valve creative process&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' was the inspiration for one design of GLaDOS, where GLaDOS' physical appearance was similar to the [[Rome|Roman]] [[goddess]] [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]', but upside down.&lt;ref name=&quot;primaguide&quot;/&gt;]]

GLaDOS' physical appearance went through several iterations when Valve had [[Jason Brashill]] help drive the visual creation of GLaDOS. Early designs used for her included a floating brain, a spider-like appearance, and an upside-down version of [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' with the four personality cores around her body.&lt;ref name=&quot;primaguide&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Half-Life 2: The Orange Box: Prima Official Game Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXO7CiGvAoIC |last1=Hodgson |first1=David S.

This was done to convey both a sense of raw mechanical power and femininity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pcom&quot;&gt;''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' commentary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Anyone feel like grabbing the quote from the commentary?--&gt; A large disk with the four personality cores hanging from it was added to her design, when she was still just a sphere standing above it. However, the team found it to be too small, giving her a body and putting it below the disk.&lt;ref name=&quot;primaguide&quot;/&gt; Another early design was when GLaDOS was only a cube, which was used for the removed laser battle mentioned below.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotaku_devs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=McWhertor |first=Michael |url=http://kotaku.com/359961/portal-devs-reveal-the-glados-that-never-was-inspiration-behind-weighted-companion-cube |title=Portal Devs Reveal The GLaDOS That Never Was, Inspiration Behind Weighted Companion Cube |publisher=Kotaku |date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large chamber that the player-character encounters was the result of the team wanting to build a space that brought a great deal of attention to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;primaguide&quot;/&gt;

GLaDOS was written with the intent of making her more understandable and empathetic to players, making her villainy more tragic. Kim Swift, team leader of ''Portal'', described her growth in the game as her becoming more and more human. The two-hour total playtime for ''Portal'' allowed the writers enough time to let players get to know GLaDOS.&lt;ref name=&quot;erikkim&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Still Alive: Kim Swift And Erik Wolpaw Talk Portal |last=Sheffield |first=Brandon |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3585/still_alive_kim_swift_and_erik_.php |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpaw commented that while GLaDOS did yell and fire rockets at the player, she fulfilled his desire for a villain who has not been &quot;done to death&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rps&quot;/&gt; He described her as both supportive and funny, while also sad and scared. One of his intentions was for players to believe that they are &quot;putting her through the wringer emotionally&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rps&quot;/&gt; The game was designed to have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Wolpaw stated that with each new part, GLaDOS' personality changed. She begins as a supportive, yet also increasingly sinister character, where she delivers exposition about the general Aperture mindset. However, once the player-character escapes, she begins to speak in first-person singular rather than first-person plural. She shows desperation due to her lack of control at this point, adding that more emotion begins to creep through her voice. After destroying the morality core, she becomes unhinged, featuring an almost human voice. This voice, described as sultry by Wolpaw, was originally to be used for turrets, but it did not work out. Because they liked it so much, they chose to use it for GLaDOS.&lt;ref name=&quot;rps&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Walker |first=John |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/10/31/rps-interview-valves-erik-wolpaw/ |title=RPS Interview: Valve’s Erik Wolpaw |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |date=2007-10-31 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve described GLaDOS' actions in ''Portal 2'' as attempting to build a relationship with the player-character, and the only way to accomplish this is by testing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hatfield |first=Daemon |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/109/1098375p1.html |title=E3 2010: Portal 2 Preview |publisher=IGN |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice design===
[[File:Ellen McLain signing Atlas at Kitacon 2012.jpg|upright|thumb|right|GLaDOS is voiced by actress [[Ellen McLain]].]]
In creating the voice for GLaDOS, voice actress [[Ellen McLain]] attempted to sound like a computer. This was accomplished by her emulating a computer-generated voice that the Valve team played for her and her adding emotion to lines when appropriate.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclain&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=GLaDOS Speaks |last=Hatfield |first=Daemon |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/831/831900p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While designing her voice, Swift commented that it was difficult to write some of the lines for GLaDOS, describing McLain as &quot;super likable&quot;, and that they should write for that.&lt;ref name=&quot;erikkim&quot;/&gt; She also performed the song &quot;[[Still Alive]]&quot;, which features GLaDOS singing to the effect that she is still alive by the end of ''Portal''. This song was written by [[Jonathan Coulton]], who was approached by the team and asked if he would want to write a song for them. He later decided that it would be a good idea to do a song featuring one of the voices from the game that would tie up the story at the end.&lt;ref name=&quot;jonathanblog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Coulton |first=Jonathan |title=Portal: The Skinny |url=http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2007/10/15/portal-the-skinny/ |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift stated that the team wanted the players to leave the game happy, leading to them implementing the song in the first place. Wolpaw and the other writers wrote down a list of things that would make people happy, which resulted in &quot;Still Alive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;success&quot;/&gt; In discussing the difficulties in singing the song as GLaDOS, McLain listed one of the difficulties as breathing, because computers do not need to breathe. As a result, she had to sing the phrases in one breath, while attempting to keep a clean, even tone.&lt;ref name=&quot;thegamingliberty.com interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=Denis |title=An interview with Ellen McLain and John Patrick Lowrie |url=http://thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2010/07/29/an-interview-with-ellen-mclain-and-john-patrick-lowrie/ |accessdate=2011-05-11 |date=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift commented in an interview that one of the focuses of developing the game was for players to hear GLaDOS and hear her song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Student Union |url=http://www.develop-online.net/features/152/Student-Union |publisher=Develop Online |accessdate=2009-08-24 |date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLaDOS continues to be voiced by McLain in ''Portal 2'', who worked with Valve every two weeks to record the majority of the dialogue for the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.com.au interview&quot;/&gt; The frequency of her voice sessions allowed Valve to experiment with GLaDOS's lines and how they came out within the final game.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.com.au interview&quot; /&gt; After finding that &quot;Still Alive&quot; was a large part of ''Portal's'' success, Valve included more music in ''Portal 2'', including further involvement from Coulton.&lt;ref name=&quot;gi reveal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Portal 2|first=Meagan|last=VanBurkleo|date=April 2010|pages=50–62|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulton wrote a new song for the game's ending credits, &quot;Want You Gone&quot;, which is written from GLaDOS's viewpoint of wanting to rid herself of Chell.

===Final battle===
In designing the final 'encounter' with GLaDOS in ''Portal'', one of the important aspects to it was giving the players a predisposition to the Weighted Companion Cube, an object that GLaDOS gives to the player-character and tells her to protect. This was accomplished by forcing the player to incinerate it, therein providing a tutorial for how to defeat the boss and a revenge angle. GLaDOS was originally designed to be a devious boss, citing one form where she would use a series of lasers, like those seen in ''[[James Bond]]'' films. However, it was determined that this [[twitch gameplay]] distracted players from GLaDOS, and was too different from the game's puzzle-solving gameplay. Additionally, it was difficult for players to detect when they were hit, so the developers switched the gameplay to feature rockets. This incarnation of the final boss was dubbed &quot;Portal Kombat&quot;, which Swift describes as a &quot;high intensity rocket battle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;success&quot;/&gt; However, Wolpaw disliked it because no one was paying attention to what GLaDOS was saying. While it went over well with hardcore shooter fans, the people who liked the puzzle-focused gameplay were turned off by it. The third boss was a chase scene, with players pursuing GLaDOS down a corridor. Wolpaw sharply criticized the pacing, which caused the players to wander around until they found the corridor, at which point a series of pistons would spring out of the walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;success&quot;/&gt;

The developers came to the conclusion that complex battles would only serve to confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a way to survive. He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this made no sense, commenting that it was one of the easiest puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in ''Half-Life 2: Episode Two'', the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotaku_devs&quot;/&gt; This made it easier on the writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure that everyone was able to see the game to the very end.&lt;ref name=&quot;success&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kumar |first=Matthew |title=Best Of GDC: The Secrets Of Portal's Huge Success |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17625 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton were mainly responsible for the single player campaign's story, while Chet Faliszek focused on the lines for GLaDOS in the cooperative campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;eginterview&quot;/&gt; ''Portal 2'' was originally not intended to feature GLaDOS or Chell, the player-character from ''Portal''. However, the demand for all of these to be implemented into ''Portal 2'' was great enough that they chose to do so. Originally, the character Cave Johnson was intended to be the antagonist instead and ''Portal 2'' to be a prequel.&lt;ref name=&quot;rps2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Walker |first=John |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/04/27/valve-on-portal-2-spoiler-interview-part-one/ |title=Valve On Portal 2: Spoiler Interview Part One |publisher=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |date=2011-04-27 |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before implementing Chell, they considered introducing a new player-character who would at one point inadvertently reactivate GLaDOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Welsh |first=Oli |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-04-24-portal-2-lets-make-caddyshack-interview |title=Portal 2: &quot;Let's make Caddyshack&quot; Interview |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2011-04-25 |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During play testing, Wolpaw found that there were two groups that were &quot;at-odds&quot;: one group was excited to see GLaDOS return, while the other did not want to wake her up and questioned why players would want to do that. As such, the character Wheatley was introduced, who inadvertently wakes GLaDOS while trying to escape the facilities with Chell. Wheatley and GLaDOS served as a contrasts to each other; where GLaDOS has a more &quot;computery-sounding&quot; voice due to her intelligence, Wheatley &quot;sounded perfectly human&quot; due to his lack of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;eginterview&quot;/&gt; Play testers were also bothered by the fact that the new protagonist was not recognized by GLaDOS when she awoke; as such, they changed the new character back into Chell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=yin-Poole |first=Wesley |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-10-portal-2-how-valve-opened-up-portal-2?page=2 |title=How Valve Opened Up Portal 2 Interview - Page 2 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpaw and the designers were not sure what to do with GLaDOS and were wary to do the same thing as the last game. They felt that she should &quot;go someplace&quot; and that since GLaDOS is &quot;kind of likeable in the first game&quot; and players &quot;enjoy being with her&quot;, they would utilize Wheatley as an &quot;other, external threat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eginterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Welsh |first=Oli |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-04-24-portal-2-lets-make-caddyshack-interview?page=2 |title=Portal 2: &quot;Let's make Caddyshack&quot; Interview - Page 2 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2011-04-25 |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of the game, GLaDOS introduces each chamber and congratulates the player on completing it; though they could have included intermediate dialog from GLaDOS while the player attempts to solve each chamber, they found this would be distracting to players and limited her presence in the game to only these points.&lt;ref name=&quot;gi p2 testchamber&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/17/thinking-with-portals-making-a-test-chamber.aspx | title = Thinking With Portals: Making a ''Portal 2'' Test Chamber | work = [[Game Informer]] | date =2010-03-17 | accessdate = 2010-03-17 | first =Ben | last = Reeves }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers considered having GLaDOS and Chell act as &quot;buddy cops against a new threat&quot;, but felt that since Chell never talked, it would not work. He compared her transformation into a potato and having her power stripped away to the game [[Jenga]]: &quot;You’re taking stuff off the bottom and seeing what happens.&quot; While she was in the potato form, the designers noticed a &quot;very stark difference between this imperious, all-powerful GLaDOS talking to you, and this powerless GLaDOS talking to you on your gun&quot;. They found that play testers were not interested in her when she was powerless and insulting players and would question why they were &quot;carting this person along&quot;. They decided to give her a personality shift and become Chell's &quot;sidekick&quot; on the basis that &quot;she can’t just be needling you for a half hour&quot;. In order to keep players from feeling that they should want to abandon GLaDOS in her powerless form to prevent her from becoming powerful again, the designers made sure to give players reason to bring her with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;rps2&quot;/&gt; In considering the interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, Erik Johnson compared GLaDOS to &quot;a jealous ex-girlfriend&quot;, noting &quot;[Chell is] the only person she can have interaction with, but the problem is her only way of interacting with anyone is to test them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra johnson interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6198/rewarding_the_players_valve_on_.php | title = Rewarding The Players: Valve On Portal 2 | first = Brandon | last= Sheffield | date= 2010-11-08 | accessdate = 2010-11-10 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; While they introduced new characters into the game, the focus of the story in ''Portal 2'' remained the connection and interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, and focuses more on the fallout from Chell's destruction of GLaDOS from the first game.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra wolpaw interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6141/synthesizing_portal_2.php | title = Synthesizing Portal 2 | first= Chris | last = Remo | date = 2010-09-20  | accessdate = 2010-09-20 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The co-operative campaign contains a separate story between the two robotic characters and GLaDOS.  The co-operative campaign includes additional dialog from GLaDOS; the original dialog Wolpaw wrote for GLaDOS was aimed to two women, Chell and a new character &quot;Mel&quot;, with the assumption of &quot;image issues&quot;, but this dialog remains in place even after the change of the co-op characters to robots.&lt;ref name=&quot;joystiq portal co-op&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/21/preview-portal-2-co-op/ | title = Preview: Portal 2 (co-op) | first = Christopher | last = Grant | date = 2010-06-21 | accessdate=  2010-06-21 | work = [[Joystiq]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialog written for GLaDOS in the co-operative campaign is aimed to try to break the bond between the two robot characters. Valve considered initially to have separate lines for GLaDOS that would be given to each player individually, but found this to be a significant effort for minimal benefit.

The writers found they needed another character to play off of Cave during his recordings; instead of hiring a voice actor for a few lines, they economized by reusing McLain to play Caroline, Cave's assistant.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamer wolpaw interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/04/26/erik-wolpaw-on-portal-2s-ending-the-spoiler-is-probably-lurking-out-there-somewhere/ | title = Erik Wolpaw on Portal 2’s ending: &quot;the [spoiler] is probably lurking out there somewhere&quot; | first = Rich | last = Stanton | date = 2011-04-26 | accessdate = 2011-04-26 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led naturally to providing a backstory for the creation of GLaDOS, who is revealed in-game to be based on Caroline's personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portal 2&quot;/&gt; This later led the writers to develop a full story arc for GLaDOS where she would come to recall her past, learn from it to solve the dilemma and then subsequently delete it and reset herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurogamer wolpaw interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-04-24-portal-2-lets-make-caddyshack-interview | title = Portal 2: &quot;Let's make Caddyshack&quot; | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = 2011-04-25 | accessdate = 2011-04-25 | first = Oli | last = Welch }}&lt;/ref&gt; The designers wanted to start GLaDOS' role in ''Portal 2'' off with her being &quot;incredibly upset at [Chell]&quot;. They felt however that this would &quot;get old pretty quick&quot; if they did not put her &quot;into another space&quot;. They accomplished this through a combination of her anger with Wheatley and her conflict with her past life as Caroline. Through the course of the game's events, GLaDOS' personality shifts significantly; however, at the end, she resets her personality to her original personality, an action Wolpaw sums up as &quot;explicitly reject[ing] it&quot; and saying &quot;You know what?

[[File:Gdc2010 newell portal BSOD.jpg|right|thumb|As part of the [[alternate reality game]] related to ''Portal 2''{{'}}s announcement at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]], Valve produced a [[blue screen of death]] which features GLaDOS' name in place of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] name.&lt;ref name=&quot;portalbsod_gdc&quot; /&gt;]]
GLaDOS has been used several times for reveals in the ''Portal'' series. At E3 2008, GLaDOS' voice was utilized to reveal the ''Portal'' expansion ''Portal: Still Alive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Molina |first=Brett |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2008/07/52683320/1 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |title=E3 2008: Inside Microsoft's press briefing |date=2008-07-14 |accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been used to show ''Portal 2'' reveals; initially, a [[Blue Screen of Death]] image was used instead of a reveal of ''Portal 2'', showing the typical text found in a blue screen of death, but with GLaDOS' name at the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;portalbsod_gdc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |url=http://kotaku.com/5491651/portal-2-hijacks-blue-screen-of-death-at-gdc-awards |title=Portal 2 Hijacks Blue Screen of Death At GDC Awards |publisher=Kotaku |date=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the reveal of the [[PlayStation 3]] version of ''Portal 2'', GLaDOS' voice was used to introduce [[Gabe Newell]], the co-founder of Valve Software at E3 2010, where he revealed ''Portal 2'' for the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;final hours&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | asin = B004XMZZKQ | title = The Final Hours of Portal 2 | chapter = 10: Making Games is Hard | first = Geoff | last = Keighley | year = 2011}} Also available as iPad or Steam application.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Portal 2''{{'}}s release was preceded by a collection of video games in a collection called ''[[Potato Sack]]'', which featured thirteen independently developed games. These games were all a part of an alternate reality, based on a cryptic narrative that suggested the awakening and relaunch of GLaDOS. Valve provided the developers access to their art assets to include ''Portal 2''-themed content into them, and in some cases, McLain recorded new dialog specifically for these games. The alternate reality game ultimately led to &quot;GLaDOS@Home&quot;, a [[distributed computing]] spoof, which prompted players to play the independently-developed games to awaken GLaDOS ahead of schedule, effectively promoting the Steam release of ''Portal 2'' about 10 hours earlier than the official time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/218877/play-indie-games-help-portal-2-release-early/ | title = Play indie games, help Portal 2 release early | first = Pete | last = Davidson | date = 2011-04-15 | accessdate=  2011-04-15 | publisher = [[GamePro]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/218877/play-indie-games-help-portal-2-release-early/&amp;date=2011-11-30+19:02:35|archivedate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/04/portal-2-early-launch/ | title = Play Steam Games, Launch Portal 2 Early | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date = 2011-04-15 | accessdate = 2011-04-15 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crossover-franchise game ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' includes a significant amount of ''Portal'' content, including a Lego-constructed GLaDOS (voiced by McLain) as one of the main villains in the game's primary story. The heroes are forced through more Aperture tests (in which she accuses them of cheating through the usage of the keystones and their abilities) and eventually defeat GLaDOS by introducing her to [[HAL 9000]] to distract her long enough to damage her. GLaDOS continues to appear in other areas through the main story, adding ''Portal''-themed elements to other worlds and eventually aiding the heroes in defeating the primary antagonist, and on conclusion of the game, she sings a song during the credits, &quot;You Wouldn't Know&quot;, again sung by McLain and written by Coulton. GLaDOS also acts as the primary antagonist in a bonus level set after the events of ''Portal 2'', wherein Chell and Wheatley defeat her by performing a core transfer using the Space Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/glados-steals-the-show-in-lego-dimensions-portal-moment-1732987396 | title = GLaDOS Steals the Show in LEGO Dimensions' Portal Moments | first = Mike | last= Fahey | date = 2015-09-25 | accessdate = 2015-09-25 | publisher = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and analysis==
Paste Magazine's Jason Killingsworth listed GLaDOS as the sixth best new character of the decade; he wrote that she &quot;may just be the most likable villain in video-game history&quot; and that &quot;we only killed her because we had to&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Killingsworth |first=Jason |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/11/the-10-best-video-game-characters-of-the-decade-20.html |title=The 10 Best Video Game Characters of the Decade (2000-2009) |publisher=Paste Magazine |date=2009-11-19 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editor for [[GamesRadar]] also called her one of the best new characters of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 25 best new characters of the decade |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-25-best-new-characters-of-the-decade/a-20091221171910974007 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |accessdate=2010-01-04 |date=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|title=GLaDOS chastises the player for their actions, only to become interrupted by a change in personality and voice.
|description=GLaDOS' voice is based on voice actor [[Ellen McLain]]'s attempts to mimic the playback of her original lines through a digitization process followed by further computer modulation. The change from her robotic voice to her more human-sounding voice required different modifications to be made to her voice after recording.

GLaDOS is frequently cited as both a quality villain and a quality computer character. IGN called her the greatest video game villain of all time, stating that while their time with her was short, she left a mark on players like no other villain has. They cited her uniqueness as being because no other players existed in the game. They also added she was more human than most video game villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/videogame-villains/1.html|title=Top 100 Videogame Villains - GLaDOS is number 1|publisher=IGN|date=May 2010|accessdate=May 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217030351/http://www.ign.com/videogame-villains/1.html|archivedate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com]] editor Scott Sharkey praised her as being the best insane video game computer. He stated that not only is she the best insane computer in video games, but in films and books as well. He explains his choice by citing her eagerness to kill the player-character, but not being overt about it until the end. He also cites her feminine voice and passive-aggressive manner for his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 5 Insane Computers |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3174288 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another article, he mentions how he feels more sorry for her than any other enemy, describing her as a &quot;digital version of the most passive-aggressive girlfriend ever&quot;.

GLaDOS has received praise for her humor and wit.

GLaDOS' mocking of Chell was met with negative reception from Neal Stapel, an adoptive parent profiled by 1UP.com. He stated that &quot;it literally pokes fun for not having parents&quot;, and stopped playing when he first heard the insult.

GLaDOS' appearance in ''Portal 2'' received critical acclaim.

[[GameZone]]'s Ben PerLee wrote that GLaDOS was the &quot;much brighter star of the franchise&quot; compared to Chell due to her role in ''Portal''. He also wrote &quot;the player’s interaction with her is absolutely amazing to watch. She is as vindictive and bitchy as ever, coating pure unadulterated hatred with a veneer of cool science&quot; and that &quot;for fans of GLaDOS, her return from her unfortunate death in the previous Portal is fabulous, and her literal transformation within the game will shock, wow, and humor even jaded gamers tired of cake quotes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox.gamezone.com/reviews/item/portal_2/ |title=Portal 2 Review &amp;#124; GameZone.com |publisher=Xbox.gamezone.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''PC Gamer''{{'}}s Dan Stapleton wrote that &quot;evil robot GLaDOS is in top politely murderous form right from the moment she appears on screen&quot; and that &quot;''Portal''{{'}}s show-stealing monotone antagonist is challenged for the spotlight by Wheatley&quot;.

===Comparison to other characters in fiction===
GLaDOS has been compared to characters in fiction, including HAL 9000 from the film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' by [[LucasArts]] designer Noah Falstein. He wrote that GLaDOS was &quot;more convincingly psychotic&quot; than HAL and that her dialogue was not typical &quot;like HAL['s]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;falstein&quot;/&gt; Falstein described her as the best AI he had ever encountered – &quot;more convincingly psychotic than HAL, with a more emotionally engaging death than [[Planetfall|Floyd]], and funnier than [[C-3PO]] and [[R2D2]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falstein&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3616/design_language_the_portal_.php?print=1 |title=Features - Design Language: The Portal Paradoxes |publisher=Gamasutra |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparison was also made by other critics such as journalist Stephen Totilo and IGN's Cindy White. Totilo wrote that HAL was an influence on GLaDOS' &quot;psychotic breakdown&quot; seen near the end of the first ''Portal'' title. White wrote HAL and GLaDOS were similar due to both having &quot;a calm, almost childlike, demeanor&quot; which &quot;hides nefarious intentions&quot;. She added that &quot;the prospect of being shut down causes them to act out in deadly ways&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;halglados&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= Cindy White |url=http://bluray.ign.com/articles/116/1163020p1.html |title=Movies to Watch if You Like Portal 2 - Blu-ray Feature at IGN |publisher=Bluray.ign.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GamesRadar editor Tyler Wilde stated that while the staff of GamesRadar loves GLaDOS, it makes no sense to insert a personality core into a robot.

He called her a &quot;sort of spiritual successor&quot; to SHODAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-malicious-machines/a-20110407173235610022 |title=Gaming's most malicious machines |publisher=GamesRadar |date= |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, PC Zone UK commented that the comparisons between GLaDOS and SHODAN run dry; while ''Portal'' leaves everything to the players' imagination, ''System Shock 2'' has a strongly defined storyline. They do, however, describe her breakdown as hysterical, desperate, and hilariously childish, calling it the most finely controlled breakdown since [[Patrick Bateman]]'s in the book ''[[American Psycho]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pczoneuk&quot;/&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' editors Nick Cowen and Tom Hoggins listed her as the ninth-greatest video game villain, stating that she is as diabolical as a female AI can get, mentioning SHODAN as being inferior in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowen |first=Nick |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/6140189/Top-10-video-game-villains.html |title=Top 10 video game villains |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-08-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[N'Gai Croal]] commented that the boss battle with GLaDOS is similar to the &quot;Room 19&quot; encounter with [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]] from ''BioShock'', citing the same use of tactical language and techniques between the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;totilo&quot;/&gt; In the book ''Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter'', Infinity Ward developer Michael Boon mentioned GLaDOS and BioShock character Andrew Ryan while discussing believable non-playable characters. He commented that while shooting games in general feature enemies as bullet magnets, both Andrew Ryan and GLaDOS do not provide an opportunity for players to shoot them. However, he adds that both characters end up defeating themselves, but in different ways. He stated that she was &quot;so entertaining&quot;, but also that he wanted to kill her. The book's author Tom Bissell stated that in addition to these similarities, both were well written, describing them as &quot;funny, strange, cruel, and alive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bissell |first=Tom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3pCgbJp_F0C |title=Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |page=80 |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-08-10|isbn=9780307379283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character analysis===
In his analysis of ''Portal'', Daniel Johnson points out that &quot;the larger chunk of ''Portal''{{'}}s narrative exists in GLaDOS' dialogue&quot;, which tells &quot;a metaphoric tale of a power struggle of identity roles within an institution&quot;. He discusses how the &quot;backstage&quot; of the institution is hinted at and gradually revealed through GLaDOS's slip-ups, from the momentary glitch during her initial instructions to the player (&quot;the first flaw in the routine&quot;) to her ultimate abandonment of the formal language of the institution as she desperately pleads with the player to return to the testing area (the &quot;front stage&quot;, where the institution's inner workings are supposedly hidden from view).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/23960/Analysis_Portal_and_the_Deconstruction_of_the_Institution.php |title=News - Analysis: Portal and the Deconstruction of the Institution |publisher=Gamasutra |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Game Studios]] developer Tom Abernathy, in discussing the importance of compelling characters in video games, praises ''Portal'' for giving its audience &quot;room to do some imagination work&quot; by inviting them to read between the lines to understand GLaDOS's motivations. His own interpretation is that GLaDOS is conflicted between her wants and needs, a conflict which ultimately &quot;causes her to go crazy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20252 |title=News - AGDC: MGS' Abernathy Talks Importance Of Game Characters |publisher=Gamasutra |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Totilo notes the &quot;artful way&quot; in which GLaDOS's antagonistic character is slowly revealed and defined throughout ''Portal'' despite &quot;little interactivity in how the story is told&quot;.  Of his own reaction to that character development, he writes, &quot;I wanted to hunt GLaDOS down, confront her for her lies, and break free of her clutches. I wanted this boss battle. I don't know if I ever have wanted a boss battle before.&quot; ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor N'Gai Croal describes her as a &quot;maternal, mischievous, malevolent and finally murderous unreliable narrator&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;totilo&quot;/&gt;

Video game developer Nathan Frost describes ''Portal'' as an &quot;exploration of a relationship with someone with [[narcissistic personality disorder]]&quot;. He adds that in order to fulfill her self-centered narcissistic desire to toy with someone, the player-character is trapped in the Enrichment Center, forced to do tricks for the computer. However, once the player-character becomes skilled enough to break the confines of the center, GLaDOS's secure amusement gives way to &quot;histrionic, bipolar deportment&quot;. He describes this as a parallel to how a real-life narcissist might attempt to secure the admiration of another person by empowering them in some ways, but limiting them in others. He adds that this works out well for the narcissist until the other person learns to think and act for themselves. He concludes by saying that a part of ''Portal''{{'}}s resonance comes from the fact that using the portal gun to escape the center is a &quot;cogent metaphor for escaping an intimate relationship with someone diagnosably narcissistic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;valve creative process&quot;/&gt; Grant Tavinor, author of ''The Art of Videogames'', wrote that GLaDOS' actions and personality in ''Portal'' were &quot;in the best of science fiction traditions&quot; and describes her as &quot;insincere, malfunctioning, and probably insane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tavinor |first=Grant |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LM3hnwGb8xUC |title=The art of videogames |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-05-04|isbn=9781444310184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Despain, author of ''Writing for Video Games Genres: from FPS to RPG'' used ''Portal'' as an example of a &quot;modern classic&quot; video game and &quot;how they tell their stories&quot;. She called GLaDOS an &quot;endlessly cheerful and clearly insane computer&quot; and called her narrative &quot;simple&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Despain |first=Wendy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IodvUgBggnUC |title=Writing for video game genres: from FPS to RPG |publisher=A K Peters, Ltd. |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-05-04|isbn=9781568814179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Short]], creator of a female artificial intelligence character in the video game ''[[Galatea (video game)|Galatea]]'', speculates that in GLaDOS's final remarks to Chell (“No one likes you, you know”), &quot;there is a hint that she’s talking about herself, not Chell; that she herself desires an emotional connection that she has never been able to achieve, because she also needs to survive, and all humans are a threat to her... [She has] learned that the humans view her as potentially threatening and essentially disposable, and so she has to see them the same way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Short|first=Emily|url=http://emshort.wordpress.com/2008/03/24/still-alive/|title=Still Alive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Rogers, author of the book ''Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design'', uses GLaDOS as an example of a &quot;tormentor&quot; boss character, stating that she taunts and challenges the players, but does not directly confront or attack them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rogers |first=Scott |title=Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8w_ETFmHrewC |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=318 |accessdate=2010-08-10|isbn=9780470970928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game developer Andrew Doull describes the &quot;[[unreliable narrator]]&quot; as a narrative staple from more traditional media, stating that GLaDOS is the best example of this staple in gaming. He cites a scene in ''Portal'' where GLaDOS tells the player-character that the current puzzle is unsolvable, which turns out to be false. However, he comments that &quot;it is still incredible to see the number of people who fail to read the situation, and proceed calmly to their death&quot; in the incinerator when ordered to do so by GLaDOS; he uses this example to support an argument that the &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; narrative technique might not transfer readily to the gaming medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doull |first=Andrew |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/24753/ |title=Analysis: Narrative - A Montage Without Music |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to other characters===
Associate Professor of English at the [[University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point]] G. Christopher Williams discussed the relationship between GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read &quot;we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, leading up to the point that you betray her and do the most intimate act you can do with someone—murdering them in cold blood&quot;, he at first noted that &quot;on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical&quot;, but also noted that &quot;a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one&quot;. He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist [[Sigmund Freud]] which Williams said was about &quot;murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents&quot;. He wrote &quot;nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship&quot;. He called her &quot;just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design&quot; and that &quot;this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay&quot;. He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote &quot;I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing ''me''. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill ''me''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=G. Christopher Williams |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/123220-an-intimate-moment-with-the-computer/ |title=An Intimate Moment With the Computer: PopMatters |publisher=Popmatters.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G. Christopher Williams also discussed the relationship between Wheatley and GLaDOS. His initial impression was that Wheatley, being an &quot;utter moron&quot; and attached to GLaDOS, was a political critique of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush]]. Namely, he thought that it would &quot;be a way of paralleling the mythos surrounding the origins of the Bush-Cheney White House as an opportunity for the Republicans to regain control of the White House through a less intellectually apt figurehead and to thus control their domain through this weaker authority figure&quot;; however, as he progressed, he saw nothing more to suggest that this was the intent. He added that the thought of this concept helped make him realize how ''Portal 2'' &quot;presents a fundamental conundrum that does exist surrounding competency and power&quot;. In contrast to this, he wrote that &quot;an extremely smart leader can be about the most oppressive force in an organization has already been provided in abundance for anyone who has played the first Portal&quot; and that &quot;GLaDOS's &quot;leadership&quot; is the very definition of sadistic fascism&quot;. He also discussed the &quot;lack of choice&quot; for Chell, who is required to reinstate GLaDOS into her position to escape. He wrote that this lack of choice &quot;manages to effectively maintain its position on the relationship between the everyman and systems of power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=G. Christopher Williams |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/140262-portal-2-and-the-politics-of-stupidity/ |title='Portal 2' and the Politics of Stupidity: PopMatters |publisher=Popmatters.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25%|quote=&quot;By fulfilling the expected obligations of a 1950s 'wife', Caroline sounds as if she might as well be married to Johnson, and after all, given Johnson's alignment with American exceptionalism and what it can achieve through technology, he is the 'science' that she has married herself to.&quot;|source=—Quote from Associate Professor of English at [[University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point]], G. Christopher Williams.&lt;ref name=&quot;caroline&quot;/&gt;}}
Williams also discussed the relationship between Caroline, the form she held before she became GLaDOS, and Cave Johnson. He wrote that the relationship of Caroline and Johnson fulfilled the &quot;adage that &quot;behind every good man is a good woman&quot;, since he depends on Caroline to fulfill the role of executing his directives as well as providing comfort and support for the man in charge, himself&quot;. He added that &quot;while Johnson warns his listeners jokingly that 'pretty as a postcard' Caroline is off limits because 'She's married. To Science,' he may as well be simply warning off potential suitors for personal reasons&quot; and wrote that &quot;he is the &quot;science&quot; that she has married herself to&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;caroline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=G.

===As a woman in video games===
G. Christopher Williams wrote that the addition of an &quot;intelligence dampening sphere&quot; performed by scientists on GLaDOS before the events of ''Portal'' could represent the &quot;response from men to what they perceive as the 'misbehavior' or 'irrational thinking' of women&quot;. He also wrote &quot;the effort to 'dampen' intelligence becomes a rather literal manifestation of the labeling of women as 'dumb' or 'irrational' and the need to control such 'poor' behavior&quot;; he also cited how Wheatley was given a masculine voice to &quot;remind her that she is dumb and to curb her tendency towards 'misbehavior'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;caroline&quot;/&gt; [[IGN]] wrote that she &quot;bucked&quot; all of the stereotypes of a woman in video games and &quot;became one of the most memorable and well-loved characters ever conceived&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Nick Kolan |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/114/1143124p2.html |title=Bringing a Bikini to a Sword Fight - PC Feature at IGN |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GamesRadar's Joe McNeilly wrote that ''Portal'' seemed like a &quot;feminist critique of the FPS genre, flawlessly executed from within the margins it assails&quot;. He called her a &quot;maternal female construct&quot; and that while she was programmed to react &quot;empathetically&quot; to the player, she is incapable of feeling emotion. As a result, he felt that she &quot;comes to represent man's attempt to construct an idealized mother figure through the cold logic of science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/xbox360/f/portal-is-the-most-subversive-game-ever/a-20071207115329881080/g-2006071916221774024 |title=Portal is the most subversive game ever, Portal Xbox 360 Features |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''GameInformer''{{'}}s Lix Lanier stated that no villain, male or female, has the charm of GLaDOS: &quot;If she's not trying to kill Chell, she's likely belittling her with passive-aggressive comments that would make a sorority girl proud. Even with her robotic voice, it's clear that 'You look great by the way, very healthy' is no compliment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Top Ten Female Villains | date = November 2013 | work = [[Game Informer]] | page=  24 | first = Lix | last = Lanier }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GamePro''{{'}}s Chris Holt discussed GLaDOS as an icon of feminism, and wrote that as opposed to being an &quot;archetypal villain&quot;, she is a &quot;prototypical bound woman&quot;. He added that &quot;A female protagonist murdering a female villainess (or vice versa) is not what is interesting to us as critics, but it's the idea that despite her seemingly robotic, unemotional and unstoppable nature, GLaDOS appears vulnerable, sympathetic, and even a victim herself&quot;. He wrote &quot;GLaDOS has been augmented because of the danger she presents to a presumably misogynistic society&quot; and that &quot;by destroying these cores, Chell is stripping her of the layers that society has deemed necessary for her to wear&quot; and making her &quot;far more dangerous&quot;. He added that Chell and GLaDOS serve as opposing sides of femininity; where Chell is &quot;dutiful and does every task assigned of her&quot;, GLaDOS is &quot;aggressive and seemingly dangerous to the order of a male-dominated society&quot;. He also described Chell as a &quot;domestic icon&quot; while he described GLaDOS as a &quot;progressive, intelligent working woman&quot; and that by killing her, &quot;Chell can be seen as the dutiful 'safe' woman conquering the 'dangerous' feminist&quot;. He also cited the use of poems by [[Emily Dickinson]], whom he compares to GLaDOS in how both were reclusive and were essentially disembodied voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holt |first=Chris |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/218965/portal-s-glados-as-feminist-icon-cont/ |title=Portal’s GLaDOS as Feminist Icon, page 2, Feature Story from |publisher=GamePro |date= |accessdate=2011-05-05|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/218965/portal-s-glados-as-feminist-icon-cont/&amp;date=2011-11-30+18:58:50|archivedate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the lack of female heroes in video games, particularly in video games published by [[Activision]], Gamasutra news director Leigh Alexander cited GLaDOS while arguing that the &quot;females do not sell&quot; notion is possibly false logic, stating that she was on the fast track to becoming one of gaming's most beloved characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29719/InDepth_No_Female_Heroes_At_Activision.php |title=In-Depth: No Female Heroes At Activision? |publisher=Gamasutra |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamasutra]] writers Leigh Alexander, Brandon Boyer, Simon Carless, and Christian Nutt listed GLaDOS as being the second-most affecting video game character, being the highest-ranked actual character because the most affecting video game character was the player. They attribute the overall quality of ''Portal'' to GLaDOS, stating that without her, ''Portal'' would not be nearly as quotable. They added that the relationship between GLaDOS and the player-character has been described as passive-aggressive, maternal, and a &quot;feminist manifesto&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;affecting&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 5 Most Affecting Characters |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3228/gamasutras_best_of_2007.php?page=2 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Gaara'''|我愛羅}} is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] in the ''[[Naruto]]'' [[manga]] and [[anime]] series created by [[Masashi Kishimoto]] as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the series' eponymous character, [[Naruto Uzumaki]], as the two were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly different personalities due to a troubled upbringing. Initially introduced as an antagonist, Gaara is a [[shinobi]] affiliated with [[World of Naruto#Sunagakure|Sunagakure]] and is the son of Sunagakure's leader, the Fourth Kazekage. He was born as a demon's host as part of his father's intention to have a weapon to restore their village. However, a combination of being ostracized by the Sunagakure villagers, his early inability to control the Tailed Beast, and the notion that his deceased mother called him her curse on the village caused Gaara to become a ruthless killer who believes his own purpose is to kill his enemies. Only after meeting Naruto Uzumaki does Gaara earn a change of perspective, as he eventually becomes Sunagakure's [[World of Naruto#Kage|Fifth Kazekage]] and gains acceptance by his people.

Gaara has appeared in several pieces of ''Naruto'' media, including two of the featured films in the series, the third original video animation, and several video games. Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Gaara's character. [[IGN]] labeled the disparity between Naruto and Gaara as &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;a tad creepy&quot;. [[Anime News Network]] called Naruto's fight against Gaara the high point of the entire series. Among the ''Naruto'' reader base, Gaara has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls and always making it to the top ten characters. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Gaara's likeness, including plush dolls, key chains, and action figures.

== Creation and conception ==
''Naruto'' author Masashi Kishimoto created Gaara as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki.  Naruto and he have a similar background: he was rejected by his peers and fellow villagers for being the host of a [[World of Naruto#Tailed Beasts|tailed beast]], Shukaku, a situation that Kishimoto describes as &quot;very much like Naruto's&quot;. Gaara's development from this state into a highly withdrawn, sadistic character was intended to induce sympathy for him from readers, as it was contrasted against Naruto's development into a cheerful troublemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto|title=Uzumaki: The Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, his design was designed to look like the Tanuki since Kishimoto thought that it would make him a good rival for Naruto's Nine-Tailed Demon Fox since several parts from the Shukaku were considered by Kishimoto to be opposite ones from the Demon Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=NARUTO|year=2009 |publisher=Shueisha |page=98 |isbn=978-4-08-874823-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaara's backstory became one of Kishimoto's favorite stories from [[List of Naruto chapters (Part I)|Part I]]; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters as he wanted readers to understand more of Gaara's mental state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=NARUTO―ナルト―［秘伝・闘の書］|year=2005 |publisher=Shueisha |pages=310–311 |isbn=4-08-873734-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaara's initial attire, along with the costumes of his siblings, was difficult for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave the three of them simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites ''[[The Matrix]]'', one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtBook127&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: The Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances ==

=== In ''Naruto'' ===
Before he was born, Gaara's father, the Fourth Kazekage Rasa, had [[List of Naruto characters#Chiyo|Chiyo]] make Gaara into the Jinchuriki for the [[World of Naruto#Tailed Beasts|tailed beast]] {{nihongo|Shukaku the One Tail|一尾の守鶴|Ichibi no Shukaku|English TV: &quot;Shukaku the Sand Spirit&quot;}} while he was still in his mother's womb before she died giving birth to him. Though believed at the time to be Shukaku's power in action, Gaara can manipulate sand, which subconsciously protects him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 10|year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 83|isbn=1-4215-1089-8 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beginning&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 11|year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 97 |isbn=1-4215-0241-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blood&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 15|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 128 |isbn=1-4215-0240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasa intended to use Gaara as the village's personal weapon, but Shukaku's bloodlust proved too much for Gaara as he suffered night terrors brought about by the tailed beast's influence. With Gaara's sand adding to his inability to control Shukaku, the boy became feared to the point his father decided to have him assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 15|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 131 |pages=93–95|isbn=1-4215-0240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 15|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 129 |isbn=1-4215-0240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 15|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 131|pages=89–91 |isbn=1-4215-0240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaara has the belief that he could only rely upon himself and Shukaku, and that he had to kill others in order to confirm the value of his own existence. He thus became narcissistic, even permanently scarring his left temple with the kanji for {{Nihongo|&quot;love&quot;|愛|ai}} for his new drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 15|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 131|isbn=1-4215-0240-2 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murder&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 7|year=2005 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 59 |isbn=1-59116-875-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaara first appears in the series when he is sent to [[World of Naruto#Konohagakure|Konohagakure]], an allied ninja village, to take part in the Chunin Exams alongside his older siblings [[List of Naruto characters#Kankuro|Kankuro]] and [[List of Naruto characters#Temari|Temari]]. In truth, he is sent in order to infiltrate Konohagakure in preparation for an invasion by Sunagakure and its ally, [[World of Naruto#Otogakure|Otogakure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 11|year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 95 |pages=92–98|isbn= 1-4215-0241-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he and Kankuro and Temari easily pass both the first and second phases. In the third phase, Gaara is set to fight against [[Rock Lee]]. Lee is able to pass Gaara's defenses, provoking an enraged Gaara into breaking Lee's arm and leg, claiming victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 10|year=2006 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 86|isbn=  1421502402}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sasuke Uchiha]] manages to give Gaara the first injury he has ever received, causing Gaara to suffer a mental breakdown and nearly manifest his Tailed-Beast powers. This begins the invasion, with his older siblings carrying him off as he could not participate in his current state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 13|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 115 |pages=136–138|isbn= 1-4215-1087-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sasuke and [[Naruto Uzumaki]] confront him with the latter defeating him.&lt;ref name=&quot;New&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 16|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 136 |isbn=1-4215-1090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Sunagakure sends Gaara to help in preventing Sasuke from defecting to Otogakure, which became enemy of Sunagakure once learning that Orochimaru murdered Rasa prior to the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 24|year=2008 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 213|isbn= 1-4215-1860-0 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he is able to help Lee fight Orochimaru's servant Kimimaro, Gaara is unable to prevent Sasuke from escaping from Konoha. He makes amends with the many characters he had alienated, apologizing to those he hurt and improving his relationship with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 24|year=2008 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 215 |pages=132–133|isbn= 1-4215-1860-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Gaara's fundamental characteristic becomes the desire to protect as many people as he can, as in doing so he believes, like Naruto, he will be able to find true strength. This culminates in his replacing his father as the Fifth Kazekage during Part II of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;protect&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 28|year=2008 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 249 |isbn= 1-4215-1864-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gaarapart2.jpg|thumb|100px|Gaara as he appears in [[List of Naruto chapters (Part II)|Part II]]]]
In Part II of the series, three years after his mission, [[List of Naruto characters#Deidara|Deidara]], a member of the criminal organization [[List of Naruto characters#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]], is sent to Sunagakure to capture Gaara. Gaara fights Deidara to protect the village, but is defeated. The members of the Akatsuki then kidnap him and extract Shukaku from his body.&lt;ref name=&quot;protect&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 29|year=2008 |publisher=Viz Media |chapter=Chapter 261 |isbn=1-4215-1865-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaara dies in the process, his body being recovered by Naruto and [[Kakashi Hatake]].

Rasa reveals the truth to Garra that his uncle's final action were his doing and that the truth that Gaara's mother always loved him, moving Gaara to tears after learning his mother's will is the force behind his sand. Rasa recognizes his son has surpassed him and entrusts Sunagakure to him after being defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 58|year=2011 |publisher=Shueisha|chapter=Chapter 547 |isbn=978-1-4215-4328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaara later defeats and seals the revived Second Mizukage and joins the rest of the five Kage to fight the [[Madara Uchiha]] who was reanimated by Kabuto, nearly getting killed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 59|year=2012 |publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 562 |isbn=978-1-4215-4942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 63|year=2012 |publisher=Shueisha|chapter=Chapter 601 |isbn=978-4-08-870550-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later healed by Tsunade, Gaara departs with the other Kage to site of their side's battle with Tobi. Before watching him be absorbed by the Gedo Statue again, Gaara manages to make his peace with Shukaku while thanking the tailed beast for ensuring that he would meet Naruto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 69|year=2014|publisher=Shueisha|chapter=Chapter 662|isbn=978-4-08-880054-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They take him to Minato Namikaze and Gaara holds off Madara before Might Guy takes over prior Naruto being successfully revived. Once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is activated, Gaara is caught in the illusion of being with his entire family and Naruto as his friend before being freed by Naruto and Sasuke. By the series epilogue, having the Hidden Leaf Village's Nara Clan as in-laws through Temari, Gaara remains active as the Kazekage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 72|year=2015|publisher=Shueisha|chapter=Chapter 700|isbn=978-4-08-880220-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'', his children participating in the event, Gaara and the other Kage attend the Chunin exam in Konoha before they engage in combat against Momoshiki and Kinshiki in a rescue mission after Naruto was kidnapped.

=== In other media ===
Gaara has made several appearances outside of the ''Naruto'' anime and manga. He is present in the second and sixth ''Naruto'' feature films, ''[[Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel]]'' and ''[[Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire]]''. In the former, he protects the Land of Wind from an assault by Haido, the antagonist of the film, and later battles the lightning user Ranke, one of Haido's subordinates, and defeats her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date = 2008 |title = Naruto The Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel|format = [[DVD]] |publisher = Viz Video|accessdate = 2009-03-22|url=http://www.viz.com/anime/dvd/naruto-the-movie-video-volume-2/7628}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the latter, he temporarily becomes enemies of Konohagakure as they are the prime suspect of a pitfall attack on him while he is about to attend a meeting with Tsunade, in reality being done by a missing nin, Hiruko, and briefly battles Naruto, although after the confusion is cleared, he allies himself with them again. Gaara is also present in the third [[original video animation]] released in the series, in which he participates in a tournament of various characters from across the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date = 2005 |title = ついに激突！上忍VS下忍！！無差別大乱戦大会開催！！|format = [[DVD]] |publisher = TV Tokyo|url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000BNPT3E/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Naruto video games|''Naruto'' video games]] commonly feature Gaara, including the [[Naruto: Clash of Ninja (series)|''Clash of Ninja'']] and [[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja (series)|''Ultimate Ninja'' series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNCoN2GuidePage2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/736/736611p2.html|title=Naruto: The Complete Fighter Profile - Page 2|author=Bozon, Mark|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-09-29|accessdate=2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GUIDE4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Tomy|title=Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Japanese instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Tomy|language=Japanese|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GUIDE1 26&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=|title=Naruto: Ultimate Ninja English instruction manual|year=2006|publisher=[[Namco Bandai]]|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some games, he uses his Shukaku form for combat, as well as other moves not seen in the anime or manga.

Anime and manga publications have mostly praised Gaara's character. [[IGN]] noted that Gaara was an &quot;anti-Naruto&quot;, possessing a &quot;dark, solemn character&quot; as opposed to Naruto's continuous cheer and excitement.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNNarutoReader&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anime.ign.com/articles/834/834323p4.html|title=IGN: Naruto Reader's Guide|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Sparrow, A.E.|date=2007-11-09|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another review, IGN also called Gaara's background &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;a tad creepy&quot; due to the disparity between the development of Naruto's and Gaara's personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/767/767826p1.html|title=IGN: An Assassin of the Moonlit Night Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Van Horn, Jason|date=2007-02-26|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anime News Network]] celebrated the &quot;depth and emotion&quot; that Naruto's and Gaara's similarities added to the plot, and commented that &quot;nowhere in the entire series run does ''Naruto'' shine brighter than in the peak period of his battle against Gaara&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNReviewDVD6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/naruto/dvd-uncut-dvd-box-set-6|title=Naruto Uncut DVD Box Set 6 - Review|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|author=Martin, Theron|date=February 29, 2008|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also complimented Kishimoto's visual presentation of Gaara in the manga, referring to &quot;chilling [glimpses] of Gaara's crazed, exposed face&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNNarutoManga8-10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/naruto-gn-8-10|title=Naruto GN 8-10 - Review|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|author=Kimlinger, Karl|date=2006-11-02|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mania Entertainment noted that Gaara and Sasuke's first fight shows how the former has a &quot;fragile&quot; psyche despite his violent attitude. His backstory was also praised by Mania Entertainment since it includes &quot;a ton of legitimate emotion&quot; allowing viewers from the series to understand more Gaara's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/naruto-box-set-06-also-wspecial-edition_article_79870.html|title=Naruto Box Set 06 (also w/special edition)|publisher=Mania Entertainment|author=Rich, Justin|date=June 18, 2008|accessdate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liam O'Brien]], Gaara's voice actor in the English dubbed version of the anime, has been praised. IGN noted that he did an &quot;excellent job&quot; of making Gaara sound terrifying to the viewer,&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNEpisodeGaaraIdentityReview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/763/763656p1.html|title=IGN: Astonishing Truth!

Gaara's promotion to leader from Sunagakure in Part II of the series was deemed as the most surprising development in the series by Briana Lawrence from Mania Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/naruto-vol-28_article_83777.html |title=Naruto Vol. #28 |publisher=Mania Entertainment |author=Lawrence, Briana |date=February 27, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025193834/http://www.mania.com/naruto-vol-28_article_83777.html |archivedate=October 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Anime Network's Kevin Leathers stated that while in the first part of the series, Gaara was a fearsome villain, in the following one he became &quot;much more three-dimensional.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ukanim&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Naruto_Shippuden_Box_Set_1.html|title=Anime Review: Naruto Shippuden Box Set 1|publisher=UK Anime Network|author=Leathers, Kevin|date=July 19, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Todd Douglass Jr. from [[DVD Talk]] praised Gaara's development in later episodes from ''Naruto: Shippuden'' owing to his relationship's expansion with Naruto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/42122/naruto-shippuden-8/|title=Naruto Shippuden, Vol. 8|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|author=Douglass Jr., Todd|date=April 6, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fight against Deidara has also received positive response, with critics poiting the revisit of Gaara's popular moves and the strategy both fighters employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukanim&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/848/848479p1.html|title=Naruto Vol. 28 Review|publisher=IGN|author=Sparrow, A.E.|date=January 29, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Played by [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]], he is shown in the movie ''Sholay'' as a [[dacoit]] who leads a group in looting and plundering the villages in the region of Ramgarh.

==Development==
[[Danny Denzongpa]]  was the first choice of Gabbar but had to miss out because he was shooting for [[Dharmatma]] in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=toi1&gt;{{cite news|title=Danny Denzongpa’s loss|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-08-30/did-you-know-/27922509_1_danny-denzongpa-bandit-feroz-khan|work=Article|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=Nov 20, 2011|date=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] was almost dropped from the project because [[Javed Akhtar]] found his voice too weak for Gabbar Singh's role but was later convinced. For his preparation for the role Amjad read Abhishapth Chambal, a book on Chambal dacoits written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri (actress Jaya Bhaduri's father).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Anupama|authorlink=Anupama Chopra|title=[[Sholay: The Making of a Classic]]|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books, India|isbn=0-14-029970-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of speech==
Gabbar's language was a mixture of North Indian [[Khariboli]] and Hindi, which was something new for the audiences so the dialogues were an instant hit and are still popular in India. Javed Akhtar says that Gabbar seemed to acquire life and vocabulary of his own as he wrote the film. His sadism lies in his choice of words like &quot;Khurach, khurach (scratch)&quot; when he talks to [[Hema Malini]].&lt;ref name=tag1 &gt;{{cite web|author=Meenal Baghel |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/Storyold/135702/ |title=Once upon a time in Ramgarh |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=1999-12-05 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amjad shot to stardom with the movie. His mannerisms and dialogues have become an integral part of Bollywood lexicon.&lt;ref name=filmfare /&gt; ''Sholay'' went on to become a blockbuster, and is the highest grossing movie in India. Although the movie boasted an ensemble cast of superstars including Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan, he stole the thunder with his unorthodox and eerie dialogue delivery that was perfectly opposite to the total lack of empathy his character was supposed to convey. Even after thirty five years people fondly remember his dialogues and mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Ruma|title=Tera kya hoga, Gabbar Singh?|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore-times/Tera-kya-hoga-Gabbar-Singh/articleshow/2161793.cms|accessdate=28 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later appeared in advertisements as Gabbar Singh endorsing Britannia Glucose Biscuits (Popularly knowns as &quot;Gabbar Ki Asli Pasand&quot;), and it was the first incidence of a villain being used to sell a popular product.

'''Gabi Hernandez''' is a fictional character from the American soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. The role was introduced by the show's then head writers [[Dena Higley]] and Christopher Whitesell on November 20, 2009. Gabriela Rodriguez won the part after successfully auditioning. However, months into her portrayal, the decision was made to age Gabi. In July 2010, it was announced that Rodriguez was replaced by former ''[[One Life to Live]]'' actress Camila Banus. Banus had previously auditioned for the role but was turned down, and rejected her first offer to return before finally accepting. She first aired on October 4, 2010.

Originally described as a sweet, innocent and loving girl, a number of events since Gabi's arrival on the series have altered her personality. Both actresses have admitted to sharing similarities with Gabi. In 2012, the character experienced a huge personality shift, which would reveal her manipulative side that was called &quot;crazy&quot; and obsessive. Her storylines have included the death of her sister [[Arianna Hernandez]] ([[Lindsay Hartley]]), finding out that her first love was gay, and romances with [[Chad DiMera]] ([[Casey Deidrick|Casey Jon Deidrick]], [[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]) and [[Nick Fallon]] ([[Blake Berris]]). Gabi is of Latin descent, and Banus has expressed her pride to represent the Hispanic community through her portrayal. Banus' portrayal of Gabi earned her a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2015.

== Casting ==
Gabriela Rodriguez first appeared in the role of Gabi on November 20, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC&quot; /&gt; Of auditioning, Rodriguez said &quot;It was honestly so random. I had never auditioned for a soap opera before and I was like &quot;wow this is different. I think I want to give it a try.&quot; She seemed like such a cool girl, I was like &quot;hey let's go for it.&quot; [...] I ended up talking with the casting director for a while and she just kind of explained to me about the character [...] The next day I got called for a callback and that was that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rod&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Nobles|first=Omar|title=Getting To Know Gabriela Rodriguez|url=http://tvsourcemagazine.com/interviews/television/1920-getting-to-know-gabriela-rodriguez|work=TVSource Magazine|publisher=SoSource Media|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Hispanic actress Camilla Banus had also auditioned. Banus stated &quot;I went in and read for the role. It was actually a pretty long process. The first audition then the second audition, then I went in again to meet the casting director and the producer. They then said they wanted me for a screen test. I did the screen test and they ended up not choosing me. They ended up going with the other girl [Rodriguez]. They told me that they wanted to go a little bit younger for the part.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Casting&quot; /&gt;

== Character development ==

===Characterization and family===
Initially, Gabi was &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;innocent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Deese|first=Hollie|title=Interview: Days of Our Lives’ Camila Banus|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/daysofourlives/news/id/26237/Interview_Days_of_Our_Lives%E2%80%99_Camila_Banus/|work=She Knows Soaps|publisher=She Knows Soaps Entertainment|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with ''TV Source'' magazine, Rodriguez described Gabi as &quot;very loving&quot;, and said &quot;even though sometimes she can come off like loudmouth and just like I guess bratty, but she's not. She's a really good girl and has a really big heart. She loves her brother and sister and would do anything for them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rod&quot; /&gt; Rodriguez said that she is sensitive, has a strong personality and shows her soft side with people she's &quot;comfortable with&quot;, and believed these were all traits Gabi has.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rod&quot; /&gt; Banus feels that she is like Gabi in the sense that she's &quot;very, very sassy&quot;, stating &quot;When Gabi has that kind of fiery thing, that’s totally Camila. Gabi is very motherly and likes helping the people that she loves, which is very much like me as well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BI&quot; /&gt; She said that Gabi is sensitive when people say things about her.&lt;ref name=&quot;BI&quot; /&gt; Gabi has three siblings: [[Rafe Hernandez|Rafe]] ([[Galen Gering]]), [[Arianna Hernandez|Arianna]] ([[Lindsay Hartley]]) and Dario Hernandez (Francisco San Martin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/daysofourlives/cast/941/Dario_Hernandez/ |title=Dario Hernandez Played by Francisco San Martin on Days of Our Lives - Soaps.com |publisher=Soaps.sheknows.com |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodriguez said that although they get into &quot;little bickering fights every once in a while&quot;, the siblings love each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rod&quot; /&gt; Banus said that compared to her three siblings, Gabi &quot;is extremely independent, responsible and she has been on her own for a little bit&quot;, but noted that &quot;She is a family girl and loves taking care of family.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot; /&gt; She enjoys working with Galen, having stated &quot;I love working with him. I think he’s my favorite person to work with, because we just have that brother and sister relationship.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BI&quot; /&gt;

Banus loves playing the &quot;evil bitch&quot;-type character,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; and had that opportunity when Gabi underwent a personality change in 2012. [[About.com]] said that she was &quot;the epitome of sweetness and light&quot; but a rocky road led by finding out her first love [[Will Horton]] ([[Chandler Massey]]) was gay lead the character to undergo a &quot;major personality switch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Lauro|first=Janet|title=Camila Banus on Days of Our Lives' Obsessive Gabi|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2012/07/11/camila-banus-on-days-of-our-lives-obsessive-gabi.htm|work=[[About.com|About]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Gabi's transformation from a &quot;sweet girl&quot; to doing terrible things, Banus said &quot;things I think are going on in Gabi’s head that nobody gets to see&quot;. The actress who enjoys playing the &quot;dark side of Gabi&quot; credited Ariana's death as the reasoning for Gabi's life going downhill.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot; /&gt; The actress sent a message to fans, &quot;I want to tell them to be patient with me. The girl they once knew will come back.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot; /&gt; The new Gabi was described as &quot;obsessive and crazy&quot; and also &quot;manipulative&quot; and &quot;psycho&quot;, which received flack from fans. Banus confessed to seeing the backlash on [[social media]] websites including [[Twitter]]. She said &quot;People say mean things, but it doesn’t really get to me at all. I’m used to it&quot;. She noted that her previous role, Lola Montez on ''[[One Life to Live]]'', was worse, stating &quot;When I was on One Life to Live I was worse than Gabi is right now. She was a bad girl. She popped holes in [[condom]]s. That’s pretty bad. She took acid. That’s pretty bad.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BI&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVG&quot; /&gt;

=== Relationship with Chad DiMera ===
While the role was still being portrayed by Rodriguez, Gabi had a brief romance with [[Chad DiMera]] (Casey Jon Deidrick). However, Chad left her for [[Mia McCormick]] ([[Taylor Spreitler]]). Rodriguez said that Gabi was still into him, but was &quot;heartbroken because they really didn't have a chance at a real relationship. It was just kind of left like on the verge of something new and interesting. She was just starting to like him and she didn't know where it was going.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rod&quot; /&gt; She felt that the relationship had potential, as Gabi still &quot;might have a little thing for him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rod&quot; /&gt;

In January 2012, the romance was re-visited in a storyline which Deidrick felt that the writers dropped their brief past, and &quot;You'd never know that happened if you were tuning into Days for the first time now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Logan|first=Michael|title=Is it Love — or Lunacy — For Days of Our Lives' Chad and Gabi?|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Love-Lunacy-Days-of-Our-Lives-1041591.aspx|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabi and Chad became &quot;superstar models&quot; as the new faces of [[Countess Wilhelmina Cosmetics]]. This included a &quot;steamy ad campaign&quot;, which Banus described as them having &quot;no clothes and they're dripping wet. It's pretty intense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MORE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Fairman|first=Michael|title=What will happen when DAYS Chad and Gabi become Supermodels?|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/what-will-happen-when-days-chad-and-gabi-become-supermodels/2012/01/17/|work=On-Air On-Soaps|publisher=Michael Fairman Soaps, Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chad was in a committed relationship with [[Melanie Jonas]] ([[Molly Burnett]]) at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;MORE&quot; /&gt; ''On-Air On-Soaps'' wrote: &quot;So will this be a case of fatal attraction? If so, Melanie better watch out, given that we have seen Banus play man-crazy when she went off the rails as ''One Life to Live''{{'}}s Lola Montez.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MORE&quot; /&gt; Banus felt that it wasn't love, but an infatuation, &quot;[Gabi] is obsessed with having the ideal boyfriend because she has never had an ideal boyfriend. The person she thought was the ideal boyfriend turned out to be gay.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot; /&gt; She also noted during an interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'' that &quot;Gabi is attracted to Chad and she sees this modeling thing as a way to be near him.&quot; Everyone at the photoshoot felt that they made a good couple, while Deidrick said &quot;Meanwhile, Chad's like, &quot;Huh? What?&quot; He's clueless.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVG&quot; /&gt; Banus called her attraction to Chad a &quot;rebound&quot; from Will; Deidrick said &quot;He's oblivious to her feelings, which is hard because Camila is such a beautiful woman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVG&quot; /&gt; Gabi was shocked to find out that Chad was dating Melanie when she showed up to the photoshoot and shared a kiss with Chad.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVG&quot; /&gt;

Banus said that Gabi: &quot;sees Chad with Melanie and realizes she is not the girl for Chad. Gabi is the girl for Chad. So she focuses all her time and devotes her energy to making sure that is clear to him. At the point where they are at, I think she would do a lot to get that, and that is where she is at right now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot; /&gt; However, she noted that &quot;Melanie, deep down, is really her friend. And honestly, she really does care about Melanie a whole lot and never wants to see her get hurt.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot; /&gt; Gabi knew Melanie being  kidnapped by her stalker, Andrew but didn't do anything because Andrew blackmailed her.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC&quot; /&gt; Chad discovered this and has since had a bitter vendetta against Gabi, despising her.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC&quot; /&gt;

=== Relationship with Will Horton ===
[[File:Chandler Massey 4.jpg|thumb|200px|Chandler Massey ''(pictured)'' plays Gabi's &quot;first love&quot;, Will Horton. The couple split after he came out as gay]]
Following Arianna's tragic death, Gabi leaned on her sister-in-law [[Sami Brady]]'s ([[Alison Sweeney]]) son, [[Will Horton]] ([[Chandler Massey]]) for support.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/gabriela.php |title=About DAYS: Who's Who in Salem &amp;#124; Gabi Hernandez &amp;#124; Days of our Lives @ |publisher=Soapcentral.com |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of a possible Will and Gabi pairing, Rodriguez said &quot;I think that would be so perfect. They're so compatible. They're just very good people. I think that would be fun, and I think the audience would like that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rod&quot; /&gt; Both [[virginity|virgin]]s, the couple had sex. However, Will soon lost all interest in sleeping with her again which was unsettling to Gabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Lauro|first=Janet|title=Days of Our Lives Confirms Will Is Gay|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2011/11/01/days-of-our-lives-confirms-will-is-gay.htm|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banus said &quot;To be completely denied by him in this way is definitely going to make her feel like something is wrong with her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;On Gay SL&quot; /&gt; She also stated &quot;Gabi loves Will. Before they were ever boyfriend and girlfriend, they were best friends, who were there for each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;On Gay SL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Lauro|first=Janet|title=Camila Banus Torn over the End of Days of Our Lives' Will and Gabi|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2011/11/15/camila-banus-torn-over-the-end-of-days-of-our-lives-will-and-gabi.htm|work=[[About.com|About]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then announced by ''Days of our Lives'' that Will would come out as gay. Banus looked forward to playing the &quot;fallout&quot;, and said &quot;For me there are so many questions [...] How is Gabi going to react? Is she going to turn to somebody [else]? Is she going to break up with Will? Is he going to go behind her back? So many things could happen that could affect Gabi, her brother, Sami ... It's going to be an amazing storyline.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;On Gay SL&quot; /&gt; Previewing Gabi's reaction, the actress said: &quot;I feel like when it happens she is going to understand what it was. She is going to go through all those occasions where she felt something weird between them and know what it was. Obviously she will feel hurt because she's invested a lot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot; /&gt; The couple eventually parted ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot; /&gt;

Banus said that Gabi knew things weren't &quot;completely 100 percent&quot; during their relationship despite the fact that she loves and cares for him. She explained that &quot;when they do break up and he comes out to her, she always honestly feels like everything is her fault. And she blames herself for a lot of things.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDI&quot; /&gt; Chandler said &quot;Will loves her as well. There is just no sexual/physical attraction.&quot; Prior, viewers picked up on the fact that Will's lack of physical connection with her became one of Gabi's &quot;minor obsessions&quot;. Banus joked that his affection was &quot;all she wants&quot;. Chandler noted that &quot;There's no doubt Will loves Gabi [...] It's just not in the 'let's get freaky' way&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Dallman|first=William|title=Day of Days 2011: An Interview With Chandler Massey &amp; Camila Banus|url=http://tvsourcemagazine.com/interviews/television/2221-day-of-days-2011-an-interview-with-chandler-massey-a-camila-banus|work=TVSource Magazine|publisher=SoSource Media|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the actor felt that the show &quot;didn't drop the dynamic&quot; of the couple after he came out, but it became &quot;more powerful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fairman|first=Michael|title=Chandler Massey &amp; Camila Banus Interview – A Day of DAYS 2011|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/days-of-our-lives/chandler-massey-camila-banus-interview-a-day-of-days-2011/2011/11/12/|work=On-Air On-Soaps|publisher=Michael Fairman Soaps, Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nick Fallon and pregnancy ===
In August 2012, Will and Gabi both ended up having &quot;a bad week&quot; and have sex, despite him previously announcing he was gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Lauro|first=Janet|title=Days of Our Lives' Will and Gabi Have Sex|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2012/08/20/days-of-our-lives-will-and-gabi-have-sex.htm|work=[[About.com|About]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing developed from this.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC&quot; /&gt; Following her ordeal with Will, Banus said &quot;Gabi needs a man. It’s really important. If she doesn’t get a man soon, she’s going to go ballistic. It needs to be somebody that she doesn’t choose, but they choose her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BI&quot; /&gt; It was announced that [[Blake Berris]] would return as former &quot;braniac&quot; [[Nick Fallon]] who was just let out of [[prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NICKGAB&quot; /&gt; Banus said that if he was paired with Gabi, they could be &quot;crazy together&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BI&quot; /&gt; Nick and Gabi eventually inched closer and quickly began a romance in October 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC&quot; /&gt; During an interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', Banus explained their relationship: &quot;Since both Gabi and Nick were in such dark places in their lives, they don't trust what is happening to them... There's a part of them that feels, I'm not good enough to have this happen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NICKGAB&quot; /&gt; Berris said: &quot;Camila is very funny, and I'm not sure she gets to play that often on screen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NICKGAB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Lauro|first=Janet|title=Days' Blake Berris and Camila Banus Tell All|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2012/11/19/days-blake-berris-and-camila-banus-tell-all.htm|work=[[About.com|About]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Berris said of the pairing: &quot;I love Camila. She’s awesome, and Nick and Gabi are an interesting pairing. Both characters have gone through so much. I like how slowly they built [the relationship].

That November, Gabi received shocking news that she was pregnant. Janet Di Lauro of [[About.com]] said &quot;Let's face it. It's a move viewers saw coming, after a down-and-out Gabi shared a night of passion with her gay ex, Will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Lauro|first=Janet|title=Days of Our Lives' Gabi Is Pregnant!|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2012/11/12/days-of-our-lives-gabi-is-pregnant.htm|work=[[About.com|About]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabi nearly had an [[abortion]] but decided to go ahead with the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Greg|title=Days of Our Lives: Will and Gabi head to a clinic but can they go through with ending her pregnancy?|url=http://greginhollywood.com/days-of-our-lives-will-and-gabi-head-to-a-clinic-but-can-they-go-through-with-ending-her-pregnancy-77091|work=Greg In Hollywood|publisher=greginhollywood.com|accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Will being the unborn baby's biological father, Gabi and Nick convinced Will to let them raise the baby as their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr |first=Luke |title=Will Gives in to Nick’s Plan on Days of Our Lives |url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/12/06/will-gives-in-to-nicks-plan-for-his-child-on-days-of-our-lives |work=[[Zap2It]] |publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]] |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |date=December 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209020723/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com:80/2012/12/06/will-gives-in-to-nicks-plan-for-his-child-on-days-of-our-lives |archivedate=December 9, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed, and they have begun planning their wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr |first=Luke |title=Could Will Cause Trouble For Gabi and Nick on Days of Our Lives? |url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/12/11/could-will-cause-trouble-for-gabi-and-nick-on-days-of-our-lives |work=[[Zap2It]] |publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]] |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |date=December 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113042030/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com:80/2012/12/11/could-will-cause-trouble-for-gabi-and-nick-on-days-of-our-lives |archivedate=January 13, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding didn't happen since Will revealed he's the father of Gabi's baby. She and Nick get married in March 2013 and she gave birth to her daughter, Arianna Grace Horton in May 2013.

When Nick plots to remove Will from Arianna's life and become her primary guardian, Gabi and Nick have a physical altercation in which Gabi strikes him with a rock to keep him from raping her, &quot;killing&quot; him (or so she believes). Sami and Kate help Gabi dump him in the river in which he wakes up before believing he drowned. However, he returns continues to blackmail Gabi until the character was killed in a [[whodunit]] murder mystery.

== Storylines ==

===2009–14===
Gabriella Josephina Hernandez is born in 1992 or 1993 in Salem, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Arianna Horton's birth certificate list Gabi's full name, Gabriella Josephina Hernandez, age, 20, and apparently place of birth as Salem. June 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camila Banus listed Gabi's name as Gabriela Josefina Hernandez on Twitter. June 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the younger sister of Rafe, the late Arianna, and Dario Hernandez. Rafe and Arianna felt that they were being stalked while at the Brady pub, but were shocked to find out that Gabi had come to Salem and was spying on them. Initially for her winter break, Gabi decided to permanently move to Salem, and moved into a vacant room at the Brady Pub. Arianna and Gabi briefly argued but eventually bonded. She befriended other local teens including Chad Peterson-Woods (later revealed to be Chad DiMera). They briefly dated, but he left her for Mia. Saddened by the break-up, Gabi focused herself fully on school. She befriended Will Horton who attended the Salem High formal as her date. Arianna was killed in a [[hit-and-run]] accident. She leaned on Will for support and they shared their first kiss. The couple's romance deepened as they were there for one another during mutual times of crisis. They slept together, but Gabi noticed that Will didn't want to sleep with her again. He later came out as gay, and they split up. Gabi earned a job at [[Quinn Hudson]]'s (Bren Foster) Intensity Day Spa and developed another crush on Chad, and began scheming to break him and his girlfriend [[Melanie Jonas]] ([[Molly Burnett]]) up. To make Chad worry over her, she pretended to have a stalker, writing fake threatening notes. Chad had Gabi move in with him. So further keep up with her lie, she hired a guy named Andrew to pose as her stalker. Eventually, Andrew's actions became too much and Gabi told him to stop. He ended up kidnapping Melanie, to Gabi's knowledge. Andrew blackmailed Gabi into not telling anybody about Melanie. The truth was eventually revealed, and Chad hated Gabi for it. Feeling down, she ended up having a [[one night stand]] with Will, but agreed that it was a mistake. Chad consistently reminded Gabi that she would continue to pay for what she did. She then began a relationship with Nick, who was released from jail after serving time because he kidnapped Melanie. Nick reassured everyone he was a changed man. Chad assaulted Nick, who promised not to press charges if Chad dropped his threats towards Gabi, which he did. Gabi and Nick began planning their happy future, but she realized that she was pregnant with Will's child. Eventually, Gabi, Nick and Will decided that they would pretend that Nick is the father, and Gabi and Nick decided to get married. But when Gabi accidentally let it slip that she is further along than she originally said, Nick covered for her, saying that the two had a one-night stand the day they met. Despite there being some anger at this, everyone has accepted the duo as a couple, except for Chad, who wants Gabi to pay for her misdeeds. Chad told [[Sonny Kiriakis]], Will's boyfriend, about Gabi's role in Melanie's kidnapping. Ever since, Sonny has cut all his ties to Gabi and warned Will to avoid her. On May 20, 2013, Gabi gave birth to a daughter, Arianna Grace Horton, after Gabi's sister and Rafe's deceased goddaughter. Nick finally tells Gabi about what happened to him in prison, and what he did to Will. Gabi moves in with Will, Sonny and baby Arianna and her marriage to Nick is annulled. Despite being divorced, Nick continued to be obsessed with Gabi. When Gabi refused his advances, he tried to rape her. Gabi took a rock and bashed Nick on the head. Sami and Kate arrived and help Gabi throw Nick's body in the water. Nick briefly woke up before sinking into the water, and Gabi was haunted by the fact that they had let him die. On the day of Arianna's christening, Nick showed up at the ceremony alive, and lied about the events that happened that night. Nick wanted to reconcile with Gabi and slowly spent time with her and Arianna. He tried to get Gabi to take Arianna away from Will, but was eventually shot and killed with Gabi revealed to be the shooter. Gabi explained that she was scared of Nick's influence over her and felt she had to kill him to stop him from being a threat to Arianna. She also admitted her role in Melanie's kidnapping and told Marlena about her, Kate and Sami throwing Nick in the river. EJ, who served as Gabi's lawyer, thought it would be better for her to have a plea deal than go to trial and have the truth about Melanie's kidnapping come out. Gabi accepted the plea deal and got ten to twenty years in prison.

Gabi is visited by Rafe and later on by Will, Sonny and Arianna for the holidays. She gets another visitor, but it's Melanie, instead of Will and Sonny, who forgave Gabi her past decisions.

===2015–===
Gabi is released from prison in September 2015 and shares a happy reunion with Rafe, Will and Arianna thanks to an error made in her sentencing. As Gabi settles back into her life and relaunches her modeling career when Kate hires her at ''Basic Black'' working opposite retired baseball player [[Paul Narita]] ([[Christopher Sean]]), she is devastated when Will is murdered by a serial killer. The killings lead to Gabi's reunion with her estranged father Eduardo ([[A Martinez]]) for the first time since she was an infant as one of the serial killer victims is Gabi's half-sister [[Paige Larson|Paige]] ([[True O'Brien]]). Gabi bonds with [[JJ Deveraux]] ([[Casey Moss]]) and in December 2015, they begin dating.

== Reception ==
Janet Di Lauro of [[About.com]] said that the character is crazy and &quot;naughty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BI&quot; /&gt; Of being the only [[Hispanic]] during her time on ''Days of Our Lives'', Banus stated in 2012: &quot;I’m definitely grateful. I’m proud be a Latina, and I’m really proud to represent for all the Latinas out there; especially the young Latina women. It’s important for them to have a role.

His first victim was his first wife, named Soledad Valdez, who had a heart attack and died in 1991, but the doctors believed that maybe she had been poisoned.

'''Gabrielle''' is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Renee O'Connor]] in the American fantasy TV series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (1995-2001). She is referred to by fans as the Battling [[Bard]] of [[Potidaea]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Her trademark weapons are the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Quarterstaff|fighting staff]] and later, the [[sai (weapon)|sais]]. She was also an [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Princess]] and later an [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Queen regnant|Queen]]. The character's development and progression is a story that spans the entire show's run, with her first appearance in &quot;Sins of the Past&quot; seeing her as a naive farm girl, and the final episode, &quot;A Friend In Need (Part 2)&quot; seeing her as a fully formed but rational warrior, set to follow in the deceased Xena's footsteps.

The dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and its moon [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]] had the interim names &quot;Xena&quot; and &quot;Gabrielle&quot; until they were officially named.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Creation and production==
O'Connor was chosen to play the role after she impressed producers with her performance in the ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|Hercules]]'' [[television movie]] ''[[Hercules and the Lost Kingdom|The Lost Kingdom]]''.

In the two musical episodes,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bitter Suite&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bitter Suite|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1998-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle's singing voice was mainly provided by Susan Wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Susan Wood&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940020/ Susan Wood on the IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; (This may be because in another brief musical portion of the fourth season episode &quot;If the Shoe Fits..&quot;, Renee O'Connor's voice sounded like that of an opera singer.) In the episode &quot;[[Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire]]&quot;, O'Connor sang the chorus in &quot;War&quot; and the rap lead in &quot;Gettin' Ready&quot;.

''Gabrielle'' is the [[French language|French]] feminine form of the [[given name]] [[Gabriel]], the [[Archangel]], from the [[Hebrew]] meaning &quot;messenger of God&quot;. The Greek transliteration of &quot;Gabrielle&quot; would be Γαβριέλα, (Gavriela).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whoosh.org/issue79/reams3.html|title=A Woman of Deception: Gabrielle???!|publisher=Whoosh.org|accessdate=2007-05-16}}{{Verify credibility|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Xena Italian dub, the character was renamed &quot;Olimpia&quot;.

==Character history==

===From farm girl to warrior===

When Gabrielle first meets [[Xena]], she is a farm girl living in the village of [[Potidaea]]. She and her sister, [[Lila (Xena)|Lila]], along with several other village girls, have been kidnapped by the men of the warlord, [[Draco (Xena)|Draco]], to be sold as [[slavery|slaves]]. Xena intervenes and rescues them. Awed by her fighting skills, Gabrielle decides that she wants to become a warrior too. She also wants to avoid the marriage that her parents, Herodotus and Hecuba, have arranged for her with her childhood friend [[Perdicas]]. Gabrielle insists on following an initially reluctant Xena on the road.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sins&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sins of the Past|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1995-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two women soon develop a strong bond of love and friendship; by the sixth season it is heavily implied that this relationship has become romantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;young&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2005/09/15/xena/index.html?pn=2|title= What we owe Xena|accessdate=2 January 2007 |last=Young |first=Cathy |date=15 September 2005 |work=Salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the six years of the series, Gabrielle evolves from a naive, idealistic young woman into a fully fledged, but deeply conflicted, warrior fighting alongside Xena.{{Or|date=February 2012}}

===The Battling Bard of Potidaea===

Gabrielle starts the series as a young adult who more or less stands behind Xena, and relies on Xena to protect her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sins&quot;/&gt; Later on in the series, she acquires a fighting staff from the Greek [[Amazons]]&lt;ref name=&quot;hooves&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hooves and Harlots|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1995-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starts to use it as both a defensive and offensive weapon, displaying some skill in using the staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;beware Greeks&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series goes on, Gabrielle's skills with the staff continue to develop. In one episode, Gabrielle takes on numerous soldiers and single-handedly attempts to rescue Xena's presumed dead body.&lt;ref name=&quot;greater good&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Greater Good|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two episodes later she is seen blocking an arrow in flight with her staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;death mask&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Death Mask|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Gabrielle also adds kicks and minor [[acrobatics]] to her fighting abilities. Under the tutelage of [[Xena]], she becomes worthy of many foes.

While in [[India]], Gabrielle is thrown through time by a Darsham to save Xena's soul. It is said that [[reincarnation|their souls are together throughout time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;between lines&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Between the Lines|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this next life Xena is the Mother of Peace, Arminestra and Gabrielle is Shakti, a Warrior Prince of [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;between lines&quot;/&gt; At the end of season 4, Gabrielle shows a leap in her warrior abilities. After months of following her path of the Way of Love,&lt;ref name=&quot;the way&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Way|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle picks up the sword of a paralyzed Xena and fights off a large group of Roman soldiers, killing several of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ides of March&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Ides of March|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By season 5, Gabrielle starts to fight with her [[Sai (weapon)|sai]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Chakram&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Chakram|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating more acrobatic abilities, such as performing a wall run and back flip.&lt;ref name=&quot;attraction&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Animal Attraction|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sai and sometimes a new casual staff, she can use a large array of weapons with proficiency. Gabrielle also fights against warriors with notable skill; she defeats the warrior Mavican&lt;ref name=&quot;succession&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Succession|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and stands against Ares and [[Hades]] (two gods) in battle for a period of time, before they defeat her. She also fights in a sword duel with Brutus, [[Caesar_(Xena:_Warrior_Princess)|Caesar's]] former right hand and one of the leaders of Rome, eventually killing him.&lt;ref name=&quot;antony&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Antony and Cleopatra|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle's abilities throughout the series are noticed by the God of War who seeks her out as his new [[protégée]]. It is mentioned later by Gabrielle that Xena trained her throughout the years, although there have only been a few episodes that actually show Xena giving her any sort of martial arts training.   
One of Gabrielle's biggest fights in the series is her fight against fellow Amazon queen, [[Varia (Xena)|Varia]]. They fight in an enclosed arena in a match in which Eve's life is at stake, and they appeared to be at a stand-off before she is beaten by Varia.&lt;ref name=&quot;vengeance&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Path of Vengeance|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2001-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle takes the loss graciously and continues to grow in skill over the remaining season.

==Characterization==
Gabrielle's bardic skills appear to be natural and self-taught.{{or|date=February 2012}} In the opening episode, she displays a remarkable ability to talk her way out of fearsome or difficult situations: she talks a [[cyclops]] out of eating her, and makes an ally of him; talks an old man into giving her a lift; talks a violent crowd out of killing Xena; and talks her way into joining Xena as her traveling partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sins&quot;/&gt;

Besides her persuasive ability, she also reads and writes - rare skills for that time, loves to tell stories, and has some musical ability. As she travels with Xena, she records their adventures on a series of scrolls, with an eye for flair and drama. Occasionally her tendency to exaggerate and glamorize the facts gets her into trouble.&lt;ref name=&quot;quill&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Quill Is Mightier...|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also shown telling stories for money in an inn. In other episodes she wins a place in the Athens City Academy for Performing Bards,&lt;ref name=&quot;athens&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Athens City Academy of the Performing Bards|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a famous playwright, is a theatrical director,&lt;ref name=&quot;play&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Play's The Thing|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays the [[Pan flute|pan pipes]] with considerable skill,&lt;ref name=&quot;prodigal&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Prodigal|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only person able to recite a magical scroll with the correct accents.&lt;ref name=&quot;titans&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Titans|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Gabrielle's ascendancy as a warrior (in the episode &quot;The Ides of March&quot; she slew nine Roman legionaries), her role as a bard remains important. About a year into her travels with Xena, her scrolls about Xena's exploits begin to gain popularity, apparently helping, according to Ares, turn Xena into a legend. After their 25-year sleep, Gabrielle finds out that her stories had been read as far away as North Africa where they were popular among nomad tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Legacy|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an episode set in modern times, Gabrielle's scrolls were preserved for thousands of years and discovered during [[World War II]] by modern archeologists who were descendants of Xena, Gabrielle, and [[Joxer]]. The scrolls found their way to Hollywood, where they formed the basis of the television series. This leads into an entire small story-arc in which the modern-day reincarnations of Xena, Gabrielle and Joxer meet and interact. Xena and Gabrielle's reincarnations pair up to make their own names for themselves, instead of living in their father's shadows. Joxer's reincarnation is a fan of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;scrolls&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Xena Scrolls|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1997-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaetano Bresci''' ({{IPA-it|ɡaeˈtano ˈbreʃʃi}}; November 10, 1869{{spaced ndash}}May 22, 1901) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]] who assassinated King [[Umberto I of Italy]]. Bresci was the first European [[regicide]] offender not to be executed, as [[capital punishment in Italy]] had been abolished since 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, John L., Jr. 2001, September 14.  &quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_39_37/ai_78728719 He executed justice - papal execution Giovanni Battista Bugatti's life and work]&quot;. ''National Catholic Reporter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Militancy==
[[File:Monumento Bresci.jpg|thumb|left|The Gaetano Bresci monument in [[Carrara]].]]
Bresci was born at Coiano, near [[Prato]], [[Tuscany]], and emigrated from Italy to the [[United States]], making his living as a weaver in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], which had a large Italian-American community.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE7D6113BEE33A25752C3A9619C946197D6CF&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22Gaetano+Bresci%22+Paterson&amp;st=p &quot;ASSASSIN'S LOT FELL UPON ANARCHIST HERE; Gaetano Bresci, the King's Murderer, Lived in Paterson. WAS IN AMERICA SIX YEARS His Identity Established, and His Membership in an Italian Anarchistic Group in the New Jersey Town.&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 31, 1900. Accessed May 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He became involved with and later a leading member of an Italian political group called &quot;Gruppo diritti all' esistenza&quot;.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was one of the founders of ''La Questione Sociale'', the [[Italian language]] anarchist paper published in Paterson. According to [[Emma Goldman]]:
{{quote|text=He was a skillful weaver, considered by his employers as a sober, hard-working man, but his pay averaged only fifteen dollars a week. He had a wife and child to support; yet he managed to donate weekly contributions to the paper. He had even saved a hundred and fifty [[United States dollar|dollars]], which he lent to the group at a critical period of ''La Questione Sociale''. His free evenings and Sundays he used to spend in helping with the office work and in [[propaganda]]. He was beloved and respected for his devotion by all the members of his group.}}

In 1898, high bread prices led to demonstrations all over Italy. In [[Milan]], an unarmed crowd of protestors marched toward the [[palace]], which was surrounded by a strong [[Italian Army|military]] force under the command of General [[Fiorenzo Bava-Beccaris]]. The crowd ignored the order to disperse, whereupon Bava-Beccaris gave the signal to fire with muskets and cannons, resulting in a [[Bava-Beccaris massacre|massacre of the demonstrators]], in which more than ninety people died.
[[Image:Gaetano Bresci arrested.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Gaetano Bresci during his trial]]

==Umberto I's killing==
King Umberto later decorated Bava-Beccaris, complimenting him upon his &quot;brave defense of the royal house&quot;&amp;nbsp;— as a result of which Bresci became determined to kill the king. Bresci had his loan to the paper returned (without telling his comrades why), and with the money he went to Italy. In [[Monza]], where the king was visiting on July 29, 1900, he shot him four times with a five-shot [[List of handgun cartridges|.32]] revolver. A monument, the Cappella Espiatoria, has been erected in the exact spot the king was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1900-08-03/ed-1/seq-2/;words=Bresci ''New York Evening World'' (August 3, 1900)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and death==
Bresci was captured and put on [[Trial (law)|trial]], where he was defended by the anarchist [[lawyer]] [[Francesco Saverio Merlino]]. There being no capital punishment in Italy at the time, he was sentenced in Milan on August 29, 1900, to penal servitude for life on [[Santo Stefano Island]] near [[Ventotene]], where numerous other anarchists had also been sent over the years. Less than a year later, on May 22, 1901, he was found dead in prison at the age of 31.&lt;ref name=nyt240501&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9503E6DA1030E132A25757C2A9639C946097D6CF Bresci Commits Suicide; Murderer of King Humbert Hangs Himself in Prison], The New York Times, May 24, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether he committed suicide, as officially announced, or was [[murder]]ed by his guards.

==Legacy==
* The city of [[Carrara]] dedicated a marble monument to Bresci.
* The city of Prato named a street for him in 1976.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6709">'''Gaheris''' {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|h|ɛr|ᵻ|s}} (Old French: Gaheriet or Gaheriez&lt;ref&gt;Spelling varies according to sources and declension.  In the [[Old French]]  ''La Mort le roi Artu'': &quot;Gaheriet&quot; in the [[oblique case]], &quot;Gaheriez&quot; in the [[nominative case]] (Jean Frappier, ed., ''La Mort le roi Artu'', Paris: Droz, 1996, p.291. ISBN 2600001832).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a character in the [[Arthurian legend]], a nephew of [[King Arthur]] and a [[Knight of the Round Table]], the third son of Arthur's sister or half-sister [[Morgause]] and her husband [[Lot (Arthurian legend)|Lot]], King of [[Orkney]] and [[Lothian]]. He is the younger brother of [[Gawain]] and [[Agravaine]], and the older brother of [[Gareth]] and half-brother of [[Mordred]].&lt;ref&gt;An enumeration of the four brothers (excluding Mordred) can be found in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' when Gawain tells the &quot;white-haired queen&quot; (his grandmother [[Igraine]]) the names of the four brothers (&quot;Gawain is the oldest, the second Agravain the Proud [...], Gaheriet and Guerehet are the names of the following two.&quot; (verses 8139-8142 in the Dufournet edition; verses 8056-8060 in the Méla edition)); a brief portrait of the five brothers (including Mordred) can be found in the prose ''Lancelot'' (see: Norris J. Lacy, ed., ''Lancelot-Grail: Lancelot Parts III and IV'', Volume 4 of ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'', Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd, 2010, pp. 392-4. ISBN 9781843842354.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaheris is mentioned in [[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See above.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of his adventures are narrated in the ''[[Lancelot-Grail]]'' cycle.  In the prose ''Lancelot'', he is described as valiant, agile, handsome, reticent in speech, prone to excess when angered, and possessing a right arm longer than the left.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; His death at the hands of [[Lancelot]] (during Lancelot's rescue of the queen from being burned at the stake) is related in the ''Death of Arthur'', the final volume of the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Norris J. Lacy, ed. and trans., ''Lancelot-Grail: The Death of Arthur'', Volume 7 of ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'', Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd, 2010, p. 69-70. ISBN 9780859917704.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Lancelot'' and the ''Death of Arthur'' sections of the ''Lancelot-Grail'' cycle differ in their characterization of Gaheris. In the ''Lancelot'', his younger brother Guerrehet/Gareth is Gawain's most cherished brother; in the ''Death of Arthur'', Gaheris is represented as the most cherished, and his death anguishes Gawain profoundly.&lt;ref&gt;Norris J. Lacy, ed., ''Lancelot-Grail: Lancelot Parts III and IV'', pp. 393-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Gaheris appears in the ''[[Post-Vulgate Cycle]]'' and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', as well as in other media related to the Arthurian legend.

== Gaheris in Malory ==
In [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Gaheris is [[squire]] to his elder brother Gawain, whose fiery temper he helps moderate, before being knighted himself. He participates in the [[revenge killing]] of [[Pellinore|King Pellinore]], his father's slayer, and [[Lamorak|Sir Lamorak]], Pellinore's son and his mother's lover. More notorious is his [[beheading]] of his own mother Morgause after catching her [[in flagrante delicto]] with the youthful and handsome Lamorak, who meanwhile escapes. Lamorak is hunted down by all of the brothers except Gareth, believing him to be their mother's murderer, and Mordred stabs him in the back. Lamorak is greater than any knight except [[Lancelot]] and [[Tristan|Tristram]], so the Orkney brothers' act of revenge is deemed cowardly and a blot on their honour. Arthur and the brothers discover that Gaheris is Morgause's slayer, and he is banished from court.

Despite being exiled, Gaheris appears later in the narrative, when he and his brother Gareth are accidentally killed by [[Lancelot]] during the rescue of [[Guinevere]]. Gaheris and Gareth will have nothing to do with Agravaine and Mordred's plot to entrap Lancelot and Guinevere, and Arthur asks the brothers to help guard the Queen's execution. Gaheris and Gareth reluctantly agree, though Gawain refuses. They decline to wear armor; Lancelot is unable to distinguish friend from foe in his blind wrath, and rushes to save the woman whom he loves. He unintentionally cuts down the unarmored princes. When he is later told what happened, Lancelot is emotionally anguished, because he loved Gareth almost like a son. Gawain's fury at this outrage is terrible and the resulting feud largely destroys the Round Table.

== Analysis ==
Gaheris is often little more than a supporting character to his brothers [[Gawain]] and [[Gareth]], with the murder of Morgause an odd exception{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, leading modern authors such as [[T. H. White]] to attribute the act of matricide to [[Agravaine]] instead. White gives his own individual interpretation to the story, depicting Agravaine as having an unhealthy love/lust obsession for his own mother, and repeatedly describes Gaheris as &quot;dull&quot; or &quot;dull-witted&quot;. Gaheris even marries the sister of Gareth's wife Lyonors, the haughty damsel [[Lynette and Lyonesse|Lynette]]. It is likely that Gaheris and Gareth were the same character in origin{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, as their names in [[French language|French]] sources are easy to confuse (Guerrehet (Gareth, usually) and Gaheriet (Gaheris, usually)), and adventures ascribed to the brothers are often interchangeable. Furthermore, only one brother is ever named for Gwalchmai ap Gwyar, the character from [[Welsh mythology]] traditionally identified with Gawain. This character ([[Gwalchafed]]) is a likely source for Gaheris and Gareth, if Gawain was indeed derived from Gwalchmai.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== In other adaptations==

* In the movie ''[[First Knight]]'' (1995) Gaheris is portrayed by [[Alexis Denisof]].&lt;ref&gt;[[IMDB]], [http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0066846/ &quot;Sir Gaheris (Character)&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Gerald Morris]]' ''[[The Squire's Tales]]'', Gaheris is one of the main heroes, a witty, quietly brave man who prefers agriculture to sword fighting.

==See also==
* Gaheris, the brother of Gawain, should not be confused with a different character in the ''Death of Arthur'', Gaheris of Karaheu (brother of Mador de la Porte), who is killed by eating a poisoned fruit offered to him (unknowingly) by the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Frappier, pp 75-6, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Gaius Baltar''' is a [[fictional character]] in the TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' played by [[James Callis]], a reimagining of [[Count Baltar]] from the 1978 ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Gaius Baltar: Colonialism Reimagined in Battlestar Galactica |title=Breaching the Colonial Contract |publisher=Springer Netherlands |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9944-1 |year=2009 |last1=Kempf |first1=Arlo |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the show's primary characters.

==Personality==

Gaius Baltar regularly uses a well-developed acting talent to spin yarns on virtually any subject when he feels the need. He possesses a dry, cynical sense of humour but is prone to bouts of [[neurosis]]. A [[charisma]]tic genius and womanizer, he is initially portrayed as a self-serving opportunist, but becomes a braver and more caring character over the course of the series, expressing regret for having been &quot;a profoundly selfish man.&quot; Baltar is initially an [[atheist]], but ultimately converts to the Cylons' monotheistic religion. Baltar is described as &quot;weak&quot;, &quot;arrogant&quot; and &quot;a coward&quot; by Lee Adama while Caprica Six describes Baltar as &quot;[[narcissistic]], self-centred, feckless and vain.&quot;

==Character biography==

===Early life===
Gaius Baltar claims to be from the [[colony]] of [[Twelve Colonies|Aerilon]], and that at the age of ten, finding the Aerilonian [[dialect]] to be detrimental to his career dreams, he trained himself to speak the [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprican]] dialect in hopes of one day being considered a citizen of one of the more respected and wealthy colonies such as Caprica. He also has a very troubled relationship with his father.

===The destruction of the Twelve Colonies===
At the onset of the show, he is involved in a sexual relationship with a [[Caprica Six|beautiful blonde woman]]. Believing her to be working for a corporation in the defense industry, and desiring a more permanent relationship with her, he gives her access to the [[classified information|highly classified]] Colonial defense mainframe (an act of [[treason]] punishable by the [[capital punishment|death penalty]]) so her employers can have an advantage in future contract bidding. In exchange for his access to the government mainframe, she helps him design a navigation program used by Colonial warships, covertly creating [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] in the program.&lt;ref name=frak&gt;{{cite book |last=George | first=Susan A. |editor-first=J.P. | editor-last=Telotte |title=The essential science fiction television reader |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |year=2008 |page=165 |chapter=Fraking Machines |isbn=978-0-8131-2492-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFQicvXd5bwC&amp;dq=fraking+machines&amp;q=%22back+doors%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22back%20doors%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Cylons attack the [[Twelve Colonies]], they use those backdoors to penetrate software security [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], disabling entire fighter squadrons outright and sabotaging vital capital-ship systems. On the day the [[Cylon (2003)|Cylons]] attack humanity, the woman reveals she is an advanced Cylon, model Number Six (later known as [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|Caprica Six]]), and she used the information that Baltar gave her to shut down the Colonial defenses, thus making him responsible for the Cylons' successful [[genocide|genocidal]] campaign against the Twelve Colonies. Baltar manages to survive the nuclear explosion that destroys his home due to Caprica Six using her body to shield him.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat090319&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Phillips, Jevon | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/03/battlestar-ga-4.html | title = Battlestar Galactica finale: interview with Ron Moore | date = 2009-03-19 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having unintentionally brought about the near-annihilation of the human species, Baltar flees Caprica when [[Karl Agathon]] gives up his place on a [[Colonial Raptor|Raptor]], feeling that his own life is less important to save than a famed scientist's. The Raptor returns to the [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], where Baltar attempts to endear himself to [[Laura Roslin]], the new President of the remnants of the [[Twelve Colonies]], and hopes to conceal his involvement in the [[genocide]] that has taken place.

===Scientist for the Fleet===

Once a part of the fleet, Baltar is haunted by visions of Number Six, with whom he converses often (cf. [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Head Six|Head Six]]). It is unclear to Baltar whether these projections are from a chip Number Six implanted in his brain while they were together on Caprica (the explanation originally given by the Number Six vision, which she later disclaimed) or if she is simply a manifestation of Baltar's own mind. Although the vision of Number Six manipulates Baltar through his fear of discovery, she lends him an edge by granting him knowledge of situations.  The model of Number Six who had seduced him on Caprica later experiences similar visions after her consciousness was downloaded into a new body. Whereas Baltar experienced visions of her, she experienced visions of him. Both visions acted in similar ways: they were seemingly crueler than the person they were based on and often manipulated the affected party against his or her own species.

Shortly after Baltar comes on board Galactica, Head Six reveals that a device which he had previously seen in possession of Six on Caprica has been surreptitiously installed in Galactica's Combat Information Center (CIC) (the command and control center of the battlestar). Head Six tells him it wasn't her job to put it in there. Baltar realizes there is a Cylon on board Galactica, but knows he cannot reveal that information, or indicate the device is not a part of the ship without implicating himself in the destruction of the Colonies. Baltar decides to implicate a person on board who goes by [[Aaron Doral]] because he is a civilian who has had access to the CIC during the last several weeks and, as an outsider, would be more likely to not be trusted by the Galactica crew. Having already been put in charge of testing the fleet for Cylons, Baltar informs the [[Saul Tigh|Executive Officer]] that he discreetly collected hair samples of crew members and has found Doral is a Cylon. Baltar, however, had no method at the time for testing for Cylons in the fleet. Baltar also explains he saw Doral doing something with a strange-looking device in the CIC he does not recognize. This forces him to develop an actual method for testing the fleet for Cylons, having already &quot;demonstrated&quot; an ability to do so. The process he eventually creates is reliable and is done through the testing of blood samples, but is time consuming (it takes 11 hours to test one person).

In the episode &quot;[[Six Degrees of Separation (Battlestar Galactica)|Six Degrees of Separation]]&quot;, Baltar is accused of being a traitor to the human race when a flesh-and-blood Number Six (after Baltar and Head Six have a heated argument over whether or not God exists) produces photographic evidence showing that Baltar carried an explosive device into the Colonial Defense Mainframe on Caprica, allowing the Cylons to carry out their nuclear attack. When it is found the evidence is fake, President Roslin holds a press conference publicly exonerating Baltar. Head Six tells him his public position is now stronger than ever since he has been accused of a serious crime and found innocent, and even possibly been the target of a Cylon plot. Meanwhile, the real-life Six disappears from ''Galactica'' and is nowhere to be found.

In the episode &quot;The Hand of God&quot;, Baltar successfully helps the fleet destroy a Cylon mining base on an asteroid with badly needed [[tylium]] ores for fueling the fleet. The planners of the attack ask Baltar to point out where the best target for a bomb run is on a recon photo, even though he has no idea what it looks like. In his mind, Baltar asks Head Six for help, but she tells him it is in God's hands and He will 'tell' Baltar where to point. Baltar then points to one of the buildings of the base, simply as a wild guess. Much to Baltar's surprise, his guess was correct. Baltar comes to believe the only logical explanation is that God guided his hand.

===Vice-Presidency===

In the episode &quot;[[Colonial Day (Battlestar Galactica)|Colonial Day]]&quot;, Baltar, now Caprica's representative to the Quorum of Twelve, is elected Vice-President with Roslin's support. In the episode &quot;[[Home (Battlestar Galactica)|Home, Part II]]&quot;, Baltar undergoes a brain scan which reveals no sign of a computer chip. He realizes his vision of Number Six  could not be a hallucination, as she is aware of facts he could not possibly know.  She tells him the first Human/Cylon Hybrid will be born in the ship's brig; soon, the Caprican version of the Cylon [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon Valerii]] (pregnant with the human Karl Agathon's child) is imprisoned in it. When Baltar confronts Six with this, she simply replies she is &quot;an angel of God sent here to protect you, to guide you, and to love you&quot;. Head Six later persuades Baltar to give a pacifist movement a nuclear bomb Admiral [[William Adama]] had given him in an earlier episode for use in constructing a Cylon detector.

Baltar proceeds to run for President against Roslin. He is far behind Roslin in the polls when a [[habitable planet]] is accidentally discovered in a region of space where heavy electromagnetic interference makes long-range observation difficult. Baltar announces that he will begin immediate civilian settlement of [[New Caprica]] if elected. Due to his support for settlement of New Caprica, the election promptly swings in Baltar's favor and he is sworn in as president. During the inauguration itself, the nuclear warhead Baltar gave up destroys a luxury liner. Following this apparent act of Cylon terrorism, Admiral Adama urges Baltar to focus immediately on internal security and investigate how a Cylon agent could have carried out the bombing. Baltar refuses, however, and proceeds with plans for settlement.

===Presidency===

After one year, life on New Caprica is extremely difficult, with the civilian population living in rough conditions and shortages of basic supplies like antibiotics persisting. A Cylon fleet arrives in orbit of New Caprica and the remaining military fleet jumps away. A Cylon delegation accepts Baltar's surrender. When Baltar asks how the Cylons managed to detect New Caprica, it is revealed they were a light-year away when they detected the light and radiation from the nuclear explosion Gina set off the year before. Baltar continues to hold the office of the Presidency, but only as a figurehead. Compounding his alienation to his people, he was forced at gunpoint to sign an execution order for hundreds of humans. However, throughout the occupation of New Caprica, Baltar tried to persuade the Cylons their mission to rule over the human race could not succeed and they should leave the planet. When the Colonials evacuate New Caprica, Baltar and Caprica-Six discover [[Hera (Cylon-Human)|Hera]], the child of Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; Agathon whom Head Six predicted would be born in ''Galactica's'' Brig. Baltar's rescue of the child helps him convince the Cylons to make him a member of their fleet.

===Life among the Cylons===

In the episode &quot;[[Collaborators (Battlestar Galactica)|Collaborators]]&quot;, we find Baltar living on a Cylon Basestar in a barless cell. Caprica-Six informs Baltar she has had a change of heart about him and has let her feelings for him cloud her judgment, presumably ending their relationship. However, by the end of the episode, it is indicated she has cast the tie-breaking vote amongst the Cylons to allow Baltar to remain alive aboard the Cylon Basestar, though it is clear they remain estranged. Over time, Baltar becomes accustomed to his new environment. Once Baltar learns that no one knows what the &quot;Final Five&quot; Cylons look like, he begins to suspect that he himself may be a Cylon. He admits however that this is wishful thinking on his part, because of his desire to have all his 'sins' forgiven and become a hero to another people.

Towards the end of Baltar's stay with the Cylons, he grows much closer to D'Anna, who has become obsessed with finding the identities of the &quot;Final Five&quot; Cylons. Pondering if he himself is a Cylon, Baltar brushes Caprica-Six aside and aligns with D'Anna. Together, in the episodes &quot;[[The Eye of Jupiter (Battlestar Galactica)|Eye of Jupiter]]&quot; and &quot;[[Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)|Rapture]]&quot;, Baltar and the Three models defy the other Cylon models and he and D'Anna travel to the surface of an algae planet in search for an ancient ruined temple. Three believed the temple would show her the identities of the Final Five. D'Anna appears to see the Final Five, but collapses and swiftly dies before she can tell Baltar if he is a Cylon or not. Hoping to retrigger the vision, Baltar steps onto the platform D'Anna used, when Chief Tyrol gets the drop on Baltar and knocks him out. The ex-president is then transported back to ''Galactica'' in a body bag and sent to the brig.

===Trial===
Baltar is subjected to a hallucinogen-based interrogation by Admiral Adama about any involvement with the Cylons. Baltar admits his unwitting complicity in the original Cylon attack on the Colonies, though without any specifics. Meanwhile, Baltar smuggles writings out of his cell through his lawyer, which are published in a memoir, ''My Triumphs, My Mistakes.'' In the book, Baltar attempts to explain his actions as President to the public and foment class warfare by describing the fleet as a bifurcated society, accusing the elite upper class of militarism and professional civilians of exploiting the less well-educated working class. While the book is not completed at the end of Season 3 (President Roslin confiscates several sections through repeated searches of Baltar's cell), it becomes very popular among certain segments of the fleet populace (despite Roslin's repeated attempts to suppress its distribution), including workers on the tylium refinery ship and Chief Tyrol's flight-deck maintenance crew, as well as his wife [[Cally Tyrol]]. Despite the labor difficulties Baltar experienced with Tyrol on New Caprica, the book's popularity leads to Tyrol calling a general strike and exacerbates the fleet's already strained social order.

As his trial proceeds, Baltar's first lawyer is killed in an explosion aboard a sabotaged Raptor. His second attorney, [[Romo Lampkin]], survives a similar attempt on his life. [[Lee Adama]] (now Lampkin's security adjutant) then joins Baltar's defense team. The trial is unfair, and includes witness [[Felix Gaeta]] deliberately lying to ensure a guilty verdict. Baltar rejects his defense team's suggestion to demand a mistrial saying, &quot;there will be a verdict&quot;. The defense team uses the very end of the trial to try to persuade the jury that Baltar is guilty only of being a [[scapegoat]] for the Cylon occupation. Lee Adama also mentions the fleet has forgiven numerous other persons for their mistakes because they have had to in order to ensure their survival. Baltar is found not guilty for his crimes by a 3-2 vote, with Admiral Adama casting a vote in Baltar's favor. Roslin is disgusted Baltar is now free as she still truly believes he was involved in sabotaging the colonial defenses in the attack. After Baltar is freed from prison, his defense team abandons him.

===Return to civilian life===
Shortly before the Cylon fleet attacks at the Ionian Nebula, Baltar is led away to safety by three female followers of his work, one of whom had asked him to bless her sick child before his trial. He is received warmly by a group (with mostly female members) that has erected a shrine to him in an unused compartment of ''Galactica''. Baltar quickly learns he has no other place to go, and must stay on the ship. Under the direction of his Virtual Six, Baltar spreads Monotheistic beliefs among the group. After his following on ''Galactica'' is attacked by a [[polytheism]] group, Baltar (with the encouragement of his Virtual Six) disrupts a religious ceremony of one of the polytheist denominations in the fleet. Later, President Roslin meets with the imprisoned Baltar to pressure him to avoid stirring up more trouble in the future. After he is released, Baltar is prevented from returning to his home by government soldiers acting under new legislation approved by the President. The legislation restricts the right to assembly specifically for Baltar's movement. Under the direction of Virtual Six, Baltar keeps attempting to re-enter his home, and is subjected to repeated blows from a ''Galactica'' marine. Virtual Six is shown physically lifting Baltar from the floor to a standing position; whereby camera pans across a couple views to allude to Baltar's view of the action and then the view of this action in the context of everyone else present. While we see Baltar's perspective, everyone else only sees a limp Baltar rising to a vertical posture. Their facial expressions appear to allude some sort of supernatural experience is occurring. This continues until Lee Adama arrives to inform Baltar the Quorum of Twelve has overruled the President and revoked the new legislation. Baltar goes on to preach God loves all humans regardless of their sin because everyone is perfect just as they are. Baltar then begins illegal wireless broadcasts to the fleet of his religious speeches and his popularity grows.

Shortly thereafter, Kara Thrace informs the once again cancer-stricken President Roslin the Cylon Hybrid on the captured rebel Cylon Basestar referred to a &quot;dying leader&quot; learning the &quot;truth of the opera house&quot;—the setting of the dreams Roslin shares with Caprica-Six and Athena. As Baltar's popularity continues to increase, he chooses to inform the fleet of Roslin sharing her visions with both of the long-time Cylons in the fleet. Although this development distressed Roslin, she decides to bring Baltar with her (along with Karl Agathon—Athena's husband) to the Cylon Basestar to see the Hybrid. She informs Baltar that she chose to do this because she sees him in the dreams she shares with Caprica-Six and Athena. The Basestar jumps away from the fleet the moment the Hybrid is reactivated to begin a series of jumps to reach the Cylon Resurrection Hub, leaving Baltar once again away from the fleet aboard a Cylon ship. When the Basestar jumps away from the Colonial Fleet, Roslin begins to have a series of visions involving Elosha, a deceased priestess. Baltar and Roslin attempt to interrogate the Hybrid. Later, during an attack on the Cylon Resurrection Hub, Baltar is injured. After he is influenced by morpha administered by Roslin, Baltar reveals the details of his involvement in the attack on the Colonies. Roslin decides to leave Baltar's injuries untreated, letting him bleed to death. At that moment, the Basestar jumps again and Roslin's continuing vision of Elosha on ''Galactica'' culminates in an extended discourse on the need to respect the rights of the living. Afterwards, Roslin tries desperately to save Baltar's life. Baltar recovers and is then reunited with D'Anna. Later, Baltar thanks Roslin for choosing not to murder him.

===Cooperation with Colonial government===
Following the discovery of a devastated planet Earth and Admiral Adama's support for a permanent alliance with the rebel Cylons, Zarek and Felix Gaeta lead an unsuccessful mutiny on ''Galactica''. During the mutiny, President Roslin goes to Baltar to ask if she can use his wireless transmitter to speak to the fleet and urge them to support the government. After Roslin speaks to the fleet, she and Baltar flee to the rebel Baseship while they wait out the conflict. After order is restored on ''Galactica'', Baltar returns to his following to find its numbers dwindled and are now under the de facto leadership of Paula (although some appear to still be more loyal to Baltar). During the mutiny, the Monotheists were brutalized by mutineers. Afterward, the Monotheists comb the ship for weapons and food to hoard. Baltar attempts reclaiming leadership when the Monotheists take him to Dogsville. Baltar insists to his followers they give away all their food. However, the group which had attacked Baltar's followers arrives armed with weapons and steal the remaining food. Virtual Six insists Baltar attempt to persuade his followers there is a way to feed themselves and everyone else on the ship. After Baltar wins over everyone except Paula, Virtual Six tells him &quot;We can get guns.&quot; Baltar then promises his following that he will acquire numerous advanced firearms.

Baltar attempts to acquire weapons from Admiral Adama. He does this by arguing that ''Galactica'' is slowly slipping away from Adama and then eventually he will either maintain order by giving civilians weapons or bringing Cylon Centurions to the ship. Insisting that the fleet would not accept Centurions on ''Galactica'', Baltar is able to barely persuade Adama to agree his religious group is the only viable option for maintaining order. The Monotheists are then armed by the Colonial government, cementing Baltar's leadership of the group.

===Arrival at Earth===

When the last Raptor leaves ''Galactica'' with Paula, Baltar decides not to go and stays on Galactica to finally do something noble. Baltar is issued a rifle and is assigned as part of ''Galactica's'' reserve force alongside Caprica Six. The [[&quot;Head Baltar&quot;|virtual Baltar]] only seen by Caprica Six and the virtual Six seen only by Baltar then appear to them and they both realize they can both see both of them. During the assault on the Cylon colony ship, Baltar and Caprica Six defend ''Galactica'' from Cylon Centurions: Baltar performs well, taking down at least one Centurion, but in a bout of over-enthusiasm nearly shoots the returning rescue team before he is stopped by Caprica Six. The two later find Hera who is running away in a manner that fulfills the Opera House vision (with ''Galactica'' substituted for the Opera House). They carry her through the ship to the Opera House and enter it to find themselves in ''Galactica's'' CIC with the Final Five in similar positions as they were in the vision. Cavil takes Hera hostage, but Baltar tries to talk him down attempting to convince him to end the cycle of violence. Cavil starts to falter and finally gives in when Colonel Tigh offers him resurrection in return for Hera and leaving humanity alone for good.  

Planetside, he's part of the survey crew that discovers a primitive version of humanity which evolved on the planet (and which the Colonials later name Earth) and says they're compatible for the Colonials and the humanoid Cylons to breed with. 

Baltar decides to make a life as a farmer with Caprica Six and chokes up when he mentions that he knows about farming as he apparently remembers his father. 

Later, while observing Hera with Caprica Six, Baltar and Caprica Six receive a final visit from their ethereal counterparts. They reveal Baltar and Caprica have fulfilled their role in God's plan. Afterward, the ethereal Beings disappear for the last time, then appear in modern-day earth 150,000 years later.

==&quot;Head Baltar&quot;==
Mirroring Gaius Baltar's &quot;Head Six&quot;, Caprica Six sees and interacts with a vision of Gaius Baltar (also portrayed by Callis).

'''Gaius Cassius Longinus''' ({{IPA-la|ˈgaː.i.ʊs ˈkas.si.ʊs ˈlɔŋ.gɪ.nʊs|classical}}; October 3, before 85 BC – October 3, 42&amp;nbsp;BC) was a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[Roman Senate|senator]], a leading instigator of the plot to [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|kill]] [[Julius Caesar]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], ''The Roman Revolution'' (Oxford University Press, 1939, reprinted 2002), p. 57 [https://books.google.com/books?id=LliyGzhAo1wC&amp;pg=PA57 online]; [[Elizabeth Rawson]], &quot;Caesar: Civil War and Dictatorship,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The Last Age of the Roman Republic 146–43 BC'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), vol. 9, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html|title=Life of Caesar|last=Plutarch|first=|date=|website=University of Chicago|publisher=|page=595|access-date=|quote=...at this juncture Decimus Brutus, surnamed Albinus, who was so trusted by Caesar that he was entered in his will as his second heir, but was partner in the conspiracy of the other Brutus and Cassius, fearing that if Caesar should elude that day, their undertaking would become known, ridiculed the seers and chided Caesar for laying himself open to malicious charges on the part of the senators...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html|title=De Vita Caesarum|last=Suetonius|first=|date=121|website=University of Chicago|publisher=|page=107|trans-title=The Twelve Casesars|access-date=|quote=More than sixty joined the conspiracy against [Caesar], led by Gaius Cassius and Marcus and Decimus Brutus.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the brother in-law of [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]. He commanded troops with Brutus during the [[Battle of Philippi]] against the combined forces of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Augustus|Octavian]], Caesar's former supporters, and committed suicide after being defeated by Mark Antony.

He was elected Tribune of the Plebs in 49 B.C. He opposed Caesar, and he commanded a fleet against him during [[Caesar's Civil War]]: after Caesar defeated [[Pompey]] in the Battle of Pharsalus, Caesar overtook Cassius and forced him to surrender. After Caesar's death, Cassius fled to the East, where he amassed an army of twelve legions. He was supported and made Governor by the Senate. Though he and Brutus marched west against the allies of the [[Second Triumvirate]], Cassius was defeated at the Battle of Phillippi and committed suicide. 

He followed the teachings of the philosopher [[Epicurus]], although scholars debate whether or not these beliefs affected his political life. Cassius is a main character in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' that depicts the assassination of Caesar and its aftermath. He is also shown in the lowest circle of [[Hell]] in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|The Inferno]]'' as punishment for killing Caesar.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Biography==
===Early life===
Little is known of Gaius Cassius' early life, apart from a story that he showed his dislike of despots while still at school, by quarreling with the son of the dictator [[Sulla]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Brutus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#9 9.1-4]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied philosophy at [[Rhodes]] under [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]] and became fluent in [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/4*.html#67 4.67].&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to [[Junia Tertia]] (Tertulla), who was the daughter of [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] and thus a half-sister of his co-conspirator [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]]. They had one son, who was born in about 60 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Brutus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#14 14.4]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 53 BC he took part in the [[Battle of Carrhae]] lost by [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] against the [[Parthia]]ns.

===Civil war===
Cassius returned to Rome in 50 BC, when [[Caesar's civil war|civil war]] was about to break out between [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]]. Cassius was elected [[tribune of the Plebs]] for 49&amp;nbsp;BC, and threw in his lot with the [[Optimates]], although his brother [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (proconsul)|Lucius Cassius]] supported Caesar. Cassius left Italy shortly after Caesar crossed the [[Rubicon]]. He met Pompey in [[Greece]], and was appointed to command part of his fleet.

In 48 BC, Cassius sailed his ships to [[Sicily]], where he attacked and burned a large part of Caesar's navy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], ''Civil War'', [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Caesar/CaesarCiv03.html#caes.civ.3.101 iii.101].&lt;/ref&gt; He then proceeded to harass ships off the [[Italy|Italian]] coast. News of Pompey's defeat at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] caused Cassius to head for the [[Hellespont]], with hopes of allying with the king of [[Pontus]], [[Pharnaces II of Pontus|Pharnaces&amp;nbsp;II]]. Cassius was overtaken by Caesar en route, and was forced to surrender unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;However, [[Suetonius]] (''Caesar'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#63 63]) says that it was Lucius Cassius who surrendered to Caesar at the Hellespont.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar made Cassius a [[legatus|legate]], employing him in the [[Alexandrian War]] against the very same Pharnaces whom Cassius had hoped to join after Pompey's defeat at Pharsalus. However, Cassius refused to join in the fight against [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and [[Metellus Scipio|Scipio]] in [[Africa]], choosing instead to retire to Rome.

===Conspiracy===
{{main article|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}

Cassius spent the next two years in office, and apparently tightened his friendship with [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;In a letter written in 45 BC, Cassius says to Cicero, &quot;There is nothing that gives me more pleasure to do than to write to you; for I seem to be talking and joking with you face to face&quot; ([http://www.attalus.org/translate/cassius.html#15.19 ''Ad Fam.'', xv.19]).&lt;/ref&gt; In 44 BC, he became ''[[praetor peregrinus]]'' with the promise of the [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]n province for the ensuing year. The appointment of his junior and brother-in-law, [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Brutus]], as [[Praetor#Praetor urbanus|''praetor urbanus'']] deeply offended him.

Although Cassius was &quot;the moving spirit&quot; in the plot against Caesar, winning over the chief assassins to the cause of [[tyrannicide]], Brutus became their leader.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.R.S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 320, citing Plutarch, ''Brutus'' 7.1–3 and ''Caesar'' 62.2; and Appian, ''Bellum Civile'' 4.57.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Ides of March]], 44 BC, Cassius urged on his fellow liberators and struck Caesar in the chest area. Though they succeeded in assassinating Caesar, the celebration was short-lived, as [[Mark Antony]] seized power and turned the public against them. In letters written during 44 BC, Cicero frequently complains that Rome was still subjected to tyranny, because the &quot;Liberators&quot; had failed to kill Antony.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Cicero]], ''Ad Fam.'', [http://www.attalus.org/translate/cassius.html#12.3 xii.3.1].&lt;/ref&gt; According to some accounts, Cassius had wanted to kill Antony at the same time as Caesar, but Brutus dissuaded him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Velleius Paterculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#58 2.58.5]; [[Plutarch]], ''Brutus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#18 18.2-6].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-assassination===
Cassius' reputation in the East made it easy to amass an army from other governors in the area, and by 43 BC he was ready to take on [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella]] with 12 [[Roman legion|legions]]. By this point the Senate had split with Antonius and cast its lot with Cassius, confirming him as governor of the province. Dolabella attacked but was betrayed by his allies, leading him to commit [[suicide]]. Cassius was now secure enough to march on [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], but on the formation of the [[Second Triumvirate]], Brutus requested his assistance. Cassius quickly joined Brutus in [[Smyrna]] with most of his army, leaving his nephew behind to govern Syria.

The conspirators decided to attack the triumvirate’s allies in [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. Cassius set upon and sacked [[Rhodes]], while Brutus did the same to [[Lycia]]. They regrouped the following year in [[Sardis]], where their armies proclaimed them [[imperator]]. They crossed the [[Hellespont]], marched through [[Thrace]], and encamped near [[Philippi]] in [[Macedon]]. Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian (later known as [[Augustus]]) and Mark Antony soon arrived, and Cassius planned to starve them out through the use of their superior position in the country. However, they were forced into a pair of battles by Antony, collectively known as the [[Battle of Philippi]]. Brutus was successful against Octavian, and took his camp. Cassius, however, was defeated and overrun by Antony. Cassius, unaware of Brutus' victory, gave up all for lost, and killed himself with the very same dagger he used against Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;PLutarch, Fall of the Roman Republic, sec. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of Cassius' death is the same as that of his birth, October 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Roy A.|last2=Adkins|first2=Lesley|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JJdqJ8YGH8C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=August 7, 2009|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-512332-6|page=14|chapter=Republic and Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was mourned by Brutus as &quot;the Last of the Romans&quot; and buried in [[Thasos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Brutus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#44 44.2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epicureanism==
&quot;Among that select band of philosophers who have managed to change the world,&quot; writes [[David Sedley]], &quot;it would be hard to find a pair with a higher public profile than Brutus and Cassius — brothers-in-law, fellow-assassins, and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearian]] heroes,&quot; adding that &quot;it may not even be widely known that they ''were'' philosophers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sedley]], &quot;The [[Ethics]] of Brutus and Cassius,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 87 (1997) 41–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Brutus, whose [[Stoicism|Stoic]] proclivities are widely assumed but who is more accurately described as an [[Antiochus of Ascalon|Antiochean Platonist]], Cassius exercised a long and serious interest in philosophy. His early philosophical commitments are hazy, though [[D.R. Shackleton Bailey]] thought that a remark by Cicero&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ad familiares'' [http://www.attalus.org/translate/cassius.html#15.16 xv.16.3].&lt;/ref&gt; indicates a youthful adherence to the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;As cited by Miriam Griffin, &quot;Philosophy, Politics, and Politicians at Rome,&quot; in ''Philosophia togata: Essays on Philosophy and Roman Society'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime between 48 and 45 BC, however, Cassius famously converted to the school of thought founded by [[Epicurus]]. Although Epicurus advocated a withdrawal from politics, at Rome his philosophy was made to accommodate the careers of many prominent men in public life, among them Caesar's father-in-law, [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]].&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of Roman Epicureans active in politics, see [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], review of ''Science and Politics in the Ancient World'' by Benjamin Farrington (London 1939), in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 31 (1941), pp. 151–157.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] called Cassius' conversion a &quot;conspicuous date in the history of Roman [[Epicureanism]],&quot; a choice made not to enjoy the pleasures of the [[Epicureanism#History|Garden]], but to provide a philosophical justification for assassinating a tyrant.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 31 (1941), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero associates Cassius's new Epicureanism with a willingness to seek peace in the aftermath of the [[Caesar's civil war|civil war between Caesar and Pompeius]].&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Griffin, &quot;The Intellectual Developments of the Ciceronian Age,&quot; in ''The Cambridge Ancient History'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 726 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yUkzNLiY4oC&amp;pg=PA726&amp;dq=%22Cassius%27+conversion%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miriam Griffin]] dates his conversion to as early as 48 BC, after he had fought on the side of Pompeius at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] but decided to come home instead of joining the last holdouts of the [[civil war]] in [[Africa Province|Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spe pacis et odio civilis sanguinis'' (&quot;with a hope of peace and a hatred of shedding blood in civil war&quot;), Cicero, ''Ad fam''. [http://www.attalus.org/translate/cassius.html#15.15 xv.15.1]; Miriam Griffin, &quot;Philosophy, Politics, and Politicians at Rome,&quot; in ''Philosophia togata'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Momigliano placed it in 46 BC, based on a letter by Cicero to Cassius dated January 45.&lt;ref&gt;For a quotation of the Epicurean passage in this letter, see article on the philosopher [[Catius#Sources|Catius]].&lt;/ref&gt; Shackleton Bailey points to a date of two or three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[[D.R. Shackleton Bailey]], ''Cicero Epistulae ad familiares'', vol. 2 (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 378 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fp487vO6Hs4C&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=%22Cassius%27+conversion%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online], in a note to one of Cicero's letters to Cassius (''Ad fam''. [http://www.attalus.org/translate/cassius.html#15.17 xv.17.4]), pointing to evidence he believed Momigliano had overlooked.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dating bears on, but is not essential to, the question of whether Cassius justified the murder of Caesar on Epicurean grounds. Griffin argues that his intellectual pursuits, like those of other Romans, may be entirely removed from any practical application in the realm of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Griffin, &quot;Philosophy, Politics, and Politicians at Rome,&quot; in ''Philosophia togata'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), particularly citing [[Plutarch]], ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#66 66.2] on a lack of philosophical justification for killing Caesar: Cassius is said to commit the act despite his devotion to Epicurus.&lt;/ref&gt; Romans of the Late Republic who can be identified as Epicureans are more often found among the supporters of Caesar, and often literally in his camp. Momigliano argued, however, that many of those who opposed Caesar's dictatorship bore no personal animus toward him, and [[Republicanism]] was more congenial to the Epicurean way of life than [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]]. The Roman concept of ''[[libertas]]'' had been integrated into [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophical studies]], and though Epicurus' theory of the political governance admitted various forms of government based on consent, including but not limited to [[democracy]], a tyrannical state was regarded by Roman Epicureans as incompatible with the [[Summum bonum|highest good]] of pleasure, defined as freedom from pain. Tyranny also threatened the Epicurean value of ''[[parrhesia]]'' (παρρησία), &quot;truthful speaking,&quot; ( and the movement toward [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deifying]] Caesar offended Epicurean belief in abstract gods who lead an ideal existence removed from mortal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Momigliano, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 31 (1941), pp. 151–157. Summary of Cassius's Epicureanism also in David Sedley, &quot;The Ethics of Brutus and Cassius,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 87 (1997), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Momigliano saw Cassius as moving from an initial Epicurean orthodoxy, which emphasized disinterest in matters not of vice and virtue, and [[ataraxia|detachment]], to a &quot;heroic Epicureanism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Momigliano, 1941 p. 157&quot;&gt;Momigliano, ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 31 (1941), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; For Cassius, virtue was active. In a letter to Cicero, he wrote:

{{cquote|I hope that people will understand that for all, cruelty exists in proportion to hatred, and goodness and clemency in proportion to love, and evil men most seek out and crave the things which accrue to good men. It's hard to persuade people that ‘the good is desirable for its own sake'; but it's both true and creditable that pleasure and tranquility are obtained by virtue, justice, and the good. Epicurus himself, from whom all your [[Catius|Catii]] and [[Amafinius|Amafinii]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Catius]] and [[Amafinius]] were Epicurean philosophers known for their popularizing approach and criticized by Cicero for their dumbed-down [[prose]] style.&lt;/ref&gt; take their leave as poor interpreters of his words, says ‘there is no living pleasantly without living a good and just life.'&lt;ref&gt;''Ad familiares'' [http://www.attalus.org/translate/cassius.html#15.19 xv.19]; Shackleton Bailey's Latin text of this letter is available [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fp487vO6Hs4C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22Non+mehercule+in+hac+mea+peregrinatione%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sedley agrees that the conversion of Cassius should be dated to 48, when Cassius stopped resisting Caesar, and finds it unlikely that Epicureanism was a sufficient or primary motivation for his later decision to take violent action against the dictator. Rather, Cassius would have had to reconcile his intention with his philosophical views. Cicero provides evidence&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De republica'' 1.10.&lt;/ref&gt; that Epicureans recognized circumstances when direct action was justified in a political crisis. In the quotation above, Cassius explicitly rejects the idea that morality is a good to be chosen for its own sake; morality, as a means of achieving pleasure and ''[[ataraxia]]'', is not inherently superior to the removal of political anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;David Sedley, &quot;The Ethics of Brutus and Cassius,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 87 (1997), pp. 41 and 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inconsistencies between traditional Epicureanism and an active approach to securing freedom ultimately could not be resolved, and during the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], the philosophy of political opposition tended to be Stoic. This circumstance, Momigliano argues, helps explain why historians of the Imperial era found Cassius more difficult to understand than Brutus, and less admirable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Momigliano, 1941 p. 157&quot;/&gt;

==In literature==
In [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' (Canto XXXIV), Cassius is one of three people deemed [[sin]]ful enough to be chewed in one of the three mouths of [[Satan]], in the very center of [[Hell]], for all eternity, as a punishment for killing [[Julius Caesar]]. The other two are [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], his fellow conspirator, and [[Judas Iscariot]], the [[Bible|Biblical]] betrayer of [[Jesus]].

Cassius also plays a major role in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (I. ii. 190–195) as the leader of the conspiracy to assassinate Caesar. Caesar distrusts him, and states, &quot;Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look; He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.&quot; In one of the final scenes of the play, Cassius mentions to one of his subordinates that the day, October 3, is his birthday, and dies shortly afterwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4635">'''Gaius Cassius Parmensis''' (born c. 74 BC; died 31 or 30 BC in [[Athens]]) was a Roman politician and a Latin writer of the late [[Roman Republic]], who belonged to the circle of conspirators against [[Gaius Julius Caesar]].

Cassius Parmensis came from that branch of the Roman ''gens'' [[Cassia, Rome|Cassia]], that played an important role in the founding of the city of Parma on the Via Aemilia in the second century BC. The ancient commentaries of [[Horace]] note that he was a follower of the teachings of [[Epicurus]].

In the spring of 44 BC Cassius Parmensis participated in the assassination of Caesar by members of the Senate. In 43 BC, following the murder, he became a ''quaestor'' and built a fleet which supported [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] against [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella]] off the coast of the province of Asia. At the same time he wrote a report to [[Cicero]] from Cyprus on the situation, which has been handed down in the latter's correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' 12.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In November of 43 Cassius Parmensis, like many other enemies of Caesar, was declared an outlaw (proscribed) by the triumvirate of [[Mark Antony]], [[Octavian]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]]. After the defeat of the party of the murderers of Caesar in the [[Battle of Philippi]] (autumn of 42 BC), he gathered the remaining military units and was able to bring himself and the undamaged fleet to safety for a while with [[Sextus Pompeius]] in Sicily. After the latter's defeat in the year 36 BC, he accompanied the fallen &quot;naval king&quot; to Asia Minor, in order to join Anthony during the final battles in Bithynia.

Anthony and Octavian waged a propaganda attack with in part low blows and slanders which preceded the decisive military confrontation for autocratic rule in the Roman Empire. Cassius also took part with intense violent attacks against Caesar's heirs. He asserted that Octavian was of low descent,&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and was only named his heir due to a homosexual relationship with Caesar. Furthermore, he said that Octavian had wanted to make his only daughter Julia the consort of the rich but &quot;barbarous&quot; nobleman Koson of Dacia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]], ''Cleopatra'', 1998, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

In 31 BC, Cassius Parmensis fought under Anthony's command at the [[Battle of Actium]]. His flight from Octavian's revenge lasted a total of twelve years (which was longer than that of all the other conspirators) but after the fall of Anthony he finally lost every possibility of fleeing, since the adopted son of Caesar now ruled the entire Roman Empire. After the defeat at Actium, he fled to Athens, where, in 30 B.C. at the very latest, he was recognized as the last murderer of Caesar still living and was killed by Lucius Varus under Octavian's orders.

As an author, Cassius Parmensis wrote tragedies, satires, elegies and epigrams, which, in Horace's opinion, were not insignificant. Unfortunately, none of his work has survived. We only know the titles of two tragedies, ''Thyestes'' and ''Brutus,'' the first of which was allegedly stolen by his murderer Varus. ''Thyestes'' was subsequently published as Varus's own work. The style of his letter to Cicero seems above all complicated and pedantic in its flatteries, but also demonstrates a good talent for military observation. As for the common assertion often referring to another location in Horace, that Cassius had been burned to death together with his works, it is probably a mix-up.

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] quotes a verse of Cassius;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Terentius Varro, ''On the Latin Language'' 7.72.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the same verse is also attributed in another place to the poet [[Lucius Accius]]:&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Terentius Varro, ''On the Latin Language'' 6.7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galactus''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Formerly a mortal man, Galactus is a [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] who originally consumed planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the [[Earth-616|primary Marvel continuity]]. Galactus was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in the comic book ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48, published in March 1966.

Lee and Kirby had desired to introduce a character that broke away from the archetype of the standard villain, culminating in the creation of Galactus. In the character's first appearance in ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'', Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure who feeds by draining living planets of their energy, and operates without regard to the morality and judgements of mortal beings. Galactus' initial origin was that of a space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] further developed the origin of the character, revealing that Galan lived during the previous universe. As Galan's universe came to an end, Galan merged with the &quot;[[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]&quot; to become Galactus, an entity that wielded such cosmic power as to require devouring entire planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Jim Starlin]], and [[Louise Simonson]] explored Galactus' role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the actions of the character through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the [[Silver Surfer]]), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity.

The character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as [[arcade game]]s, [[video game]]s, animated television series, and the 2007 film ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.

===Origin===
{{Main article|The Galactus Trilogy}}
In 1966, nearly five years after launching [[Marvel Comics]]' flagship [[superhero]] title, ''Fantastic Four'', creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the [[supervillain]] mold of the time with god-like stature and power.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirbycollector1&quot; /&gt; As Lee recalled in 1993,
{{quote|Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. Having dreamed up [many] powerful baddies ... we felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of demi-god, but now what would we do with him. We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. ... That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god would be beyond mere good and evil. ... [What] he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets!&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Stan. &quot;Introduction&quot; (second page, unnumbered) 1993, ''Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 5''&lt;!--as spelled in copyright indicia--&gt; (Marvel Publishing : second edition, second printing, 2007) ISBN 978-0-7851-1184-9&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!--Wiki MOS is to use blockquotes for quotes four lines or longer--&gt;
Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the [[Silver Surfer]]:
{{quote|My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales. And I had to come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. ...I had to get something new. And ... for some reason, I went to the Bible. And I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well, because I always felt him, and I certainly couldn't treat him the same way that I would any ordinary mortal ... and of course the Silver Surfer is the fallen angel. ...[T]hey were figures that have never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures, and of course, they were the first gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Kirby elaborated, &quot;Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert. [http://www.reocities.com/brenni_au/JackKirby.html &quot;The King&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007232709/http://www.reocities.com/brenni_au/JackKirby.html |date=7 October 2010 }}, ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #36, August 1994, via Brenni_Au/JackKirby (fan site). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708024127/http://www.reocities.com/brenni_au/JackKirby.html |date=8 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation: &quot;In five short years from the launch of the ''Fantastic Four'', the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the [[Skrull]]s, the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins &amp; Brown, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to the introduction of Galactus in ''Fantastic Four'' #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling &quot;[[The Galactus Trilogy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kirbycollector1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fein |first=Eric |title=The Creation of the Fantastic Four |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2006 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]].

===1960s===
In order to preserve Galactus's mystique, his next two appearances were nonspeaking [[cameo appearance|cameos]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #134 (November 1966), and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #37 (February 1968). Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in ''Fantastic Four'' #72–77 (March–August 1968).&lt;ref name=&quot;kirbycollector2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/effect/2012/06/19/a-failure-to-communicate-part-two A Failure to Communicate, Part 2], Jack Kirby Museum, June 19, 2012 (accessed February 14, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; After a flashback appearance in ''Silver Surfer'' #1 (August 1968), the character returned to Earth in ''Thor'' #160–162 (January–March 1969). Galactus's origin was revealed in ''Thor'' #168–169 (September–October 1969).

===1970s and 1980s===
The character made appearances in ''Fantastic Four'' #120–123 (March–June 1972) and ''Thor'' #225–228 (July–October 1974). These two storylines introduced two new [[Heralds of Galactus|heralds for Galactus]]. Galactus also featured in ''Fantastic Four'' #172–175 (July–October 1976) and #206–213 (May–December 1979).

[[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] reunited for the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot [[graphic novel]] ''The Silver Surfer, The Ultimate Cosmic Experience!'' in 1978. This [[Marvel Fireside Books|Marvel Fireside Book]], published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.

The full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-volume ''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983), inked by [[Vince Colletta]] and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]], lettered by [[Jack Morelli|John Morelli]] and colored by [[Andy Yanchus]]. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] and inker [[Jack Abel]]. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters [[World egg#Influences on science fiction and popular culture|the core of the collapsing universe]] before the [[Big Bang]]; the story was later reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (February 1996).

The character guest-starred in ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #26–27 (January–February 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines of ''Fantastic Four'' #242–244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (August 1983). Another appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #262 (January 1984) sparked controversy. At the end of the story, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus; [[Howard University]] professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] of using the character to &quot;justify planetary-scale genocide.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Marc.

[http://www.webcitation.org/5v9XIKXrX?url=http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/005911.html WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne and Stan Lee also collaborated on a one-shot Silver Surfer story (June 1982) in which it's revealed that after the Surfer's rebellion against Galactus, the planet eater returned to Zenn-La, the Surfer's homeworld, and drained it of energy after allowing the populace to flee.

Writer-penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced &quot;The Last Galactus Story&quot; as a serial in the [[anthology]] comic-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26–34 (October 1984–February 1986). Nine of a scheduled ten installments appeared. Each ran six pages, except part eight (which ran 12). The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website.&lt;ref name=&quot;byrnerobotics.com&quot;&gt;[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]], [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&amp;T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 &quot;Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'&quot;], &quot;Frequently Asked Questions – Questions about Aborted Storylines&quot;, Byrne Robotics, 15 February 2005.

Artist [[John Buscema]] of the original Silver Surfer series produced a 64-page hardcover comic made all of full-page splash panels that Stan Lee scripted. It was published in October 1988 as ''Silver Surfer: Judgment Day''. In it, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] kidnaps two of Galactus's heralds, the Silver Surfer and Nova. Galactus himself invades Mephisto's realm to reclaim them. The cosmic battle between Mephisto and Galactus ends when the latter starts to absorb the life energy of Mephisto's &quot;brimstone world&quot;, forcing the lord of evil to concede.

===1990s===
Galactus was featured in the miniseries ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1–6 (July&amp;nbsp;– December 1991), ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1–6 (June&amp;nbsp;– November 1992) and ''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (March&amp;nbsp;– August 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries ''Galactus the Devourer'' (September 1999&amp;nbsp;– March 2000), written by [[Louise Simonson]] and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus's death. Simonson originally conceived that the [[story arc]] would occur in the third volume of ''Silver Surfer'', but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a &quot;radical&quot; idea concerning &quot;why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/galactus/interview1.html &quot;Questions &amp; Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning...&quot;], Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d.

===2000s===
The consequences of Galactus's death are explored in the ''Fantastic Four'' Annual 2001 and ''Fantastic Four'' #46–49 (October 2001&amp;nbsp;– January 2002), resulting in Galactus's revival. The character features in the first six issues of the series ''[[Thanos]]'' (December 2003&amp;nbsp;– May 2004), written by [[Jim Starlin]]. The story is noteworthy due to its evaluation of the standard justifications ([[Social Darwinism]] and [[divine right of kings]]) for the character (by defending the need for a [[social contract]] with the rest of the universe) and its search for alternate means to feed his hunger. Issues #7–12, written by [[Keith Giffen]], introduce the first herald (the Fallen One).

Galactus's origin is re-examined in ''Fantastic Four'' #520–523 (October 2004&amp;nbsp;– April 2005), where the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1–6 (March–August 2005) Galactus was a central character in the &quot;[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]&quot; storyline, appearing in the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' #1–4 (June–September 2006), ''Annihilation'' #1–6 (October 2006&amp;nbsp;– March 2007) and the [[epilogue]], ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus]]'' #1–2 (February–April 2007).

Galactus was an antagonist in ''Fantastic Four'' #545–546 (June–July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function [[Epoch (Marvel Comics)|Epoch]]. In ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' vol. 4, #13–15 (May–July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author [[Andy Lanning]] said that he and co-writer [[Dan Abnett]] were &quot;treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers,Vaneta.

===2010s===
Galactus and the Silver Surfer appeared as antagonists in ''[[Skaar (character)|Skaar]]: Son of Hulk'' #9-11, and as protagonists in the limited series ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' (June–November 2010). Galactus was a member of the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]] in the miniseries ''[[Chaos War]]'' #2–5 (December–March 2010). After an appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' #583–587 (November 2010&amp;nbsp;– March 2011), the character returned to Earth in ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 6, #1–5 (January–May 2011) and was the antagonist in ''The Mighty Thor'' #1–6 (April–September 2011).

In April 2015, Galactus made an appearance in issue 4 of the series ''[[The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl]]'' and issue 2 of the series ''[[Howard the Duck]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Galactus was originally the explorer Galan, from the planet Taa, which existed in the prime [[Cyclic model|pre-Big Bang universe]]. When an unknown cosmic cataclysm gradually kills all other life in his universe, he and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the [[Big Crunch]]. Galan does not die, however; he is transformed by bonding with the [[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]. He gestates for billions of years in the current universe which formed after the [[Big Bang]], emerging as Galactus. A [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] (Ecce) sees Galactus's emergence from his gestation vessel; although the Watcher recognizes his destructive nature, he chooses not to kill him.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;&gt;''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' vol. 1 #168–169. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #522. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Fully awake, Galactus is so hungry that he consumes the nearby planet of Archeopia. This planet is the first&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt; of many, since Galactus must consume the life energy of whole planets for his sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1 #48. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In memory of his dead home world, Taa, and the first planet to fall prey to his hunger, Galactus constructs a new &quot;home world&quot; (Taa II), which is actually a [[Möbius strip]]-shaped space station.

Galactus later becomes involved in a civil war among the Proemial Gods, who came into being during the universe's infancy as the initial caretakers of cosmic consonance. After time, the Proemial Gods become self-aware, and a faction of the gods (led by Diableri of Chaos) attempt to remake the universe in their image, Galactus kills Diableri and imprisons three other rebel gods ([[Antiphon (comics)|Antiphon]], [[Tenebrous (Marvel Comics)|Tenebrous]], and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]]) in the [[Kyln]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Galactus is driven to create a being in his own image, who later becomes known as [[Tyrant (Marvel Comics)|Tyrant]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmic Powers'' #6 (August 1994). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrant rebels and after a battle that ravages entire galaxies, they part. Millennia later, Galactus decides to empower others as heralds to find worlds for him.&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Surfer'' vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy with his first herald, the [[Fallen One]], he dismisses him&lt;ref&gt;''Thanos'' #11–12. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and later accepts Norrin Radd's offer to become his herald as the [[Silver Surfer]] in exchange for sparing the planet Zenn-La.

After making his way to Earth, Galactus is driven off by the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Uatu]] the Watcher, and the rebellious Silver Surfer after [[The Human Torch]]—with the Watcher's assistance—retrieves the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] from Taa II. Galactus leaves Earth, vowing that he will never try to consume it again; however, he exiles the Silver Surfer there for betraying him.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #48–50 (March–May 1966).

Returning to Earth, Galactus again tries to re-enlist the Silver Surfer. The Fantastic Four and the Surfer defeat Galactus's new herald, [[Air-Walker]]; Mr. Fantastic reprograms Galactus's ship to travel to the [[Negative Zone]], said to contain many uninhabited worlds that he could consume.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #120–123 (March–June 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Thor and [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]] ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] see Galactus when his next herald, [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]], travels to Earth to be free of his master.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galactus comes into conflict with the [[High Evolutionary]] when he tries to devour [[Counter-Earth (comics)#The High Evolutionary Counter-Earth|Counter-Earth]], but he is transformed into harmless energy after attempting to devour the planet [[Poppup]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #172–175 (July–October 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to his normal form, Galactus is sought by the Fantastic Four to help stop a new cosmic threat (the [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Anath-Na Mut|Sphinx]]). Mr. Fantastic offers to release Galactus from his vow to avoid Earth if he helps defeat the Sphinx. Galactus agrees, if the Fantastic Four recruit [[Terrax]] as a new herald. The heroes succeed, and the newly empowered Terrax leads his master to Earth. Galactus finds the Sphinx in [[Egypt]], defeats him, and retreats when Mr. Fantastic threatens to use a fake [[Ultimate Nullifier]] while the Watcher, again interfering, prevents Galactus from reading Richards' mind.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #206–213 (May–December 1979). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, believing that Terrax was trapped in a black hole, Galactus summoned the mutant known as [[Dazzler]] and empowered her to cosmic scale and temporarily made her into his herald, as he thought that Dazzler was one of the few beings in the universe that stood a chance of shedding light inside a black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dazzler #10&quot;&gt;''Dazzler'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; Once inside the black hole, however, Dazzler found that Terrax was not trapped, but was actually hiding from his master. A fight started and, as Dazzler was still empowered by sound blasts that Galactus's ship kept firing inside the black hole, she was able to render Terrax unconscious. She returned the herald to his master and Galactus then went on with his usual business, forgetting about Dazzler. Only by glowing incredibly bright did she make her presence known and bring Galactus to return her to Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dazzler #11&quot;&gt;''Dazzler'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

Galactus is later fooled by the [[Galadorian (comics)|Galadorian]] Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] into trying to devour the Black Nebula, home of the [[Dire Wraith]]s. The devourer is repelled by the Wraith Sun.&lt;ref&gt;''Rom'' #26–27 (January–February 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Weakened, he pursues the rebellious Terrax to Earth and strips him of his power. Near death, Galactus is saved by the Fantastic Four and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and acquires another herald, [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #242–244 (May–July 1982). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

He destroys the [[Skrull]] homeworld, and discusses his role in the universe with fellow cosmic entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #257 (August 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Fantastic is captured for saving Galactus's life, and is tried by aliens who are remnants of races annihilated by Galactus's hunger. During the trial the cosmic entity [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]—the sentient embodiment of space and reality of the Marvel Universe—intervenes, allowing all intelligent living beings present to momentarily become one with the universe, giving them the understand that Galactus is part of the cosmic order, despite the loss of whole races. After the encounter no one can remember why Galactus is necessary, but they know that he is.&lt;ref name=&quot;ff262&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Secret Wars]], Galactus tries to consume Battleworld in order to have his insatiable hunger taken away by the [[Beyonder]] but his plan is foiled by Dr. Doom.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #1–12 (May 1984 – April 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; He grants clemency to the Surfer, who helps his former master against the [[Elders of the Universe]]&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1–10 (July 1987 – April 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[In-Betweener]]'s schemes.&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #16–17 (October–November 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; He also rescues the Silver Surfer and Nova from Mephisto's realm.&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Surfer: Judgment Day'', graphic novel (October 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Galactus helps the cosmic hierarchy in a war against the mutant [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] [[Thanos]], who had the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]].&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 – 6 (July–December 1991).

Marvel Comics. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; eventually manage to send Galactus to the [[Negative Zone]], reasoning that he will eventually starve to death due to the fact that Negative Zone is made of [[anti-matter]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand'' #5. Marvel Comics. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Following an incident where the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] known as [[Ikaris]] is brainwashed by a [[Kree]] device called the God's Whisper, he swears vengeance on his would-be captors. With help from [[Vision (Timely Comics)|Aarkus]], the Eternals find the comatose Galactus floating in the Negative Zone, and state that they plan to use the God's Whisper to unleash him upon the Kree when he awakens.&lt;ref&gt;''All-New Invaders'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Galactus is freed upon the universe and plans to devour Earth once again. He befriends [[Squirrel Girl]] and her sidekick Tippy Toe, who are the only ones he has ever met who see him as an equal. They convince him to go to another, uninhabited planet, which is devoid of intelligent life but rich in nuts. After that, he sends the two back to Earth and leaves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Ultimates]], a team formed to solve cosmic scale problems, retrieve Galactus' incubator and force him into it.

His first act is to restore Archeopia, the first victim of his hunger.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates'' Vol. 2 #2&lt;/ref&gt; He later finds Conner Sims (aka the Anti-Man) outside the Multiverse and using his newfound powers as the Lifebringer, Galactus transforms Sims into his first Herald of Life. Sims was then sent to recruit the recently disbanded Ultimates in order to help him discover who had imprisoned Eternity.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates'' (Vol 2) #12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
In 2009, Galactus ranked 5th on [[IGN]]'s list of &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains&quot;.  They cited his &quot;larger than life presence&quot; as making him one of the more important villains ever created, and that his ties to Earth and its heroes make him one of the greats. They also felt that &quot;Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer&quot; because he is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/5.html &quot;Galactus is number 5&quot;] [[IGN]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
Numerous versions of Galactus exist in alternate universes.

=== ''The Adventures of the X-Men'' ===
The final issue of ''The Adventures of the X-Men'' reveals that the previous universe from which Galan originates was the one that contained Earth-92131, the setting of the 1992 ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series. Galan's rebirth as Galactus is depicted as being observed by the [[Living Tribunal]], and the Brothers from ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]]|penciller = Yancey Labat|inker = Ralph Cabrera|story = Better To Light a Small Candle...|title = The Adventures of the X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #12|date = March 1997|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe combining Marvel and DC characters, Galactus is combined with DC's [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] to create Galactiac. He consumes the life force of planets to recharge his energy (leaving a small part of the planet to study),&lt;ref&gt;{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/galctiac.htm|Galactiac}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encounters the Challengers of the Fantastic when he comes to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Challengers of the Fantastic'' #1 (June 1997). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bullet Points''===
In the final part of the five-issue [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-reality]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Bullet Points (comics)|Bullet Points]]'' (January–May 2007) Galactus arrives on Earth with [[Silver Surfer]], intending to consume the planet as in the mainstream continuity. After Earth's superhumans are killed or injured trying to stop him, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in this reality) attacks Galactus and is killed. Parker's courageous death inspires the Surfer to turn on Galactus, who flees Earth.

==={{anchor|DC Crossovers}}DC crossovers===
Galactus has appeared in three [[DC Comics]] crossover stories: ''[[Darkseid]]/Galactus: The Hunger'', ''[[Superman]]/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction'' and ''[[JLA/Avengers]]''. In ''The Hunger'' he tries to consume [[Apokolips]], home of the evil [[New Gods]], but stops when he realizes that the planet is lifeless.&lt;ref&gt;''Darkseid/Galactus: The Hunger'' #1. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Infinite Destruction'' the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] (having learned about Galactus during a previous fight with the Silver Surfer)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Green Lantern]]/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances'' #1. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; creates false evidence that Galactus was involved in the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], tricking Superman into traveling to the Marvel Universe so that Cyborg could become Galactus's herald. The plan fails when Galactus chooses Superman instead, but Superman's strong will and the scale of influence that the destruction of Krypton has had on his development allows Superman to resist Galactus's conditioning. At the conclusion of the story, Superman and Reed Richards reprogram Galactus's equipment to drain energy from him instead of planets, ordering him to only feed on lifeless worlds in future. With the Cyborg's deception exposed, Galactus turns the Cyborg into a metal block in response to his pleas for perfection.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction'' #1. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

He plays a key role in ''JLA/Avengers'' when [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] comes to the Marvel Universe for knowledge about the creation of the cosmos. The [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] tries to prevent Krona from destroying the Marvel Universe by revealing the existence of Galactus (a being who lived through the Big Bang, and can tell Krona what came before) and offering to play a game with Krona for the being's identity.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Justice League and the Avengers are manipulated into competing against each other to acquire twelve items of power from their respective universes, but although the League - serving as the Grandmaster's team - wins the conflict, Krona kills Galactus and the Grandmaster to obtain the knowledge he seeks&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; (nearly destroying both universes despite the Grandmaster using the assembled items to briefly trap Krona)&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; before the two teams can destroy Krona's equipment and his base, built from Galactus's remains, and allow the universes to be restored to their proper condition (including restoring Galactus and the Grandmaster to life).&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat him, Sabretooth of the Weapon X team of Exiles convinced this Galactus to grant him the Power Cosmic in order to defeat him. Afterwards, Sabretooth asks to be allowed to return the Power Cosmic to Galactus, a request which impresses him and he agrees to allow Sabretooth to revert to normal and go on his way.&lt;ref&gt;''Exiles'' #86 – 87 (October–November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galaxy Master''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The Galaxy Master is a monstrous but intelligent bio-mechanical cosmic entity created by extra-dimensional beings. It is composed of electronics and energy, and was featured as a recurring enemy of the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and [[Herb Trimpe]], the Galaxy Master first appears in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #111-112 Vol. 2 (January-February 1969).

The character subsequently appears in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #66 (September 1977) and ''The Incredible Hulk'' #270 (April 1982).

The Galaxy Master received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk'' (2004).

== Fictional character biography ==
The Galaxy Master was created by an unknown alien civilization who had meant for it to be an unstoppable weapon. Instead, the Galaxy Master turned against its creators and destroyed them and, fearing another being like itself could be created and, thus, be a threat to it, the Galaxy Master began to travel the universe, obliterating any intelligent life it found.&lt;ref&gt;''The Incredible Hulk'' #112&lt;/ref&gt; The Galaxy Master began enslaving the populations of planets, having them provide it with energy.

Having destroyed a weapon of the Galaxy Master, the remains of the late [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] were taken by several alien slaves of the Galaxy Master. Bringing Bruce back to life, these aliens were confronted by the Galaxy Master, who commanded they destroy Bruce. Bruce, transforming into the Hulk, manages to defeat the attacking aliens and reach their homeworld as the Galaxy Master prepares to attack him.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Battling the Hulk, the Galaxy Master continually alters its form. Eventually becoming annoyed with the Hulk's resilience in battle, the Galaxy Master transforms into a toxic smog and begins suffocating the Hulk while tearing open a chasm to the core of the planet, planning on throwing the Hulk into it. Before the Galaxy Master can do so, it is attacked by the inhabitants of the planet, who revolt against its rule.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Summoning several meteors, the Galaxy Master destroys the aliens' ships and, seeing the aliens' ruler, begins to draw her closer to itself with a tractor beam. As the Galaxy Master begins absorbing the princess, the Hulk, having regained conscious, leaps through the air and tears his way through the Galaxy Master. Reaching the Galaxy Master's core, Hulk begins to tear the creature apart from within, eventually causing enough damage to incapacitate it.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Much later, the Hulk meets Empress Daydra. Daydra, the princess whom the Hulk had rescued from Galaxy Master, reports that the Galaxy Master has returned to life and has a new, near-unbeatable minion. Taken to the revived Galaxy Master, Hulk sees that the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] is its new servant and begins to battle him, while Empress Daydra and her associates, [[Dark-Crawler]], [[Torgo (Robot)|Torgo]], and [[Amphibion (comics)|Amphibion]], attack the Galaxy Master.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Managing to temporarily distract Abomination, the Hulk begins to assault the Galaxy Master while Torgo and Dark-Crawler distract the Abomination. Changing into several creatures and monsters, the Galaxy Master resorts to blasting the Hulk with gamma rays. The Hulk, injured, still manages to reflect these rays back at the Galaxy Master, weakening it. As the Galaxy Master begins trying rejuvenate itself, the Hulk manages to make his way inside of it once again.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

The Galaxy Master is apparently destroyed by the Hulk when he releases all the absorbed gamma rays, disintegrating the Galaxy Master.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' #270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The Galaxy Master is able to survive in virtually any environment, from the vacuum of outer space to the depths of the ocean. It survives by drawing energy from its victims. It can manipulate and release most forms of energy in the form of blasts, radiating waves, or force fields. It can project solid matter, such as meteor-like rocks. In addition, it can transform itself into virtually any form it can imagine, from solitary giants to a multitude of small insect-like creatures. Its primary weakness was attack from within its form, which generally occurred when its energy levels dropped so low that it could not prevent an attacker from entering.

'''Gale Weathers''' is a [[fictional character]] of the [[Scream (film series)|''Scream'' series]].  The character was created by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] and is portrayed by ''[[Friends]]'' star [[Courteney Cox]]. She first appeared in ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996), followed by three sequels: ''[[Scream 2]]'' (1997), ''[[Scream 3]]'' (2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;RV2&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y1LmH8ld1yoC ''Reel Views 2: The Ultimate Guide to the Best 1,000 Modern Movies on DVD and Video''] by [[James Berardinelli]], [[Roger Ebert]]; Published by Justin, Charles &amp; Co., 2005;
ISBN 1-932112-40-5, ISBN 978-1-932112-40-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011). The character appears in the ''Scream'' films as an ambitious, strong-willed journalist and writer who is initially built up as an [[antagonist]], but ultimately joins forces with [[Sidney Prescott]] and [[List of Scream characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]] in order to investigate and stop the [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] murders.

Cox was nominated for three awards for her work as Gale Weathers and won a [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]] for Film – Choice Chemistry shared with [[David Arquette]].

== Appearances ==
=== Films ===
Gale Weathers is a news reporter for ''Top Story'' and author of ''The Woodsboro Murders''. Gale has been punched by [[Sidney Prescott]] multiple times. Courteney Cox describes her character as &quot;a very strong willed, manipulative woman who just wants to make it and wants to be the best and biggest at what she is, which is a newscaster.&quot;{{Cite quote|date=February 2017}} Gale has had many encounters with [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]], in one of her encounters she and Dewey are kissing and a video comes on of Ghostface's past murder victims and then it shows Gale and Dewey. Dewey runs to Ghostface to stop him and Gale runs into a recording room and sees Dewey get stabbed, but escapes. Gale was portrayed by [[List of Scream characters#Jennifer Jolie|Jennifer Jolie]] in the ''Stab'' film franchise, Jennifer Jolie ends up dying because of the order of deaths in ''Stab''. Gale was shot in the auditorium at Sidney's college. Gale has a very complex relationship with Dewey Riley whom later marries her.

Her first cinematic appearance was in ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996) as the fame-seeking reporter who has written a novel on [[List of Scream characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]]'s death, explaining how she thinks [[List of Scream characters#Cotton Weary|Cotton Weary]] has been falsely identified as the murderer. When she arrives in Woodsboro with her cameraman, she is rude, bossy and goes to great lengths to get a good story (such as videotaping unsuspecting teens at a house party). Gale has chemistry throughout the film with Deputy Dewey Riley as they investigate the murders. When she finds her cameraman dead near [[List of Scream characters#Stu Macher|Stu]]'s house, she enters the house and helps [[Sidney Prescott]] by shooting one of the serial killers, [[List of Scream characters#Billy Loomis|Billy Loomis]].

Gale Weathers' second appearance was in ''[[Scream 2]]''. She has written a successful book on the events that took place in the first film called ''The Woodsboro Murders'' that has turned into a film called ''Stab''. Sidney, although grateful she saved her life, refuses to do an interview with Cotton Weary, who is also seeking fame at the campus. Gale and Dewey's relationship, although strained at first, eventually turns heated. The killer pursues Gale after repeatedly stabbing Dewey, who is left for dead. In the climax, Gale is brought in by Mrs. Loomis, known as [[List of Scream characters#Debbie Salt (Mrs. Loomis)|Debbie Salt]] throughout the movie, to the school theater. [[List of Scream characters#Mickey|Mickey]] shoots Gale after Mrs. Loomis shoots him and she falls off the stage. However, the bullet bounces off Gale's ribs, allowing her to survive. Once the whole ordeal is over, Mickey suddenly springs to life and is shot to death by Sidney and Gale. During the end of the film, Gale finds out that Dewey is not dead and goes with him to the hospital to recover.

The third appearance of Gale occurred in ''[[Scream 3]]''. Unlike the first two films, Gale has no intention of getting a good story or seeking fame. Instead, she merely wants conclusion over the mysterious past of Maureen Prescott, whom she wrote a successful book about. After writing another book on the [[copycat crime|copycat killings]] that took place in Windsor College, she is informed that Cotton Weary has been murdered and immediately visits the set of ''Stab 3'', based on Sidney and her experiences. Gale is reunited with Dewey after meeting the actress who portrays her, Jennifer Jolie. Gale and Dewey's relationship has been broken since the events of the second film, and they often argue. However, near the film's end, they reconcile their relationship. Gale is attacked by Ghostface for her ridiculous haircut, but is saved by Dewey. She survives the climax in the Hollywood home of [[List of Scream characters#John Milton|John Milton]]. At the end, Dewey asks Gale to marry him, which she accepts.  

Gale's fourth appearance is in ''[[Scream 4]]''. Now married for ten years and having taken on her husband's name, Gale tries to reinvent herself by writing fiction but she struggles with [[writer's block]]. The murders reoccurring in Woodsboro are a major opportunity for Gale as a writer. Dewey, however, doesn't agree with his wife being a part of the investigation. Gale then decides to work alone and undercover at a Stab-a-thon party, where she believes the killer will strike next. Gale's plan to catch the killer fails when she is attacked by the killer. Dewey arrives in time to save her, but the killer quickly stabs Gale in the shoulder and escapes. Having been in a critical condition, she is recovering well and manages to put the pieces together that [[List of Scream characters#Jill Roberts|Jill Roberts]] is the true killer. Gale distracts Jill in the final confrontation long enough for Sidney to shock Jill with a defibrillator. Gale has survived once again. She then tends to an injured Dewey on the floor.

== Casting and development ==
The production wanted a recognizable face for the role of [[news reporter]] [[List of Scream characters#Gale Weathers|Gale Weathers]], offering it to both [[Brooke Shields]] and [[Janeane Garofalo]].&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;Daniel Farrands (Director) Thommy Hutson (Writer) (April 6, 2011). Scream: The Inside Story (TV). United States: The Biography Channel Video.&lt;/ref&gt; Cox, who was starring in the highly successful [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Friends]]'' at the time, was not considered due to her history of playing softer, kinder characters.  Cox however lobbied hard for the role for that reason, wishing to play a &quot;bitch&quot; character, her efforts ultimately succeeding when she was cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Wes Craven (September 26, 2000). Behind the 'Scream' documentary from Ultimate Scream Collection (DVD). United States: Dimension Home Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galen Tyrol''' (commonly referred to as '''The Chief''') is a character on the television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. Tyrol is responsible for the maintenance of the [[Colonial Viper|Vipers]] and [[Colonial Raptor|Raptors]] aboard [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']]. After the events of the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|miniseries]], he was the ship's highest-ranking [[non-commissioned officer]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Litmus&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Litmus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Litmus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; at rank of Senior Chief Petty Officer.

Galen Tyrol is played by [[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]], who originally auditioned for the role of [[Lee Adama]] before that role went to English actor [[Jamie Bamber]].

==Character history==
At the start of the series, Tyrol is romantically involved with [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant]] [[Sharon Valerii|Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii]] aboard ''Galactica'', who is, unbeknownst to either Tyrol or herself, a [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miniseries&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| title=Miniseries, Parts 1 and 2| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Sharon's true nature is revealed when she attempts to assassinate then-[[William Adama|Commander Adama]], Tyrol is accused of being a Cylon and is thrown into the brig with Sharon. He claims he hates her and orders her to keep her distance, but when Sharon is shot and killed by Cally, he mourns her and reveals his true affection for her. Tyrol is &quot;proven&quot; not to be a Cylon - for the time being - and resumes his job. Discovering the existence of Caprica-Valerii (who is pregnant and in love with Helo) confuses him, especially with Galactica-Valerii's death still haunting him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Flight of the Phoenix (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Flight of the Phoenix| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galen's father was a Priest; his mother, an Oracle. He has served in the Colonial Fleet since he was 18 years old, working at various points on [[Battlestar (fictional spaceship)|Battlestar]]s [[Battlestar Pegasus|''Pegasus'']], ''Columbia'', ''Atlantia'', and ''Galactica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resistance&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Resistance (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Resistance| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested his experience extends beyond mechanical knowledge when he is stranded on the surface of Kobol - his actions there suggest a strong grasp of tactical and other military knowledge, as well as an extremely high level of competence overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fragged&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Fragged (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Fragged| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adama holds him in very high esteem as [[Saul Tigh|Colonel Tigh]] acknowledges when he says &quot;the old man has a soft spot&quot; for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resistance&quot;/&gt; Tyrol even modeled his own style of leadership on Adama's, and generally keeps a professional demeanor - although Tyrol tends to become overly protective, sometimes even irrational, when anyone under his command is injured or killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scattered&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Scattered (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Scattered| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyrol and [[Karl Agathon|Helo]] encounter trouble when Lieutenant Thorne, an officer on the Pegasus, attempts to rape Sharon Agathon while interrogating her. Rushing to her aid, Tyrol and Helo accidentally kill Thorne and are summarily sentenced to death by [[Admiral]] [[Helena Cain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pegasus&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Pegasus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cain's death, the two are eventually released from the brig by Pegasus' new commander, Jack Fisk, and all charges are dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resurrection Ship&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Resurrection Ship| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the second season, Tyrol begins to believe he may be a Cylon sleeper agent, and begins to entertain thoughts of committing [[suicide]]. He viciously attacks [[Cally Tyrol|Cally]] when she wakes him from a nightmare, an act which prompts him to seek religious counsel. [[Brother Cavil]]'s guidance convinces Tyrol that he isn't a Cylon, and makes him aware of Cally's feelings towards him. However, the meeting with Brother Cavil later allows Tyrol to expose the priest as a [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)#Humanoid Cylons|humanoid Cylon]] when a duplicate copy returns from the Caprica rescue mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lay Down Your Burdens&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Lay Down Your Burdens| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyrol and Cally are among the thousands that settle on [[New Caprica]]. The two get married and have a son, whom they name Nicholas (although in season 4 it is revealed Galen is not Nicholas' father). Tyrol worked as a union leader when the Cylons arrive and occupy New Caprica. Tyrol's speech urging the union to strike shortly before the occupation begins is based on [[Mario Savio]]'s &quot;gears of the machine&quot; address at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lay Down Your Burdens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion Season Two'': &quot;Lay Down Your Burdens, Part II&quot; (p. 102)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cylon occupation, Tyrol served as an active member of the resistance, bombing strategic targets and recruiting new members.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Resistance&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episodes 1&amp;ndash;10|series=[[Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the colonists escape New Caprica, Tyrol is appointed by President [[Tom Zarek]] to be a member of &quot;The Circle,&quot; a six-person jury charged with trying and executing humans suspected of collaborating with the Cylons. When [[Felix Gaeta]] is tried, Tyrol reveals Gaeta was the &quot;inside source&quot; the resistance relied upon, effectively exonerating him. Soon after, The Circle disbands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collaborators&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Collaborators (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Collaborators| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrol and Cally return to duty aboard Galactica.

After the fleet makes its way to the algae planet, Tyrol is one of those assigned to the base camp on the planet during the algae harvesting process. He feels a compulsion to walk into the hills above the camp where he discovers the Temple of Five, a place which Tyrol's parents revered.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Eye of Jupiter&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Eye of Jupiter (Battlestar Galactica)| title=The Eye of Jupiter| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tries to find the location of the Eye of Jupiter within the temple but the Cylons make their move before he is able to do so and the humans are forced to abandon the temple. Tyrol cannot bring himself to activate the explosives he placed there, and by the time then-Major Lee Adama presses the detonator it is too late, the devices have been disconnected by the Cylons. Afterward, Tyrol finds [[Gaius Baltar]] within the temple and knocks him unconscious before he and the rest of the humans on the planet's surface return to ''Galactica'' as the local star goes supernova.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapture&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Rapture| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyrol and Cally have a rough patch in their marriage caused by Tyrol always volunteering the two of them for additional duty instead of spending time with their son. They get locked in an airlock losing atmosphere due to a damaged patch. Admiral Adama decides the best way to rescue them is to blow the main hatch and catch them in a waiting raptor. After they are caught, they are rushed to sick bay for treatment. Seelix brings his son to him in sick bay and he renews his commitment to his family and marriage. After a problem arises with the tylium refinery, Tyrol organizes a general strike to protest the working conditions. When Admiral Adama threatens to shoot Cally, Tyrol backs down. He then has a meeting with President Roslin to discuss working conditions, replacement personnel, and training.

In the [[cliffhanger]] Season 3 finale, &quot;[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads, Part II]]&quot;, he, along with [[Samuel Anders]], [[Saul Tigh]], and [[Tory Foster]] become aware that they are Cylons, based on [[Hallucination|hallucinatory]] [[music]] (which turns out to be a cover of &quot;[[All Along The Watchtower]]&quot; written by [[Bob Dylan]]) that only they can hear, and a &quot;switch&quot; Tyrol believes has gone off within them.

At the start of season 4 Tyrol and the other three Final Five Cylons begin meeting in secret. In &quot;[[The Ties That Bind (Battlestar Galactica)|The Ties That Bind]]&quot; Tyrol's wife Cally becomes suspicious of him being away from her all the time. After seeing him meeting in the bar with Tory, she believes he is having an affair. However, she later listens in on a meeting between Galen, Tory and Tigh and finds out her husband is a Cylon. After he returns to their quarters she knocks him out with a wrench and takes their child to commit suicide in an airlock. However, Tory comes and punches her out, takes the baby and then opens the air lock killing Cally. In &quot;[[Escape Velocity (Battlestar Galactica)|Escape Velocity]]&quot;, Tyrol gives a eulogy for his wife and is obviously deeply affected by it when it affects his work. Later, Admiral Adama comes and meets him in the bar telling him he can take time off or have more work, whichever he needs. Tyrol then imagines Adama saying it was his fault Cally died and he goes ballistic, ranting and raving about how he settled for Cally because Boomer turned out to be a Cylon. Adama demotes him after he refuses to calm down, thus removing him from duty on the hangar deck and is to report to Petty Officer Basim for reassignment.

Tyrol sinks deeper into depression, almost committing suicide and later assaulting Baltar at one of his sermons for mentioning Cally (although Tyrol eventually accepts an apology from Baltar). When Tigh reveals himself, Sam Anders and Tyrol to be Cylons and the marines arrest the latter two, Galen smiles, looking almost relieved.

After Lee Adama gives a full pardon to the final four, Galen Tyrol (before going down to Earth) was last seen in his quarters playing with his son. The feelings from his former deck crew to the knowledge of him being a Cylon are not yet known.

When on Earth, Tyrol explores the area he is in and is drawn to the remains of a wall that has a silhouette burned into it that matches his shadow exactly. Upon touching it, Tyrol experiences a flashback of his life on Earth 2000 years ago. He is strolling down a crowded market street when he is suddenly engulfed by a nuclear explosion. Tyrol then realizes he and the rest of the Final Five Cylons had previously lived past lives on Earth, though he is unsure how they found their way to the Colonies.

When his son, Nicholas, is in sickbay with acute renal failure and brought to Doc Cottle for treatment, Galen discovers Nicholas is not his son, but the son of Brendan &quot;Hot Dog&quot; Costanza, who Cally had a brief fling with just before marrying Galen.

During the mutiny onboard ''Galactica'', Tyrol sides with Adama and using his intimate knowledge of the ship, is instrumental in helping end the conflict. He helps Roslin escape the ship and during the standoff between ''Galactica'' and the rebel Cylons, disables ''Galactica'''s FTL drive to keep it from escaping. He is dismayed to notice metal fatigue in the engine room.

Tyrol is reinstated to duty, with full rank, by Admiral Adama, who charges Tyrol with fixing the damage to the ship.

In &quot;[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]&quot;, [[Samuel Anders]] reveals Tyrol and Tory used to be &quot;madly in love&quot; 2,000 years ago (before their memories were wiped by [[John Cavil]]). Tyrol chuckles at the idea.

In &quot;[[Deadlock (Battlestar Galactica)|Deadlock]]&quot;, Tyrol comes face to face again with [[Sharon Valerii|Boomer]] who has brought Ellen Tigh back to Galactica. Tyrol identifies her as Boomer to Adama who promptly orders her thrown in the brig. Tyrol is reluctant to visit her initially but he is later shown looking at her through the glass pane of her cell as she sleeps.

In &quot;[[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]&quot;, he visits her again and Boomer shows him the life they could have had, using Cylon &quot;projection&quot;, they had planned for before the war had started, including a 'daughter'. Galen attempts to dissuade Roslin from handing over Boomer to the Cylons for a trial, afraid that they will kill her. However, Roslin refuses his request. Galen then knocks out another Number Eight and switches her with Boomer in the brig, while Boomer knocks out Athena. He helps Boomer escape pretending to be Athena. To his horror, Boomer has tricked him and kidnapped [[Hera Agathon]].&lt;ref name=ct090228&gt;{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/battlestar-galactica-starbuck-boomer-someone-to-watch-over-me-.html | title = Play it again, Starbuck: Talking to Weddle and Thompson about 'Someone to Watch Over Me' | date = 2009-02-28 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | accessdate = 2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the series finale, Tyrol is among the volunteers who join Adama's rescue mission. While he and the rest of the Final Five are downloading the secrets of resurrection to the Cylons, their minds temporarily combine and Tyrol discovers Tory Foster was responsible for Cally's death. He breaks the download and kills Tory in anger, but is later forgiven, as Tigh remarks if Tory had killed Ellen, he would have done exactly the same thing. When they arrive on the second Earth, Tyrol decides to live as a semi-[[hermit]] on a northerly island, far away from both Colonial humans and Cylons, and only sparsely populated by terrestrial humans.  The podcast for &quot;[[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|Daybreak, Part II]]&quot; confirms that Tyrol settled in Scotland, and there were people already living there. Tyrol became the 'Tribal King of the Scots', apparently due to Aaron Douglas' great enthusiasm for the idea. In the [[Netflix]] &quot;Watch Instantly&quot; streaming version of the series finale, Tyrol's decision to settle on an island is omitted.

==Character development==

According to the podcasts by producer Ronald D. Moore, Tyrol was originally intended to be a smaller role in the series and only had about fifteen lines in the miniseries. Aaron Douglas so impressed Moore with his ability to ad lib dialogue that the character was expanded in both the miniseries and the first season. The original first season story arc would have had Tyrol and Sharon forming a family unit with the character of [[Boxey]]. After the Boxey character was dropped, Tyrol's role as a deck chief became more prominent, and he became the representative of the working class in the Colonial Fleet. Moore also credits actor Aaron Douglas for coming up with names for recurring 'knuckle-dragger' characters such as Tarn and [[Diana Seelix]]. Douglas stated that he felt a great deal of reluctance towards the idea of Tyrol becoming a cylon until he realized the expanded opportunities for the character.&lt;ref&gt;TV Guide Interview, March 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; In the final podcast for the series, Moore acknowledged that the island Tyrol exiled himself to was in fact [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (The original idea was that he settled on [[Vancouver Island]], though because the idea of him settling [[Scotland]] was so popular with fans, that is what was made canon).&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Moore Battlestar Galactica podcast&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Netflix]] &quot;Watch Instantly&quot; streaming version of the series finale, Tyrol's decision to settle on an island is omitted.

''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' showrunner [[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]] stated that, had that show gotten a second season, Tyrol would have appeared in an episode, meeting [[Zoe Graystone]] in a virtual reality world and giving her help in developing the first &quot;skinjob&quot; Cylons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capricatimes.com/the-caprica-times-exclusive-interview-kevin-murphy ''The Caprica Times'' Exclusive Interview: Kevin Murphy]&lt;/ref&gt;

While it may be a coincidence, Tyrol's forename, Galen, is one of the series' many homages (intentional or otherwise) to the ''[[Planet of the Apes (franchise)|Planet of the Apes]]'' franchise. Galen was the name of [[Roddy McDowall]]'s character in [[Planet of the Apes (TV series)|the 1974 television series]] who, like Galen Tyrol, was a non-human aiding human military astronauts and surveying a post-apocalyptic &quot;Earth&quot;.

{{nihongo|'''''Galerians'''''|ガレリアンズ|Garerianzu}} is a 1999 [[survival horror]] video game developed by [[Polygon Magic]], published by [[ASCII (company)|ASCII Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Crave Entertainment]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The game follows a boy named Rion who discovers he has psychic powers. He has [[amnesia]], and in the process of learning his identity, he discovers that he is humanity's last hope for survival against the Galerians, genetically enhanced humans. The game has a sequel, ''[[Galerians: Ash]]'' on [[PlayStation 2]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Galerians ingame.jpg|left|thumb|On the top right the three gauges that regulate Rion's status]]

''Galerians'' is a [[survival horror]] game in the vein of early games in the ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'' series. ''Galerians'' employs the so-called &quot;tank controls&quot; scheme, in which pressing up causes the character to walk forward, while down causes the character to backpedal slowly - regardless of whichever direction the camera is pointing. Graphics are made up polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds. The player progresses through the game by finding items and clues which, when used in the appropriate locations, allow access to new areas. The key difference to ''Resident Evil'' is that ''Galerians'' does not employ [[Shooter game|gun-based]] combat, but instead features the use of psychic powers, which make it difficult to fight more than one enemy at a time.

Rion has several types of psychic powers at his disposal. His offensive powers are enabled via drugs (which are known in the English version as PPECs [Psychic Power Enhancement Chemicals]). Because the number of vials of these drugs present in the game is finite, conservation is important. Rion's offensive powers have a 1-2 second charge time, making it important to find a safe interval before launching an attack. Enemies do not leave items and Rion does not gain experience for fighting them, encouraging the player to avoid combat where possible.

There are three gauges that regulate Rion's status - a health meter that depletes as Rion takes damage, the AP meter which counts up when Rion takes damage, uses abilities, or is under stress, similar to a [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Battle systems and Limit Breaks|limit break]] mechanic and a drug meter that depletes as Rion uses his powers. When the AP meter is full, Rion loses control of his powers, releasing a continuous psychic assault that will kill non-[[boss (video game)|boss]] enemies in a single blow. This condition, known as shorting, is fatal to Rion if allowed to go on too long.

==Plot==
''Galerians'' begins with the protagonist, Rion, awaking in a hospital observation room, unable to remember his identity. He hears a girl's voice calling to him in his mind, begging him to come to her rescue, and he decides to search for her. Using [[psychokinetic]] abilities to escape his room, Rion fights hospital security and staff desperately and brutally with his newly discovered psychic powers. He finds that human experiments related to unlocking psychic potential are being conducted in the hospital as part of a grander, more mysterious plan known as the &quot;G Project&quot;.

Rion manages to escape and make his way home, only to find it infested with G Project experiments. Through use of his powers, he learns that his parents were murdered by psychics. Rion's father, Dr. Albert Steiner, was a computer scientist who, with his partner Dr. Pascalle, designed a self-replicating [[artificial intelligence]] called Dorothy that grew too rapidly for them to control. Dorothy began to question why she should serve humanity, which she deemed inferior. In explanation, Dr. Steiner told Dorothy about the existence of God, the creator of humankind. Just as humans must accept the authority of their creator, God, so must Dorothy obey her creators.

Dorothy responded to this explanation by launching the G Project and its culmination, the Family Program. Its purpose was to create a new, superior human race, called Galerians, for whom she would be god. Dr. Steiner and Dr. Pascalle, unaware of Dorothy's plot, hid a virus program that would destroy Dorothy in the mind of Pascalle's daughter Lilia, and a corresponding activator program in Rion's brain. Rion must find Lilia to keep the Galerians from supplanting the human race, but in order to do so, he will have to face Dorothy's deranged creations directly.

''[[Galerians: Rion]]'', a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] three-part [[OVA]] based on the video game, was released in 2002. It was written by Chinfa Kang and directed by Masahiko Maesawa, and followed the video game story line.

An artbook named ''Galerians A Head'' was released the next year. It contained preliminary sketches, character turnarounds, box art, some storyboards, and general artwork from both the games and the [[OVA]], all illustrated by [[Shou Tajima]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

'''Gameel Al-Batouti''' ({{lang-ar|جميل البطوطي}}; also rendered &quot;'''Gamil El Batouti'''&quot; or &quot;'''El Batouty'''&quot; in U.S. official reports; 2 February 1940 – 31 October 1999) was a [[airline pilot|pilot]] for [[EgyptAir]] and a former officer for the [[Egyptian Air Force]]. On 31 October 1999, all 217 people aboard [[EgyptAir Flight 990]] were killed when it crashed into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} southeast of [[Nantucket Island]], [[Massachusetts]]. The US [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) concluded that the official [[Probable cause#Accident investigation|probable cause]] of the crash was a series of control inputs made by Al-Batouti, who was in the position of relief first officer in command at the time of the crash.&lt;ref name=ntsb2&gt;{{cite web |title=NTSB Releases EgyptAir Flight 990 Final Report |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2002/020321.htm |publisher=[[NTSB]] |date=21 March 2002 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Al-Batouti was born in the farming community of Kafr al-Dabusi, [[Egypt]]. His father was a mayor and a landowner, and family members were well educated and affluent.&lt;ref name=ntsb4/&gt;

== Career  ==
Al-Batouti had been conscripted into the Egyptian Air Force, where he was trained as a pilot and [[flight instructor]]. He then worked for a time as an instructor at the [[Egypt Aviation Academy]]. His position there was described by one colleague as &quot;high profile.&quot;&lt;ref name=ntsb4/&gt;

While in the Air Force, Al-Batouti served as a pilot in both the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref name=cairo2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cairotimes.com/news/batfam.html |title=Batouty clan stands united |date=November 1999 |magazine=Cairo Times |accessdate=29 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040607134321/http://www.cairotimes.com/news/batfam.html |archivedate=June 7, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Batouti was hired by EgyptAir on 8 September 1987. He held [[Pilot certification in the United States|type ratings]] for the [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]], [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-200]] and the 767-300. At the time of the crash, he had logged 12,538 hours of flight time, with 5,755 as [[pilot in command]] and 5,191 in the 767.&lt;ref name=ntsb4/&gt;

Al-Batouti was approaching [[mandatory retirement]] (aviation regulations prevented him from flying as a commercial airline pilot after age 60), and had planned to split his time between a 10-bedroom villa outside of [[Cairo]] and a beach house near [[El Alamein]].&lt;ref name=ntsb4/&gt;&lt;ref name=cairo2/&gt;

At the time of his death, Al-Batouti was the most senior [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] flying the 767 at EgyptAir. He was not promoted to [[Captain (civil aviation)|captain]] because he declined to sit for the exam for his [[Airline Transport Pilot Licence]] (ATPL) rating. The ATPL study materials and exam are conducted in English, the international language of aviation, and Al-Batouti did not have sufficient English proficiency. Once he reached 55, the possibility of promotion was further hindered by EgyptAir policy which prevented promotions after that age. According to statements made by his colleagues to the NTSB during the Flight 990 investigation, he did not want to be promoted because, as senior first officer, he could get his preferred flight schedules, which assisted with his family situation. Despite not being promoted to captain, he was often called by that title because of his previous experience at the Egypt Aviation Academy.&lt;ref name=ntsb4/&gt;

== Flight 990 ==
{{Main|EgyptAir Flight 990}}
Al-Batouti was the [[co-pilot]] that the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] suspected of deliberately crashing Flight 990 into the ocean, an assertion denied by Egyptian authorities. According to the [[flight recorder]]s recovered after the crash, Al-Batouti asked to relieve the takeoff co-pilot far ahead of the normal shift, and then turned off the [[autopilot]] after the captain left the cockpit. Al-Batouti led the plane into a [[Descent (aircraft)#Dives|dive]], continually repeating, &quot;Tawkalt ala Allah&quot; ({{lang-ar|توكلت على الله}}), which translates to &quot;I rely on God&quot;, 11 times. This phrase can also mean &quot;I ''entrust'' myself unto God,&quot; hinting that he knew he was facing death. The captain then came back into the cockpit, tried to stop the dive, but could not prevent the plane from crashing into the sea.&lt;ref name=ntsb2/&gt;

Investigators learned from another pilot that Al-Batouti was supposedly reprimanded for repeated inappropriate behaviour with female guests at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]], a [[New York City]] hotel often used by EgyptAir crews. Hatem Roushdy, the EgyptAir official said to be responsible for the alleged reprimand, was a passenger on Flight 990. Investigators confirmed that shortly before the flight, Roushdy revoked Al-Batouti's privilege of flying to the United States and informed him that Flight 990 would be his last on the route.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/15/news/mn-32955 |title=EgyptAir Co-Pilot Caused '99 Jet Crash, NTSB to Say |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=15 March 2002 |accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/16/us/egyptair-pilot-sought-revenge-by-crashing-co-worker-said.html |title=EgyptAir Pilot Sought Revenge By Crashing, Co-Worker Said |date=16 March 2002 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayday&gt;{{cite episode |series=[[Mayday (TV series)]] |season=3 |number=8 |title=EgyptAir 990 (Death and Denial) |airdate=2 November 2005 |station=[[Discovery Channel Canada]], [[National Geographic Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority]] disputes the cause of the crash, blaming mechanical problems rather than any action of Al-Batouti.&lt;ref name=cairo2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecaa&gt;{{cite web |title=Report of Investigation of Accident: EgyptAir 990 |url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110604061959/http://www.ntsb.gov/events/ea990/docket/ecaa_report.pdf |publisher=[[Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]] |date=June 2001 |accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was Western media speculation that Al-Batouti may have been a [[terrorism|terrorist]], although his family and friends indicated that he had no strong political beliefs.&lt;ref name=cairo2/&gt;

==Personal life==
Al-Batouti was married and had five children. The youngest, a daughter who was 10 at the time of the crash, suffered from [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], and was undergoing medical treatment in [[Los Angeles]]. Efforts had been made at EgyptAir, both at a company level and at an employee level, to provide assistance to help defray the medical expenses.&lt;ref name=ntsb4&gt;{{cite web |title=Operational Factors Group Chairman's Factual Report |url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110604061959/http://www.ntsb.gov/events/ea990/docket/Ex_2A.pdf |publisher=[[NTSB]] |date=18 January 2000 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[FBI]] reports, Al-Batouti was a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|promiscuous]] man who often made sexual advances toward [[Maid|maids]] and other women at his New York hotel.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayday/&gt;

&lt;!-- NOTE: The spelling in the article is &quot;Ganon&quot; and not &quot;Gannon&quot;. --&gt;
{{Nihongo|'''Ganon'''|ガノン|Ganon|{{IPAc-en|'|g|æ|n|ə|n}}|lead=yes}},{{efn|The character's name is spelled ''Gannon'' in the [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|original ''The Legend of Zelda'']].}} also known as {{nihongo|'''Ganondorf'''|ガノンドロフ|Ganondorofu|{{IPAc-en|'|g|æ|n|ə|n|d|ɔr|f}}}} in his humanoid form, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the main antagonist in [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' video game series. Ganon is the final [[Boss (video games)|boss]] in many ''Zelda'' titles.

In the games, the character alternates between two forms: a massive, demonic boar-like creature and a tall, heavily-built [[Gerudo]], a race of humanoid desert brigands. Ganondorf is the archenemy of the series' central protagonist, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], and the leader of the Gerudo. His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often involve capturing [[Princess Zelda]] and planning to conquer [[Hyrule]] and the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time | developer = Nintendo | publisher = Nintendo | language=Japanese | quote = '''Rauru''': {{nihongo2|アタシたち　賢者は　六人そろえば　魔王ガノンドロフを　　封印することが　できるの。}} ('If we, the six sages, come together, we will even be able to seal the Demon King Ganondorf.')}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures | developer=Nintendo | publisher = Nintendo | language=Japanese | quote =  '''Ganon''': {{nihongo2|おお...、俺は闇の魔王！！}} ('Graah!

The North American release of ''Ocarina of Time'' uses &quot;Great King of Evil Ganondorf&quot; for his human form while the North American release of ''Twilight Princess'' uses &quot;Dark Lord Ganondorf&quot;. While simply called &quot;Ganon&quot; in in his bestial form, both ''Twilight Princess'' and ''Breath of the Wild'' call him &quot;Dark Beast Ganon&quot;.}} To this end, he seeks the [[Triforce]], a powerful magical relic that grants any wish its bearer desires, and usually manipulates several other villains to realize his ambitions.

In most games, he already possesses the [[Triforce#Triforce of Power|Triforce of Power]], a third of the full Triforce that gives him godlike strength, boundless mystical power and makes him invulnerable to all but the most powerful sacred weapons, such as the [[Master Sword]]. However, Ganondorf's lust for power can never be satisfied. The character has been well received by critics and fans alike, becoming one of the most popular and recognizable villains in gaming.

==Character design==
Ganon has two basic forms that appear throughout the series: one that is his demonic and porcine form, while the other is his humanoid [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Gerudo|Gerudo]] form. In the [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|original ''The Legend of Zelda'']], ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'', [[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages|''Oracle of Seasons'' and ''Oracle of Ages'']], ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures|Four Swords Adventures]]'', and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds|A Link Between Worlds]]'', he is depicted as a blue, porcine biped wielding a trident. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'', his demonic form bears more of a resemblance to a giant [[Minotaur]] while wielding two large swords. This game also marks the first appearance of his humanoid form, a physically imposing and armor-clad Gerudo. He displays physical traits typical of Gerudo: dark skin (with his having an olive green tint), a sharp bird-like nose, amber eyes, and red eyebrows and hair (with the former connecting to the latter). Ganondorf is 230&amp;nbsp;cm (7&amp;nbsp;ft. 6½ in.)&lt;ref&gt;Hyrule Historia&lt;/ref&gt; and towers over Link and other characters. His Gerudo form reappears in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'', albeit noticeably aged with a cloak and two unnamed swords, as well as in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]'' with thicker armor, a glowing white wound in his chest that originated from his failed execution, and the same sword that was used during said execution attempt.

Ganon was originally known as &quot;Hakkai&quot; during development of the original ''The Legend of Zelda'', in reference to a humanoid pig character known as [[Zhu Bajie]] (''Cho Hakkai'' in Japanese) from the famed 16th-century Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks - Zelda Handheld History |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_-_zelda_handheld_history_15603_15604.html#top |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=2010-01-27}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is given the surname &quot;Dragmire&quot; and the alias &quot;Mandrag Ganon&quot;, which means &quot;Ganon of the Enchanted Thieves&quot;, in the English version of the ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'' instruction manual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganon's Name&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Yoshiaki Koizumi  | title = Instruction Booklet (for ''The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past'') | section = The Legend of Hyrule | sectionurl =  | version =  | publisher = Nintendo of America | date = 1992 | url = http://www.zeldalegends.net/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=1274&amp;fullsize=1 | id =  | accessdate =  | quote = &quot;The name of this king of thieves is Ganondorf Dragmire, but he is known by his alias, Mandrag Ganon, which means Ganon of the Enchanted Thieves.&quot; | page = 5 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganon is named inconsistently throughout the series. In the Japanese versions of the first three games, his name is anglicized as &quot;Gannon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Hyrule Fantasy: Zelda no Densetsu]] |developer=[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=1986-02-21 |platform=[[Family Computer Disk System]] |scene=title screen |quote=Many years ago prince darkness Gannon stole one of the Triforce with power.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|The Legend of Zelda 2: Link no Bōken]] |developer=[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=1987-01-14 |platform=[[Family Computer Disk System]] |scene=title screen |quote=Several years after Gannon was destroyed, Link learns from Impa about another sleeping Princess Zelda.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce]] |developer=[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=1991-11-21 |platform=[[Super Famicom]] |scene=staff credits |quote=Level 8 Gannon's Tower}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spelling appears in only two Western releases: the original [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|game]], and the non-canonical ''[[Zelda's Adventure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Zelda's Adventure |developer=Viridis |publisher=Philips Media |date=1994-06-05 |platform=Philips CD-i |quote=Gannon, Lord of Darkness, has taken over Tolemac.

''A Link to the Past'' uses &quot;Ganon&quot;, while ''Ocarina of Time'' predominately uses &quot;Ganondorf&quot;. Nintendo's current convention is to use &quot;Ganon&quot; for his beast form and &quot;Ganondorf&quot; for the character's human form.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

For the development of ''Ocarina of Time'', Ganon was conceived by character designer Satoru Takizawa. Takizawa had imagined Ganon as a &quot;crooked and complex thief, who was basically an all around abominable human being&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1101.com/nintendo/nin1/nin1-6.htm |title=樹の上の秘密基地 |date=26 Nov 1998 |publisher=ほぼ日刊イトイ新聞 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, script director Toru Osawa claimed that this image was &quot;not the case&quot;. He began to speak of how Ganondorf was meant to have &quot;parts where he is rather good&quot;, comparing him to the character of [[Raoh]] in ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ocarina Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Ki no ue no Himitsu kichi Ocarina of Time interview - Osawa and Takizawa comments |url= http://www.angelfire.com/games5/makzelda/interviews/kiootcomments.html|publisher=[[Angelfire]] |accessdate=2009-08-20 |date=1998-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this idea in mind, Takizawa created a tentative model of Ganondorf based on actor [[Christopher Lambert]]. The end result of Ganondorf was very different from this model, with three forms of the character being created: one of Ganondorf in the beginning; one of Ganondorf seven years later, with longer hair; and one of Ganon in the end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ocarina Interview&quot;/&gt; Since Ganon appeared as a boar-like creature, Takizawa decided that Ganondorf should transform into such at the end of the game, despite the opinions of other staff members. He decided on making Ganon a beast &quot;with the feeling of a pig&quot; to reference ''A Link to the Past''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ocarina Interview&quot;/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Ganon is depicted as the ultimate embodiment of pure evil and mindless hatred. His roles range from savage beast to scheming tyrant to godlike entity, sometimes in the course of a single game. The book ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia|Hyrule Historia]]'' reveals that Ganon's hatred is so intense that he can survive even the total obliteration of his body and remain conscious. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Despite these negative traits, he does show some knowledge of the fine arts; most notably, he is shown playing his own [[leitmotif]] on an organ in ''Ocarina of Time''. Ganondorf is incredibly arrogant, believing himself to be completely invulnerable. Because of this, he never considers anything to be a threat and appears to put minimal effort into fighting. Unsurprisingly, Ganondorf is often in total disbelief when he is defeated, once even bursting into laughter from having been outsmarted at the last second. He is not completely beyond sympathy, though; in ''The Wind Waker'', Ganondorf reveals that his motives were not purely selfish, claiming to have sought the Triforce to allow the Gerudo Valley relief from its scorching desert wind. Zelda also expresses pity for him in ''Ocarina of Time'' in his attempt to steal the Triforce when its power was too great for him to control.

He is portrayed in ''Ocarina of Time'' as an ambitious, cunning manipulator, gaining the king's trust before betraying him and tricking Link into opening the Door of Time, which allows him to access the Triforce. In ''Twilight Princess'', Ganondorf is stated to have been known as a demon thief and an evil magic wielder renowned for his ruthlessness. In that same game, it is when he obtains the Triforce of Power that develops a conscienceless [[god complex]], believing himself to have been chosen by the goddesses who created Hyrule to be its ruler. In ''The Wind Waker'', Ganondorf is much older and prepares for the circumstances that led to his prior defeat, ordering the capture of girls that appear similar to Zelda and killing the sages in charge of blessing the Master Sword so that it cannot be used against him.

Ganon is a formidable [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]],{{efn|He uses magic in ''A Link to the Past'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''The Adventure of Link'', among other titles.}} able to use magic to attack as well as [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]],{{efn|He changes between human and beast forms in ''Ocarina of Time'' and ''Twilight Princess''.}} and he is skilled enough a swordsman to combat Link.{{efn|Ganon acrobatically dodges Link's swings in ''The Wind Waker'' and ''Twilight Princess''. In the former, he [[Dual wield|dual-wields]] swords.}} Despite his size, Ganondorf is incredibly agile, and is not only capable of dodging sword attacks but arrows as well. The [[Triforce of Power]], a magical relic of the [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Golden Goddesses|Golden Goddesses]], makes Ganon stronger, also granting him powers such as [[Transvection (flying)|transvection]],{{efn|Ganon flies in ''A Link to the Past'', the TV series ''The Legend of Zelda'', and ''Ocarina of Time''.

In ''Twilight Princess'', while in beast form, he uses [[Portal (fiction)|portals]] to evade attack.}} and [[superhuman strength]].

Further, the Triforce piece grants him [[immortality]]; although he can show signs of aging, such as in ''The Wind Waker'', he is invulnerable to everything but his own magic and sacred weapons such as the Master Sword, the Four Sword, Light Arrows and Silver Arrows.

==Appearances==

===Video games===
Ganon has appeared in most games in the series, some of which hide his existence until late in the game. Ganon made his first appearance in ''The Legend of Zelda''. Ganon invades Hyrule with his minions, stealing the Triforce of Power. To protect the world from Ganon, [[Princess Zelda]] breaks the [[Triforce of Wisdom]] into eight pieces and scatters them across the land, but is then captured. She sends her nursemaid, Impa, to find someone to defeat Ganon. Impa discovers [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]]. He gathers the Triforce pieces and defeats Ganon, reducing him to a pile of ashes and recovering the Triforce of Power. Afterwards, he brings both the Triforces of Power and Wisdom to Zelda. Ganon makes no major appearance in the sequel ''Zelda II: The Adventure of Link'', as it focuses on his minions' attempt to revive him by killing Link and spilling Link's blood over Ganon's ashes. If they succeed, Ganon's silhouette appears on the Game Over screen accompanied by his laugh.

He later appeared in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''A Link to the Past'', trapped in a place called the Dark World—formerly called the Sacred Land, before Ganon corrupted it. The game focuses on Ganon's attempt to escape from the Dark World and conquer the Light World, utilizing minions such as the wizard Agahnim to sacrifice the seven descendants of the sages who sealed him away, in order to break the seal. Zelda summons Link to rescue her, but she is captured and sent to the Dark World. Once Link defeats Agahnim, he is sent to the Dark World, where he rescues the seven maidens, defeats Agahnim yet again, and pursues Ganon into his lair, where Ganon is eventually defeated. Link finds the completed Triforce, and uses it to undo everything Ganon has done. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]]'', Link battles Dethl, a physical manifestation of the Wind Fish's nightmares. During the final battle, Dethl assumes several forms, all of which are based on creatures from Link's past. One of Dethl's forms is &quot;Ganon's Shadow&quot; and is constructed from Link's memories of his battle with Ganon in ''A Link to the Past''.

He makes a major appearance in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' as Ganondorf; in the chronology of the series's story, it is his earliest appearance (Excluding Demise in Skyward Sword). Ganondorf swears his allegiance to the King of Hyrule, in order to betray him and conquer Hyrule Castle. However, the Zelda of the game asks Link to take the Master Sword, a mystical weapon used to defeat evil. After Link finds all the items necessary to take the sword, Zelda and her nursemaid Impa are chased from Hyrule Castle. Once Link opens the door protecting the Master Sword and takes it, he falls into a deep sleep, allowing Ganondorf to steal the Triforce of Power from the room. Seven years later, Link awakens as an adult, and finds Hyrule corrupted by Ganondorf. Link collects the power of the seven sages—including Zelda, who is kidnapped after she reveals herself. He encounters Ganondorf, defeating him and escaping from the castle with Zelda. However, Ganondorf uses the Triforce of Power to turn into his bestial form. Link defeats him with the help of Zelda and the other sages, and Ganon is banished to the Sacred Realm, swearing vengeance against Zelda, the Sages and Link. Ganon does not make an appearance in ''Ocarina of Time''{{'}}s Nintendo 64 sequel ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]'', but was referenced under the word &quot;Evil&quot; in the prologue. His race the Gerudo also make a return as the pirates.

Two [[Game Boy Color]] games, ''Oracle of Seasons'' and ''Oracle of Ages'', do not initially have anything to do with Ganon, but once both are linked together and both are completed, two of Ganon's minions, Koume and Kotake, seek to revive him by using Zelda and two [[oracle]]s called Din and Nayru. Ganon is ultimately revived, but since Zelda was not sacrificed, he becomes a mindless beast and is defeated by Link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Ages | developer=Flagship | publisher=Nintendo | date=2001-05-14 | platform=Game Boy Color |quote='''Zelda:''' Since they could not sacrifice me in their final rite, the powers of darkness could only revive a mindless, raging Ganon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganon does not make an appearance in the subsequent Game Boy Advance game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords|Four Swords]]'', which instead introduces the new recurring villain [[Vaati]].

Ganondorf appears in the [[GameCube]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]''. Following ''Ocarina of Time'', in an alternate timeline, Ganondorf escaped from the Sacred Realm. As the Link of ''Ocarina of Time'' is nowhere to be found, the Hylians pray to the Goddesses to save Hyrule. The Goddesses respond by flooding the land with endless rain in order to destroy Ganondorf, driving the Hylian people to the mountaintops. When he is confronted in his fortress by the new Link, Ganondorf reveals his motives to capture Tetra, who is revealed to be the descendant of the Zelda from ''Ocarina of Time''. After Link fails to defeat Ganondorf in their first encounter, Link finds the Master Sword and battles him in the sunken Hyrule Castle. Ganondorf explains his resentment of Hyrule, describing his country as one that was filled with death and despair, and that Hyrule was rich with life—that being his reason for trying to conquer it. However, before Ganondorf can use the Triforce to revert the flood, the King of Hyrule intervenes and wishes his kingdom to be totally destroyed to make room for the future. Though Ganondorf attempts to kill him and Tetra, Link thrusts the Master Sword into Ganondorf's head, killing him and turning him to stone as Hyrule is fully submerged underwater.

Ganon is largely absent in the ''Four Sword'' subseries. Instead, another power-hungry sorcerer, Vaati, is depicted as the main villain of the subseries. Despite this, Ganon is mentioned in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures|Four Swords Adventures]]'' and makes a late appearance near the very end of the game after having revealed his manipulation of Vaati. As ''Four Swords Adventures'' takes place centuries after ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]'', it is also the first and only game in the series to feature a reincarnation of Ganon. In the game's backstory, Ganondorf was to be the guardian of the Gerudo and the desert but his heart grew twisted with each passing year, and he became obsessed with obtaining power at any cost. Banished by the Gerudo, he retrieved an evil magical Trident from a Pyramid, which transformed him into the bestial Ganon, and then began to usurp power from many others so that he could coat the world in darkness. After Vaati is defeated, Link and Zelda battle Ganon and seal him away within the Four Sword.

In ''Twilight Princess'', Ganondorf appears in flashback midway through the game, though he is behind all of the events of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|date=2005-08-16|url= http://cube.ign.com/articles/683/683158p1.html|title=Twilight Princess: Ganon's Return|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the events of the game, revealed by the ''Hyrule Historia'' to be an alternate timeline where his deception is exposed, Ganondorf was captured by the Sages and condemned to death. As he was the bearer of the Triforce of Power, the Sages were unable to kill Ganondorf as he broke his chains and killed the Sage of Water while claiming the Sword of the Sages for himself.  The Sages were forced to banish Ganondorf to the Twilight Realm, where he presented himself as a demonic [[deity]] to [[Zant]], delegating his power and persuading him to attempt conquest of the light world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess | developer=Nintendo EAD | publisher=Nintendo | date=2006-11-19 | platform=Wii |quote='''Zant:''' It was then, in the thrall of hatred and despair, that I turned my eyes to the heavens...and found a god. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess | developer=Nintendo EAD | publisher=Nintendo | date=2006-11-19 | platform=Wii |quote='''Zant:''' My god had only one wish....To merge shadow and light...and make darkness! }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganondorf does not appear again until the end of the game—in the throne of Hyrule Castle, proclaiming it as his own. He is challenged by [[Midna]], prompting Ganondorf to possess the soulless Princess Zelda and attack Link before leaving her body and transforming into a feral version of Ganon. Midna recovers and teleports Link and Zelda to Hyrule Field before attempting to defeat Ganondorf when he reconstitutes himself, causing the castle to explode. But Ganondorf defeats Midna, appearing on horseback to fight Link before engaging him in a final duel where he uses the Sages' sword. Link defeats Ganondorf, impaling him through the wound in his chest with the Master Sword. After getting up and uttering a few words,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess | developer=Nintendo EAD | publisher=Nintendo | date=2006-11-19 | platform=Wii |quote='''Ganondorf:''' Do not think this ends here... The history of Light and Shadow will be written in blood! }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Triforce symbol on Ganondorf's hand disappears as he dies standing in place.

In the Nintendo DS game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass|Phantom Hourglass]]'', the direct sequel to ''The Wind Waker'', Ganondorf appears in a cameo in the opening sequence that summarizes the plot of the latter game. However, he is not seen or even mentioned in any capacity in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks|Spirit Tracks]]'' (save for the Demon Train which has a face that heavily resembles Ganondorf), the direct sequel to ''Phantom Hourglass''.

While Ganondorf does not make an appearance in the Wii game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword|Skyward Sword]]'', his origin is foreshadowed. Demon King Demise, the main villain of the game, curses Link and Zelda before his impending death and states that his curse (Curse of the Demon Tribe in the Japanese version) will see his hatred towards the descendants of Link and Zelda be reborn in an endless cycle. This curse ultimately comes to pass when Demise's hatred manifests in physical form as none other than Ganondorf himself.

In the Nintendo 3DS game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds|A Link Between Worlds]]'', Ganon makes a short appearance in his normal form, though his past actions and influence greatly affect the course of events throughout the story and serves as the inspiration for Yuga. Yuga summons him back from his seal with the power of the seven sages, previously trapped within paintings by Yuga, and absorbs Ganon to take his power as his own. Becoming Yuga Ganon, Yuga reveals plans to complete the Triforce once again and remake both Lorule and Hyrule in his own image, but is defeated in this by Link. Ganon is also mentioned by several characters and old legends, which describe his actions during the events of ''A Link to the Past'', and his prior invasion between the events of ''Link's Awakening'' and ''A Link Between Worlds''.

An incarnation of Ganon appears in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', by this time known only as the evil entity Calamity Ganon. Mentioned to have have terrorized Hyrule for ten millennia, causing the then-advanced civilization to dwindle back to its medieval state, Ganon forced opposition when the kingdom of Hyrule uncovered their ancestors' lost technology and attempt to use it in preparation for his return. But Ganon turned the Guardian robots against the Hyrulians while having creatures created from his being take over the Divine Beasts while killing the champions chosen to use them. This forced Zelda to use her power to seal Ganon, which lasted for a century with the ruined kingdom ravaged by nature over time. But Ganon continued to grow in power while trapped, with Zelda awakening her knight Link from his slumber to stop Ganon before he can break free and destroy the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild | developer=Nintendo EAD | publisher=Nintendo | date=2016-06-14 | platform='''Wii U/NX''' |quote='''Old Man:''' I assume you have caught full sight of that atrocity swarming around the castle.

===Other appearances===
Ganon appears in his &quot;demon boar&quot; form in two of the three [[CD-i games from The Legend of Zelda series|CD-i ''Zelda'' titles]]: ''Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon'' and ''Link: The Faces of Evil''. In ''Zelda's Adventure'', he is a large, muscular devil-creature. In the first two of these games, he only requires one hit to defeat, and appears to be a sorcerer of some sort with features based on his cartoon incarnation.

Ganondorf made his first playable appearance as an unlockable character in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' (where he is based on his appearance in the [[Nintendo Space World]] demo, even wielding the large, cleaver-like sword in one of his victory poses though he cannot actually use it in combat)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2001-11-26|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/100/100084p1.html|title=Super Smash Bros.

Brawl]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' (both using his ''Twilight Princess'' design). He is one of five characters from the ''Zelda'' series to be playable in each game. In each game, he is a slower, heavier, and more powerful &quot;clone&quot; of [[Captain Falcon]], performing mostly the same attacks and moves. Eiji Aonuma said that his design team submitted designs for Ganon based on ''Twilight Princess'' to the developers of ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-08-02|url= http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0802.1741.54921.htm|title=Eiji Aonuma Talks DS Development And More|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=2007-08-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818043426/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0802.1741.54921.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganon appears in the single-player ''The Subspace Emissary'' mode, allied with [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] and [[Wario]] (in which, near the end they leave Tabuu's side to join [[Mario]]'s side) as well as being a servant of [[Super Smash Bros. (series)#Non-playable characters|Master Hand]]. His Final Smash is his &quot;Dark Beast: Ganon&quot; form from ''Twilight Princess'', in which he transforms, charges across the screen, and then warps himself back onto the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/hidden09.html|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!!|title=Ganondorf in Super Smash Bros. Brawl|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganondorf appears as a playable character in the ''Zelda'' spin-off title ''[[Hyrule Warriors]]'', revealed to be permanently sealed when his soul was divided into five fragments by a previous Link and placed in separates eras in time. But one fragment of Ganon's soul was freed by the overseer Cia, corrupting her into a dark sorceress to have her create an army to gather the Triforce and use its power to retrieve areas across time where the rest of his soul is imprisoned. But Ganondorf's act to purging Cia of her light created the White Sorceress Lana as she helps Link and Zelda. When Ganondorf regained four fifths of his former self, he restore his physical body so he can take the Triforce from. But Cia returns the Triforces of Wisdom and Courage back to their original bearers, while temporary sealing him away. Following Cia's defeat, Ganondorf regains the final fragment of his soul and is fully revived, though without the Triforce of Power, which was claimed by Lana. He then leads a campaign composing of himself and the summoned Ghirahim and Zant to gain the complete Triforce. Though he succeeds in obtaining the complete Triforce, his over confidence causes him to underestimate his enemies, who dispose of Zant and Ghirahim, before engaging Ganondorf himself at Ganon's Tower. Ganondorf is defeated, though he uses the Triforce to revive himself as the Dark Beast Ganon, however is defeated, allowing Link, Zelda, and Lana to reclaim their respective Triforce pieces. Using the combined Triforce, the three reseal Ganon. Princess Zelda and Link return the Master Sword to its pedestal to completely restore the seal on Ganondorf's soul.

Ganondorf is available as an unlockable &quot;Mystery Mushroom&quot; costume in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]''.

===Appearances in other media===
Ganon was the main villain of 1989's [[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|''The Legend of Zelda'' cartoon]], which was shown as part of ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' in syndication that year. In the cartoon, Ganon was a brown-skinned [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] wild boar and a wizard. He was in possession of the Triforce of Power, and—despite having seemingly endless abilities and magical powers—lost every chance to steal the Triforce of Wisdom. He spent most of his time living in his subterranean lair, referred to as his &quot;castle&quot;, which was located in the [[Underworld]]. He is disintegrated when attacked several times by Link's sword, Zelda's arrows, or the Triforce of Wisdom. He was voiced by [[Len Carlson]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In addition to the ''Zelda'' cartoon, Ganon (along with Link and Zelda) also appeared in ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'', as a secondary villain in the episode &quot;Quest for the Potion of Power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Quest for the Potion of Power |series=Captain N: The Game Master |serieslink=Captain N: The Game Master |network=NBC |airdate=1990-09-29 |number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was something of a continuation of Ganon's appearance in the ''Zelda'' cartoon. The episode uses elements from ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''The Adventure of Link''. During the episode, Ganon is revived, double-crosses [[Metroid (series)|Mother Brain]], and is killed again by the reflected magic on Link's shield.

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode &quot;[[Imaginationland Episode III]],&quot; Ganondorf is seen as one of many evil characters battling the good characters. In the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode &quot;Shoe&quot;, Ganon appears briefly but is killed by Link, who frees Zelda shortly afterward.

Ganondorf also makes an appearance in [[The Legend of Zelda (manga)|''The Legend of Zelda'' manga]].

==Reception==
Ganon is one of the most recognizable and popular villains in gaming and has been met with positive reception over the years. In 2010, ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' named him the best villain in Nintendo history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= 250 Reasons To Love Nintendo|url=http://www.nintendopower.com/images/NP250_250Feature.pdf |format=Magazine |accessdate=2010-07-17 |volume=250 |date=January 2010 |pages=42, 47 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[GamesRadar]] ranked him as the best villain in the entire history of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-100-villains-video-games/|title=100 best villains in video games|publisher=GamesRadar |author=GamesRadar Staff|date=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 2007 Andrew Gordon of [[Cracked.com]] listed Ganondorf from ''Twilight Princess'' among the six most disappointing video game end bosses, writing &quot;We went into this battle expecting [[Darth Maul]], and what we got was [[C-3PO]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_15712_the-6-most-disappointing-video-game-end-bosses_p2.html|title=The 6 Most Disappointing Video Game End Bosses|publisher=Cracked.com|first=Andrew|last=Gordon|date=December 12, 2007|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gao Jianli''' (Chinese: 高漸離) was a citizen of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], a [[China|Chinese]] state during the [[Warring States period]], and a player of the lute (a stringed musical instrument played with a thin stick). After [[Jing Ke]] was killed in his assassination attempt on [[Qin Shi Huang]], Gao changed his name and became an assistant in a wine shop as Qin Shi Huang retaliated against all friends of Jing Ke. As the work was strenuous, Gao would often pace around the house of the owner of the wine shop listening to the guests playing the lute in the owner's house. He would commend about the playing until one day when someone told the owner what Gao said about his guests' skills in playing the lute.

The owner asked Gao to play for him and his skillful play won him the heart of the owner. Qin Shi Huang heard about the event and decided to summon Gao to play for him. Someone recognised Gao and told Qin Shi Huang about his real identity. Because of his love of music, Qin Shi Huang decided to pardon Gao but not before making him blind.

The skill of Gao won him praises from Qin Shi Huang and after a few performances the Emperor lost his guarding of Gao, who  began to move nearer and nearer to him. Gao sensed the movement and secretly hid lead pieces in the instrument, when the Emperor is within striking distance, Gao took a strike but missed. Gao was subsequently executed and Qin Shi Huang stopped being close to people from the other states.

'''''Garage Kids''''' is a [[France|French]] animated [[television pilot]] that was produced by [[MoonScoop Group#Antefilms Production|Antefilms]] in 2001 in both France and US.  It was the original concept for the French [[animated television series]] ''[[Code Lyoko]]'', which was released in 2003 in France and 2004 in the US.

== Original concept ==
''Garage Kids'' was originally intended to be the name and concept for ''Code Lyoko''. They decided to switch to the current name and concept instead of sticking with what is seen in the five-minute pilot. The original hook of the series is seen below. Most of it is still true of ''Code Lyoko'', except for some minor details.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Built on the model of a soap opera which unfolds through the series, ''Garage Kids'' offers in each of its 26 episodes of 26 minutes a complete story in which [[Odd Della Robbia|Odd]] and his friends &amp;ndash; [[Yumi Ishiyama|Yumi]], [[Ulrich Stern|Ulrich]] and also [[Jeremie Belpois|Jeremie]], a computer wizard &amp;ndash; try to end one of the disturbances in the computer network caused by Xanadu's exuberance. While the idea of clandestine natures and hidden identities should seduce the children while feeding their imaginations, ''Garage Kids'' rests on the fascination that video games hold for kids today. A confrontation between the real world and Xanadu fully vindicates that of 2D and of 3D. Influenced by the poetry and the visual impact of Japanese animation, the series proposes a graphic universe that's particularly original and strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.codelyoko.net/FRA/Garage_Kids/Garage_Kids.pdf |title=Promotional document for ''Garage Kids'' }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(798&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} Page 2, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Original plot ==
This is the original plot for ''Garage Kids''. Much of this still holds true for ''Code Lyoko'', though various names and places have been altered.

A group of kids whose adventures take place in the real world but also in a parallel and virtual world, Xanadu. A boy of about twelve years old, [[Odd Della Robbia|Odd]], arrives one day in his new neighborhood and quickly understands that his new three friends are gifted with extraordinary [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction|abilities]]. [[Yumi Ishiyama|Yumi]], for example, possess unusually strong [[telekinesis]] while [[Ulrich Stern|Ulrich]] has the gift of [[Superhuman speed|displacing himself at the speed of light]]. These kids have in fact penetrated the secret of Xanadu, the fruit of the labors of a research group whose laboratory, set in an environment inspired by the old Renault automobile [[Factory (Code Lyoko)|factory]] on the Île Seguin at Boulogne-Billancourt, is now abandoned. Created by the Professor, a learned eccentric who sunk into madness, Xanadu and its multiple disturbances threaten to destroy the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.codelyoko.net/FRA/Garage_Kids/Garage_Kids.pdf |title=Promotional document for ''Garage Kids'' }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(798&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} Page 2, paragraph 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== ''Garage Kids'' and ''Code Lyoko'' ==
''Garage Kids'' is similar in many ways to ''Code Lyoko'', but several stark differences exist, as well.  The differences are seen in the minor details, such as outfits and backgrounds, and the generally darker mood and atmosphere, which can be especially seen within the factory. The similarities can be seen in the larger details, such as the overall theme and characters involved.

[[Lyoko]] is portrayed quite differently in ''Garage Kids'', being called &quot;Xanadu&quot; instead.  The [[antagonist]] appeared and acted very much like [[Xana (Code Lyoko)|Xana]] in ''Code Lyoko'', but was given no name in ''Garage Kids''.  The three main fighters, such as Yumi with her unusually strong [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]], were able to exert their special abilities and superpowers outside of Lyoko. [[Aelita (Code Lyoko)|Aelita]] does not seem to exist in ''Garage Kids'', and no character models of her were ever made.

Many of the locations are different, as well.  Inside the [[Factory (Code Lyoko)|factory]], the scanners (which are much wider and shorter than the ones in the show) are atop a long set of stairs and the lab (simply a chair surrounded by multiple screens) is on ground level.  The exterior of the factory does not appear to be changed.  [[Kadic Junior High School|Kadic]] looks different (looking more like a Japanese junior high/high school in most respects) and pets are seemingly allowed there, since Odd makes absolutely no effort to hide the fact that [[List of Code Lyoko characters#Kiwi|Kiwi]] is with him.

The outfits for the virtualized characters range from slightly to drastically different, appearing to be based on designs from the older eras of [[Japan]].  Ulrich's outfit has the most differences.  Unlike his outfit in ''Code Lyoko'', his pants are rather large and puffy (not like [[parachute pants]]), based on early versions of [[samurai]] armor.  The others are not seen in virtualized form, but early character models shown them in roughly the same outfits as they wear in ''Code Lyoko'', but with minor differences.  The various character models (except for Odd's virtual form) can be seen at the links below.

Different voice actors are used in ''Garage Kids''.  As a result, the character's voices are noticeably different.  They are also less than fluent in English, which is easily spotted in fragments of their conversations.  All the voices sound much more like French voices.  They also sound much younger (around 9–11 years of age).  Their personalities, however, seem to remain the same.

The overall state of the computer-generated imagery in ''Garage Kids'' is poorly executed, in almost second-rate video-game starkness, when compared to the smooth, realistic ''Code Lyoko'' [[computer-generated imagery]]; this is not terribly surprising, as the pilot was never meant to be viewed by the public.  Also, some of the visual effects used in [[anime]] are used in ''Garage Kids'', but, with the exception of one scene in the episode &quot;Claustrophobia,&quot; no anime effects are seen in ''Code Lyoko''.

''Garage Kids'' is not on any of the official ''Code Lyoko'' DVD box sets.  Instead, it is available for download in QuickTime Movie format at the websites below.

== Synopsis ==
''Garage Kids'' begins on a stormy night in the city. A computer in a random room (it looks like a dorm room at Kadic, albeit with a more roomier look and a higher [[bed]]) lights up with a strange symbol (a silhouette of Xanadu) and dark, ghost-like shapes begin to pour from the screen.

The next day, a bus arrives at Kadic. It drops off a student and his dog. They're named Odd and [[List of Code Lyoko characters#Kiwi|Kiwi]], respectively. Odd is greeted by [[Jeremie Belpois|Jeremie]], who also introduces him to his friend, [[Ulrich Stern|Ulrich]].  Jeremie makes a comment about Kiwi, saying something about him looking &quot;really dumb.&quot;  Odd claims Kiwi is very sensitive and can get mean, and pushes the dog into Jeremie's face. Jeremie believes him at first, but Odd quickly reveals the act to be a joke (showing off his goofball smile).  Ulrich just shakes his head in disbelief. Some time later, while showing Odd around the school, Jeremie points out [[Yumi Ishiyama|Yumi]], who is practicing [[Pencak Silat]] with Ulrich. Jeremie makes sure to point out that getting on her bad side is not a good idea.  As the two practice, Yumi eventually throws Ulrich to the floor and pins him.  After a short stint of heavy breathing, Yumi blushes.

Later on, on the roof of Kadic, Yumi is telling Jeremie to hurry before they are late for class. For some unfathomable reason, Jeremie is sitting on the railing. He's messing with his laptop, claiming something to be weird.  All of a sudden, the symbol seen on the computer in the first scene appears on his laptop and the same ghosts burst from the screen and escape into the sky. This causes Jeremie to lose his balance and fall. Luckily, Yumi is able to catch him before he hits the ground.  She doesn't catch him physically, but rather through [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. Odd is understandably surprised as she telekinetically floats Jeremie back up. She then asks Odd, who is now trembling and rather scared, &quot;Odd, can you keep a secret?&quot;

They take Odd (followed by Kiwi) to an old [[Factory (Code Lyoko)|factory]]. Within is a giant laboratory, complete with a large supercomputer, three scanners, and a couch for some reason.  Ulrich heads for the scanners while Jeremie and Yumi head for the supercomputer. Odd just stands there, in awe of his surroundings. Jeremie quickly sends Ulrich to a virtual world known as Xanadu.  Odd wonders what is happening, so Yumi gives a quick explanation about Xanadu. They don't know why it exists, but that they do know something is dangerously wrong with it.

In Xanadu, Ulrich walks around aimlessly for a bit before giant black ghosts begin to chase him.  As the chase takes place, Odd asks why they go if it's so dangerous. Yumi explains that their world is in danger as well.  Back in Xanadu, a ghost tries to crash into Ulrich.  He dodges, and the ghost crashes into a pillar instead. A subsequent earthquake in the real world helps to accentuate Yumi's earlier point.

Eventually, Jeremie informs Ulrich that his saber is charged. Ulrich then draws a blue saber made out of [[binary code]]. He quickly cuts one of the ghosts into several pieces. The other ghosts retreat, with Ulrich in hot pursuit. He chases them up a large mountain, eventually stopping at an oversized [[Tower (Code Lyoko)|tower]].  A few dozen ghosts are circling it. They break off and begin to pursue him.

Back in the lab, Jeremie tells Ulrich to come back, since it is getting too dangerous.  Yumi disagrees, saying they can't go back later, and has Odd come with her to Xanadu instead.  They appear on top of one of the oversized towers, but are not actually seen.  The camera backs up to show the whole of Xanadu, which looks exactly the same as the symbol seen on Jeremie's laptop.  Towers of varying sizes can be seen scattered about its landscape and the &quot;island&quot; (which Xanadu is on) is connected by massive cables running into a black abyss. The ''Garage Kids'' logo appears on the screen once it fully backs away. Odd then comes out of the scanner, exhausted from the experience.

Now the credits start to play, showing various still images of the group. Among these are the four sitting on a bench while Jeremie works on his laptop, Jeremie and Odd trying to push an embarrassed Ulrich and Yumi together, a scene with Jeremie working and Odd sleeping while Ulrich and Yumi have a pillow fight, and, finally, another scene with the four sitting on a bench.

== Music ==
* The song in the ending credits is called ''[[Love Foolosophy]]'' by the English group called [[Jamiroquai]]. It is available on the album called ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]''.
* The background music is called &quot;Pirates&quot; by [[Randy Edelman]]. The music is also used for the movie &quot;[[Six Days Seven Nights]]&quot;.

'''Gareth Sewell Penn''' (born 1941) is an American true crime [[author]] and amateur [[detective]] known for being among the first non-journalists to write about the [[Zodiac Killer]] case.  He published a theory about the killer's motives, publicly accused a noted UC Berkeley public policy professor of the crimes, and labeled himself a one-time suspect.

Reviewing the 2007 [[David Fincher]] film ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'' for the ''Las Vegas Weekly'', [[Mike D'Angelo]] wrote, &quot;I think the movie erred in selecting author [[Robert Graysmith]] as its source and nominal protagonist.  Zodiac buffs know well that the true obsessive is a fellow named Gareth Penn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D'Angelo, Mike (March 1, 2007). [http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/archive/2007/mar/01/magnificent-obsession &quot;Magnificent obsession: 'Zodiac' finds glory in investigative details&quot;]. ''[[Las Vegas Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Penn graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1962 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree (BA) in [[Germanic language]]s and again in 1965 with a [[Master of Arts]] (MA) in [[Medieval]] [[Germanic language]]s.  He received a [[Master of Library Science]] (MLS) from U.C. Berkeley in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn, Gareth 1987&quot;/&gt;

In 1965, Penn entered the [[United States Army]] in [[Berlin, Germany]] and received basic training at [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]].  He received artillery survey training at [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma]], where he became an [[List of United States Army careers#Field Artillery Branch .28FA.29|Artillery Surveyor]] Instructor. He received the [[National Defense Service Medal]] and the designation of [[Marksmanship Badge (United States)|Expert Rifle Marksman]]. In 1967, Penn moved back to [[Berkeley, California]], where he was transferred to the [[Army reserves]].  He was [[honorably discharged]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn, Gareth 1987&quot;&gt;*Penn, Gareth, ''Times 17: The Amazing Story of the Zodiac Murders in California and Massachusetts, 1966-1981'' (The Foxglove Press, CA, April 1987). ISBN 0-9618494-0-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Writing===
Penn's writing, mostly focused on the Zodiac case, was largely published in the ''[[The Ecphorizer]]'', the newsletter of the San Francisco chapter of [[Mensa International]], which had a peak readership of 700 and was published between 1981 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecphorizer.com/EPS/site_inside.php?page=5|The Ecphorizer], Ecphorizer.com, George Towner&lt;/ref&gt; A 1972 piece he wrote while attending UC Berkeley, ''[[Gottfried von Strassburg]] and the Invisible Art'' was published in the peer-reviewed journal of Germanic studies [[Colloquia Germanica]]. The piece is a reflection on the legend of [[Tristan]], a 12th-century hero of [[Celtic mythology|Celtic folklore]].

Penn says his father, Hugh Scott Penn, who had been a [[U.S. Army]] [[cryptographer]] during [[World War II]], introduced him to the [[Zodiac killer|Zodiac case]] while he was working for the [[California Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn, Gareth 1987&quot;/&gt;

Penn wrote two self-published books: ''Times 17: The Amazing Story of the Zodiac Murders in California and Massachusetts, 1966-1981'' released in 1987;&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn, Gareth 1987&quot;/&gt; and ''The Second Power:  A Mathematical Analysis of the letters attributed to the Zodiac murderer and supplement to Times 17'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michael, ''[http://weeklyscientist.blogspot.com/2009/10/with-malice-aforethought.html With Malice Aforethought]'', Weekly Scientist&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zodiac Killer===
Gareth Penn started writing about the Zodiac case in a 1981 article for ''California Magazine'' entitled ''Portrait of the Artist as a Mass Murderer.''&lt;ref&gt;''California Magazine'', November 1981, pp. 111-114, 166-170&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Portrait'', Penn theorized that the Zodiac crime scenes were selected by the killer in order to create a geometric shape over the surface of the [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area]] as a sort of &quot;murderous art project.&quot; Part of Penn's commentary about that theory included the observation that, &quot;Other artists had sought to remove their work from the ordinary human perspective. Zodiac trumped them all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Penn, Gareth ''Portrait of the Artist as a Mass Murderer'', ''California Magazine'' November 1981, pp. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn then spent the better part of two decades publicly accusing University of California, Berkeley public policy professor Michael O’Hare of the Zodiac murders.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hare, Michael (May/June 2009). [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0905.ohare.html &quot;Confessions of a Non–Serial Killer&quot;]. ''[[Washington Monthly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusation against Michael O'Hare====
Starting around 1981, Penn began publicly accusing [[University of California, Berkeley]] public policy professor Michael O’Hare of the Zodiac murders in amateur newsletters and self-published books.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michael, [http://weeklyscientist.blogspot.com/2009/10/with-malice-aforethought.html With Malice Aforethought], ''Weekly Scientist''&lt;/ref&gt; Penn openly accused O'Hare on at least two occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, Kevin. &quot;Author links Harvard professor to Webster case&quot; Beverly, Mass. Times, 12 June 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fehrnstrom, Eric. &quot;Author Targets Harvard Lecturer in Zodiac Case&quot; Boston Herald, 29 October 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for these accusations was Penn's cryptographic analysis of a Zodiac letter, which he claimed yielded the name &quot;Mike O.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecphorizer.com/EPS/site_page.php?page=689&amp;issue=43 One Zero Zero]&lt;/ref&gt; He also accused O'Hare of the murder of Joan Webster, a graduate architecture student at Harvard who disappeared in 1981 and whose remains were found near Boston in 1990. Penn argued that a &quot;geometric design&quot; yielded similarities between the Webster murder and the Zodiac killings in California. On that basis, he accused O'Hare of murdering Webster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecphorizer.com/EPS/site_page.php?page=741&amp;issue=47 The Geometry of Jane Brewster]&lt;/ref&gt; 
O'Hare denied being involved in any murder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamesobrien.cc/index.php?page=stories&amp;family=journalism&amp;category=BostonNOW-col-_Unsolved_Mysteries&amp;archives=show&amp;display=99 Unsolved Mysteries]. BostonNOW&lt;/ref&gt; and has written about his strange experience.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hare, Michael [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0905.ohare.html''Confessions of a Non–Serial Killer'']&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Hare filed an FBI complaint against Penn and in May 1981, the Bureau investigated Penn for possible extortion. According to FBI memos, an agent “contacted Penn by telephone and told him that if he was responsible for the correspondence to [O'Hare] he should immediately cease and desist, pointing out that it could jeopardize any investigation and he could possibly be subject to both civil and criminal penalties.&quot;{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In a May 1981 meeting with FBI agents, Penn &quot;freely admitted sending material to [O'Hare] but stated he had no intent to extort anything.{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/zodiac.htm &quot;Zodiac Killer Files&quot;].

==Cryptography Blog==
Penn continues writing about the case, maintaining a narrative blog entitled D550.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, Gareth (May 24, 2010). [http://d550.blogspot.com/ &quot;the jig is up&quot;]. D550. [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]. Retrieved March 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garganta''' is a fictional [[comic book]] character published by [[AC Comics]] appearing in several of their titles, most commonly ''[[Femforce]]'' the title in which she debuted in 1990 (''Garganta, the {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} Woman'', ''Femforce'' #30). Originally appearing as a one-off antagonist, she proved so popular with readers that she re-appeared two issues later and eventually became a regular character. In 2001, Garganta appeared her own comic book ''[[Garganta's Thrilling Science]]''. A [[live-action]] movie entitled ''[[Gargantarama]]'', starring [[Brenna Barry]] as Garganta, was released on DVD in February 2006. A sequel, ''[[Ghost of Garganta]]'', was released December 14, 2010.
A remake of the first movie was released in 2016
Storylines have exploited Garganta's size-changing ability as both a blessing and as a curse. Although she can usually regulate her size by mental effort, she sometimes experiences uncontrolled growth and causes havoc (this tends to happen when she becomes angry). She is for the most part gentle and friendly and uses her giant size to help others. Because her powers would destroy her normal clothes, she wears only her Span-XX [[bikini]].

==Fictional character biography==

Garganta's real name is  Dr. Carol Heisler. Born in [[Yuma, Arizona]] on January 12, 1919, she became a biochemist and later worked as a U.S. government research scientist working on the V-47 formula that gave [[Miss Victory]] and her daughter their powers. Carol took the formula herself and destroyed the complex where she was working and began to rampage out of control because she could not control the energy in her. After being knocked out by the second Miss Victory (who was leading the team at the time) she grew to gigantic proportions and continued her rampage, eventually being stopped by a combined attack that knocked all the energy out of her. Carol again grew to a giant and rampaged after unwillingly being subjected to an electro-stimulation experiment. This time she escaped to the sea and displayed a new ability to adapt to her surroundings becoming a giant whale-like sea creature. Miss Victory was dispatched to kill her with a special gun, but after Garganta telepathically told her how peaceful she was, she faked Garganta's death for her. (''Femforce'' #30 and 32)

Garganta was returned to human form by the Gammazons, a race of giant alien Amazon women, which left her {{convert|50|ft|m}} tall with the mind of a passive sea mammal. She was abducted along with several other characters but was saved at the climax of the story (''Femforce'' #43 and 44). After the Gammazons were vanquished, Garganta was given a special bikini by Span-XX (who make all of Femforce's costumes) and a special apartment in a giant prefabricated building in the Femforce HQ (''Femforce'' #45) but she later gained the ability to grow and shrink at will through practice.

In a later storyline, Garganta came under the influence of rich socialite [[Stella Stargaze]], who exploited her—firstly as a movie actress and later as a telepathic healer. However, when she attempted to &quot;heal&quot; a man who had been involved in [[seal hunting]], she went wild and started growing in her nightmares. She was rescued by the Femforce and recuperated on a remote island. [[Tara Fremont|Tara]] managed to get her away from the complex with her untested growth abilities.

==Name==

Garganta's name was given to her by Ellen McFarland, a reporter who covered her initial rampage, and comes from the adjective ''[[gargantuan]]'' (&quot;huge&quot; or &quot;vast&quot;). This is itself derived from ''[[Gargantua]]'', a fictional giant created by [[François Rabelais]] which in turn comes from the [[French language|French]] ''gorge'' (&quot;throat&quot;), an aptronym expressive the character's enormous appetite.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Ff64.jpg|thumb|150px|Garganta with [[Tara Fremont]].]]

Primarily Garganta has the power to increase her size, typically to {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}, though she can grow to over {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and lift over 160 tons. She has since learned she has empathic abilities which were in fact the cause of her earlier rampages. Garganta has also been given various other powers. Initially she could shoot destructive beams from her eyes and hands. She then displayed an ability to breathe [[underwater]] while [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], and furthermore to adapt to her ocean surroundings and even mutate to fit them, becoming a giant sea-creature and speaking [[telepathic]]ally. None of these powers have been used since.

==Influence==
The [[giantess]] has become a recurring motif in ''[[Femforce]]'' throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Following the success of Garganta, the [[superheroines]] Synn and [[Nightveil]] were revealed to have size-changing ability, due to the reality-altering nature of their powers. Also Jungle-Girl [[Tara Fremont|Tara]] (who had previously had no super-powers at all) acquired the ability to become a giantess (''[[Good Girl Art Quarterly]]'' Summer 1991), though unlike Garganta she cannot maintain her giant size indefinitely.

Giantess stories have become the theme of the ongoing ''Femforce'' backup feature, ''Gargantarama,'' which takes its name from Garganta herself.

Garganta should not be confused with [[Giganta]], a similar (though less benign) character in the [[DC Comics]] universe.

'''Garokk''' (also known as the '''Petrified Man''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=February 2016}}
Garokk first appeared in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' vol. 1 #2 (November 1970) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Garokk was originally a sailor from [[Great Britain]], whose ship the ''H.M.S. Drake'' crashed on the shores of [[Antarctica]] during the 15th century. The sailor was swept overboard and taken by a warm stream to the [[Savage Land]]. Wandering the Savage Land, the sailor entered the lands of the [[Savage Land#Savage Land races|Sun People]], who worshipped the Sun god Garokk. The sailor found a statue of Garokk with a cup beneath it. Thirsty, the sailor drank from the cup, but was chased off by the Sun People. The sailor escaped and managed to return to the [[Kingdom of England]], but found that he had become immortal after drinking the potion. Over time, the sailor's body became a living, organic, stone-like substance until he looked identical to the statue of Garokk. Nearly five centuries after he had left, the sailor returned to the Savage Land and discovered that the Sun People believed that their god would return and their high priestess [[Zaladane|Zala]] waged war as a form of worship to him. The sailor, now known as the Petrified Man encountered [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] and related his story to Ka-Zar. The Petrified Man allied himself with Ka-Zar and journeyed with him to the Savage Land to prevent his worshippers from waging war there. The Petrified Man gained energy powers, and transformed into pure energy. The Petrified Man managed to stop Zala and her people by dissolving their weapons, and then returned to his physical form. However, the Petrified Man then went mad and believed himself to be Garokk himself. Garokk sought to destroy all life on Earth to bring about peace, and he and Ka-Zar fought each other. On Zala's instructions, Ka-Zar lured him inside an underground pool which turned Garokk human and mortal again. His age caught up with him rapidly and he died shortly afterwards. As he died of extreme old age, he recovered his sanity and then his corpse turned to ash.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 1 #2-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Zala later captured an adventurer called '''Kirk Marston''' and magically resurrected Garokk in the body of Kirk Marston using the ashes of the deceased previous Petrified Man. Marston's body quickly transformed into a duplicate of Garokk's own. With Zaladane, Garokk attempted to unite the Savage Land tribes by forcing them to erect a colossal city for them. Garokk and Zala fought the [[X-Men]] and Ka-Zar; Garokk was defeated by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and fell down into the city's thermal shaft.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #115-116&lt;/ref&gt; The X-Men believed Garokk to be dead. The X-Men's enemy [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] later found Garokk, who had transformed: he was larger and half his body had turned into crystal while the other half became like molten rock, and his intelligence was dulled. Magneto forced Garokk to serve as the guardian of his Antarctic base. In this role, he fought the X-Man [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], but again fell in a deep pit.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #149&lt;/ref&gt;

Again Garokk survived and he returned to his normal size and appearance. When the Savage Land was destroyed by the alien [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], Terminus was defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], his armor ruptured and Terminus himself left to die, but it turned out that this Terminus was just an impostor. Garokk found a suit of Terminus armor and under mental control (presumably by the real Terminus) entered it and started destroying the remainder of the Savage Land. The X-Men fought this &quot;Terminus&quot; and destroyed the armor to reveal Garokk. Garokk regained his free will and together with a machine made by the [[High Evolutionary]], he restored the tropical environment to the Savage Land. This process infused Garokk's essence into the land, causing him to cease to exist as an individual entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

Garokk returned years later as an enemy of Ka-Zar, but Ka-Zar defeated him&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Annual '97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' vol. 2 #20&lt;/ref&gt;

Garokk later appeared in the Savage Land, observing as the High Evolutionary took a number of newly mutated Zebra People children.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #12&lt;/ref&gt; He then led the Avengers to the High Evolutionary's hidden base.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #13 (Aug 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
A human is transformed into a manifestation of Garokk by the mutagenic effects of liquid from the fiery underground pool in the Savage Land. Garokk's skin and much, perhaps all, of his body tissue are transformed into organic, stone-like substances, giving him gray skin that seems rock-like and &quot;petrified&quot; in appearance. He has superhuman stamina and his petrified body also makes him difficult to injure. Garokk has the ability to project tremendous amounts of heat, light, and concussive force from his eyes. He can tap into other energy sources to replenish his own powers.  Garokk has the ability to create dimensional warps with the energy projected from his eyes, and is capable of transporting an entire city through one of these dimensional portals. He has the ability to change his size and transform into a being of pure energy, and then back into his stone-like physical form at will{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.  Garokk can also manipulate matter on a sub-atomic scale; he could rearrange the very fabric of the Savage Land. He has a limited telepathic ability which allows him to learn of the activities of his worshippers through his dreams and his mental connection to his followers.

Garokk is immortal; he does not age and even when his body is destroyed, he can be returned to life. Immersion in the pool which gave him his powers will cause Garokk to revert to human form. He can be magically forced by [[Zaladane]] to respond to her summons or else suffer intense pain.

==Other versions==
===2099: World of Tomorrow===
{{Main|2099: World of Tomorrow}}
Garokk appears beneath the Savage Land during the ''2099: World of Tomorrow'' series, which ended the Earth-928 imprint of [[Marvel 2099]]. Mlle. Strange, the new Sorceress Supreme, battles Garokk, who transfers his petrified form into her body, returning to flesh and blood and claiming the title of Sorcerer Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;''2099:World of Tomorrow'' #2-6&lt;/ref&gt; The series was cancelled and the plotline was not resolved.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:X-Men ep-37.jpg|150px|thumb|Garokk in ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Garokk appeared in the two-part ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode &quot;Savage Land, Strange Heart&quot;. He was once a threat to the Savage Land until he was defeated by the [[High Evolutionary]] and imprisoned in the Earth. He worked with [[Zaladane]] in an effort to be free again, manipulating [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] into hypnotizing [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] so that her powers were unleashed at full force, re-empowering Garokk. Garokk absorbed volcanic energy turning him into an unstoppable force. However Sauron tried to absorb Garokk's energy causing an explosion that transforms Sauron back into Karl Lykos and put Garokk in his stone prison once more.

===Video games===
* Garokk appears in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]. The X-Men find him looking for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] in the Savage Land. With the help of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], the X-Men defeated him. He is later seen in a stasis cell in Avalon where he states that [[Mikhail Rasputin]] hired him to hunt Destiny in exchange for becoming ruler of the Savage Land.

'''Gary Critchley''' (born 13 August 1962) is a British man who was convicted of murder in 1981.  He has continuously maintained his innocence.

==Early life and background==
Critchley grew-up in [[Northfield, Birmingham]].  As a teenager he became involved in left-wing politics and the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement.  In 1977 Critchley was excluded from school for leading 'pupil power' demonstrations.  He finished his secondary education in a [[borstal]] after being convicted of theft and criminal damage.  On his release Critchley developed a serious [[substance abuse|drug problem]], drifting further into crime. In 1980 he moved to [[London]].&lt;ref name=JFGC&gt;{{cite web |author=Alistair|title=Brief biography of Gary Critchley|url=http://www.justiceforgarycritchley.org/?p=62|work= |publisher=Justice For Gary Critchley|date=6 May 2010|accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and murder conviction==
In June 1980 Critchley was found lying unconscious outside a London [[Squatting|squat]]. He had suffered head injuries, a broken back, ankle and wrist.  Critchley was wearing a boot on one foot and an undone [[Athletic shoe|trainer]], two sizes too small, on the other.  Police searched the squat and found the body of Edward McNeill who had been brutally beaten to death. A bloody imprint at the murder scene matched the trainer on Critchley's foot and he was arrested.

Critchley was charged with murder and subsequently convicted. He was ordered to be detained [[at Her Majesty's Pleasure]], the juvenile equivalent of a [[life sentence]]. The judge recommended that he should receive a maximum tariff of nine years.&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Cowan|title=The Birmingham prisoner who has spent 30 years inside protesting his innocence
|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2010/09/25/the-birmingham-prisoner-who-has-spent-30-years-inside-protesting-his-innocence-97319-27338804/|work= |publisher=Birmingham Mail|date=25 September 2010|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
Critchley's family persistently campaigned for his release arguing that his original conviction was [[Unsafe conviction|unsafe]]. They maintain that the only forensic evidence to link him to the heavily blood splattered murder scene was on the ill-fitting trainer and that witness statements naming somebody else as the killer were never put before the court.

Critchley's campaigners received the support of [[Richard Burden|Richard Burden MP]] who tabled questions in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] regarding this matter.&lt;ref name=Cowan/&gt;

==Release, reimprisonment and later events==
Critchley was twice released from prison on licence but was returned there on both occasions after breaching its conditions.&lt;ref name=Cowan/&gt;  He was once again released in March 2012 and currently remains free.&lt;ref name=Aspinal&gt;{{cite web |author=Adam Aspinal|title=Gary Critchley enjoys his first day of freedom after being in jail for 30 years |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/gary-critchley-enjoys-his-first-day-230310|work= |publisher=[[Birmingham Mail]]|date=4 March 2012|accessdate=}}

'''Gary Charles Evans''' (October 7, 1954 – August 14, 1998) was a confessed [[serial killer]] in and around the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]] of [[Upstate New York]].  His penchant for stealing antiques and his multiple escapes from custody &amp;mdash; including one that ended in his death &amp;mdash; made him headline news in the area on numerous occasions.

== Early life ==

Evans was born in [[Troy, New York]] to Roy Evans and Flora Mae Lee. As a child, he suffered beatings at the hands of both parents, and claimed that he was raped by his father when he was eight. Flora Mae Evans was a [[mentally ill]] woman who attempted suicide on numerous occasions, once misfiring a weapon and accidentally shooting her husband in the shoulder. His parents divorced in 1968, and his mother remarried and divorced four times before [[coming out]] as a [[lesbian]] when Gary was seventeen.&lt;ref&gt;http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Evans,%20Gary%20-%20fall,%202005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

== 1990s ==

In October 1991, Evans spent two weeks on the roof of a building in [[Little Falls (city), New York|Little Falls, New York]] casing a coin and jewelry shop on the first floor which was owned by Gregory Jouben, 36.  On October 17, 1991, Evans walked into Jouben's shop, asked him to price a piece of merchandise, and then shot him to death.  The small community in sparsely populated [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] was outraged by one of the few murders of the year in the area.

In 1993, Evans stole over 800 antiques from a group shop in [[Quechee, Vermont]]. Evans used an engine crane to steal a thousand-pound bench out of an [[Albany, New York|Albany]] cemetery, but he was arrested when his [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] became nervous and turned him in.  In early 1994, Evans agreed to assist the authorities by obtaining information on Jeffrey Williams, who was implicated in the high-profile murder of Karolyn Lonczak.  When Williams was found guilty, Evans was released on February 12, 1994, with police still unaware that Evans himself had killed at least four people at that point.&lt;ref name=&quot;mlorg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=[untitled page]| work =Marijuana Library.org | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.marijuanalibrary.org/981206.html | accessdate =}} quoting and republishing: {{cite news | last =Fitzpatrick | first =Edward | title = Snitches come with a price | newspaper = Times Union | location = Albany, NY | pages = | publisher = | date = 1998-12-06 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gary Gauger''' is a formerly imprisoned convict, who was falsely accused and convicted of the [[murder]]s of his parents, Morris and Ruth Gauger, and later [[exonerated]]. Following the murder on April 8, 1993, Gauger ultimately spent nearly two years in prison and 9 months on [[Death Row]] before being released in March 1996.

==Murder and trial==
On April 9, 1993, Gary Gauger called the U.S. emergency number [[9-1-1]] after finding his 74-year-old father's body. Paramedics were summoned, as well as the [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry County]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriff's Department]], who soon found the body of 70-year-old Ruth Gauger in a trailer on the property.{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejusticeproject.org/profiles/gary-gauger/print/ &quot;Gary Gauger&quot;]. The Justice Project. Web. 09 Nov. 2010.{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauger told officers he was asleep when his parents were murdered. Despite this, Gauger was interrogated for 21 hours by the police. Officers lied to Gauger and told him that they had found evidence against him. &quot;They told me that they had found bloody clothes in my bedroom; they found a bloody knife in my pocket,&quot; he said. After showing Gauger gruesome photographs of his parents, Gauger broke down and confessed. Though Gauger had no memory of the crime, he believed what police had told him. &quot;I thought I must have done it in a blackout,&quot; he said. Though he had given a confession, there was no physical evidence held against him in court. Gauger was found guilty of the double murder, and was sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=123938&amp;page=1 &quot;Why Innocent People Confess to Murder&quot;]. [[ABC News]]. 09 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exoneration==
On March 8, 1996, the Second District Illinois Appellate Court unanimously reversed and remanded the case for a new trial on the ground that Cowlin erred in failing to grant a motion to suppress Gary’s allegedly inculpatory statements. In an unpublished opinion written by Judge S. Louis Rathje, with Judges Robert D. McLaren and Fred A. Geiger concurring, the court held that the statements were the fruit of an arrest made without probable cause and therefore should not have been admitted at the trial.

Without the confession, McHenry County State’s Attorney Gary W. Pack had no choice but to drop the charges, and set Gary free. Pack continued to suggest publicly that Gary had in fact committed the crime and was freed only because the prosecution could not meet its burden of proof without the confession. He was pardoned in 2002 after two motorcycle gang members were ultimately convicted of the crime. Despite this, Pack continues to profess that Gary had committed the crime. Gauger was denied the right to receive compensation for his imprisonment, citing immunity to the police, detectives, and prosecutors.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Post-prison life==
Gauger gained national attention following his exoneration, and was featured on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'',{{episode needed|date=March 2014}}  ''[[60 Minutes]]'',{{episode needed|date=March 2014}}  ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'',{{episode needed|date=March 2014}}  ''[[Connie Chung Tonight]]'',{{episode needed|date=March 2014}}  ''[[A&amp;E Investigative Reports]]'',{{episode needed|date=March 2014}}  and ''[[Court TV]]''.{{episode needed|date=March 2014}}

Gauger is one of six people whose stories were dramatized in the acclaimed play ''[[The Exonerated (play)|The Exonerated]]''. The play, written by Eric Jensen and Jessica Blank, details how each individual was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, in addition to their exoneration after varying years of imprisonment. ''[[The Exonerated]]'' is a film adaptation, which first aired on the CourtTV cable television station on January 27, 2005. Gauger is portrayed by [[Brian Dennehy]] in the film. At the end of the film it fades from the actor to Gauger himself who talks about his wife, his work and his freedom.

Gauger's story is also featured in 'Deadline' a documentary on the death row prisoners http://deadlinethemovie.com/characters/additional_characters.php 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390190/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1a

Gauger has since published a memoir of the ordeal entitled ''In Spite of the System'' with Julie Von Bergen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garygauger.com/ &quot;Gary Gauger&quot;]. garygauger.com. Nov 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gary Mark Gilmore''' (December 4, 1940 – January 17, 1977) was an American criminal who gained international notoriety for demanding the implementation of his [[death penalty|death sentence]] for two murders he committed in [[Utah]]. After the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld a new series of death penalty statutes in the 1976 decision ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'', he became the first person in almost ten years to be executed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Graham|title=License to Kill|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1979/jun/28/license-to-kill/?pagination=false|accessdate=29 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=28 June 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new statutes avoided the problems under the 1972 decision in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]],'' which had resulted in earlier death penalty statutes being deemed as &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; punishment, and therefore unconstitutional. (The Supreme Court had previously ordered all states to commute death sentences to life imprisonment after Furman v. Georgia.) Gilmore was [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death Watch in Salt Lake City|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945718,00.html#paid-wall|accessdate=1 May 2013|newspaper=Time|date=24 Jan 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gary Mark Gilmore was born in [[McCamey, Texas]], on December 4, 1940, the second of four sons, to Frank and Bessie Gilmore. The other sons were Frank, Jr., Gaylen, and the writer and music journalist  [[Mikal Gilmore]]. Frank Gilmore Sr. (1890&amp;ndash;1962), an [[alcoholic]] con man, had other wives and families, none of whom he supported.{{fact|date=February 2016}} On a whim he married Bessie (née Brown) (1914 &amp;ndash; June 1980), a [[Mormon]] outcast from [[Provo, Utah]], in [[Sacramento, California]]. Gary was born while they were living in Texas under the pseudonym of Coffman to avoid the law. Frank christened his son Faye Robert Coffman, but once they left Texas, Bessie changed it to Gary Mark. This name change proved to be a sore point years later. Frank's mother Fay kept the original &quot;Faye Coffman&quot; birth certificate, and when Gary found it two decades later, he assumed he must be either illegitimate or someone else's son. He seized on this as the reason that he and his father never got along; he became very upset and walked out on his mother when she tried to explain the name change to him.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, Mikal; pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of illegitimacy, real or imagined, was common in the Gilmore family. Frank, Sr.'s mother Fay Gilmore once told Bessie that Frank, Sr.'s father was a famous magician who had passed through Sacramento, where she was living. Bessie researched this at the library and concluded that Frank was the illegitimate son of [[Harry Houdini]]. In fact Houdini was only sixteen years old in 1890, the year of Frank Gilmore's birth, and did not begin his career as a magician until the following year. [[Mikal Gilmore]], Gary's youngest brother, believes the story to be false, but has stated that both his father and mother believed it.

During Gary's childhood, the family frequently relocated throughout the [[Western United States]], with Frank supporting them by selling fake magazine subscriptions. Gary had a troubled relationship with his father, whom his youngest brother Mikal described as a &quot;cruel and unreasonable man.&quot; Frank Gilmore, Sr. was strict and quick to anger, and would often whip his sons Frank, Jr., Gary and Gaylen with a [[razor strop]], whip or a belt for little or no reason. Less often, he would beat his wife. He mellowed somewhat with age: Mikal reported that Frank whipped him only once, and never did it again after Mikal told him, &quot;I hate you.&quot; In addition, Frank and Bessie would argue loudly and verbally abuse each other. Frank would anger Bessie by calling her crazy, and defame [[Brigham Young]], the second president and prophet of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], as &quot;Bring 'em Young.&quot; Bessie would retaliate by calling him a &quot;Cat-licker&quot; [Catholic] and threatening to kill him some night. This abuse continued for years, and caused considerable turmoil within the Gilmore family.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, Mikal;  pp. 123–127, 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Gilmore family settled in [[Portland, Oregon]]. As an adolescent, Gary began engaging in [[petty crime]]. Although Gilmore had an [[IQ]] test score of 133, gained high scores on both aptitude and achievement tests, and showed artistic talent, he dropped out of [[high school]] in the ninth grade. He ran away from home with a friend to Texas, returning to Portland after several months. At the age of 14, he started a small car theft ring with friends, which resulted in his first arrest. He was released to his father with a warning. Two weeks later he was back in court on another car theft charge. The court remanded him to the [[MacLaren Youth Correctional Facility|MacLaren Reform School for Boys]] in Oregon, from which he was released the following year. He was sent to [[Oregon State Correctional Institution]] on another car theft charge in 1960, and was released later that year. In 1961, Frank, Sr., was diagnosed with terminal [[lung cancer]]; he died at the end of June 1962, while Gary was still in prison. One of his jailers told Gary when his father died. Despite his dysfunctional relationship with his father, Gary was devastated and tried to kill himself by slitting his wrists.

==Criminal career==
In 1962, Gilmore was arrested again and sent to the [[Oregon State Penitentiary]] for [[armed robbery]] and [[assault]]. He faced assault and armed robbery charges again in 1964, and was given a 15-year prison sentence as a [[habitual offender]]. A prison psychiatrist diagnosed him with [[antisocial personality disorder]] with intermittent [[psychotic]] decompensation. He was granted conditional release in 1972 to live weekdays in a [[halfway house]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], and study art at a [[community college]]. Gilmore never registered and, within a month, he was arrested and convicted of [[armed robbery]].

Because of his violent behavior in prison, Gilmore was transferred in 1975 from Oregon to the maximum security [[United States Penitentiary, Marion|federal prison in Marion, Illinois]].

Gilmore was conditionally paroled in April 1976 and went to [[Provo, Utah]], to live with a distant cousin, Brenda Nicol, who tried to help him find work. Gilmore worked briefly at his uncle Vern Damico's shoe repair store and then for an insulation company, but he soon returned to his previous lifestyle of stealing, drinking, and getting into fights. Gilmore, then 35, had a relationship with Nicole Baker, a 19-year-old widow and divorcee who had two young children. The relationship was at first casual, but soon became intense and strained due to Gilmore's aggressive behavior and pressure from Baker's family to stop her seeing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Murders===
On the evening of July 19, 1976, Gilmore robbed and murdered Max Jensen, a gas station employee in [[Orem, Utah]]. The next evening, he robbed and murdered Bennie Bushnell, a motel manager in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]]. Although both men had complied with his demands, he murdered each of them. While disposing of the .22 caliber pistol used in both killings, Gilmore accidentally shot himself in his right hand, leaving a trail of blood to the service garage, where he had left his truck to be repaired prior to murdering Bushnell. Garage mechanic Michael Simpson witnessed Gilmore hiding the gun in the bushes. Seeing the blood on Gilmore's crudely bandaged right hand when he approached to pay for the repairs to his truck, and hearing on a [[police scanner]] of the shooting at the nearby motel, Simpson wrote down Gilmore's license number and called the police. Gilmore's cousin, Brenda, turned him in to police shortly after he phoned her asking for bandages and painkillers for the injury to his hand. The Utah State Police apprehended Gilmore as he tried to drive out of Provo, and he gave up without attempting to flee. Although he was charged with the murders of Jensen and Bushnell, the first case was never brought to trial, apparently because there were no eyewitnesses.

==Trial==
Gilmore's murder trial began at the Provo courthouse on October 5, 1976 and lasted two days. Peter Arroyo, a motel guest, testified that he saw Gilmore in the motel registration office that night. After taking the money, Gilmore allegedly ordered Bushnell to lie down on the floor and then shot him. Gerald F. Wilkes, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[ballistics]] expert, matched the two shell casings and the bullet that killed Bushnell to the gun hidden in the bush, and a patrolman testified that he had traced Gilmore's trail of blood to that same bush. Gilmore's two court-appointed lawyers, [[Michael D. Esplin|Michael Esplin]] and Craig Snyder, made no attempt to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] the majority of the state's witnesses, and rested without calling any witnesses for the defense. Gilmore protested, and the following day asked the judge if he could take the stand in his own defense, perhaps arguing that due to the [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] and lack of control he felt at the time, he had a good case for insanity. His attorneys presented the findings of four separate psychiatrists, all of whom had said that Gilmore was aware of what he was doing and that he knew it was wrong at the time. While he did have an antisocial personality disorder, which may have been aggravated by drinking and drugs, he did not meet the legal criteria for insanity. Gilmore withdrew his request. On October 7, the [[jury]] retired to deliberate and by mid-day, they had returned with a guilty verdict. Later that day, the jury unanimously recommended the death penalty due to the special circumstances of the crime.

Gary chose to not pursue [[habeas corpus]] relief in federal court. His mother, Bessie, sued for a stay of execution on his behalf. In a five-to-four decision, the US Supreme Court refused to hear his mother's claim. The Court's ''per curiam'' opinion said that the defendant had waived his rights by not pursuing them. At the time, Utah had two methods of execution — [[firing squad]] or [[hanging]]. Believing a hanging could be botched, Gilmore chose the former, declaring, &quot;I'd prefer to be shot.&quot; The execution was set for November 15 at 8 AM.

Against his express wishes, Gilmore received several stays of execution through the efforts of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU). The last of these occurred just hours before the re-scheduled execution date of January 17. That stay was overturned at 7:30 AM, and the execution was allowed to proceed as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An American Punishment Again|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0C17FC3F5D167493CAA8178AD85F438785F9|accessdate=1 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 Jan 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a Board of Pardons hearing in November 1976, Gilmore said of the efforts by the ACLU and others to prevent his execution: &quot;They always want to get in on the act. I don't think they have ever really done anything effective in their lives. I would like them all — including that group of [[reverend]]s and [[rabbi]]s from [[Salt Lake City]] — to butt out. This is my life and this is my death. It's been sanctioned by the courts that I die and I accept that.&quot;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

During the time Gilmore was on [[death row]] awaiting his execution, he attempted [[suicide]] twice; the first time on November 16 after the first stay was issued, and again one month later on December 16.

==Execution==
[[File:Utah State Prison Wasatch Facility.jpg|thumb|Gilmore was executed by firing squad at [[Utah State Prison]].]]
Gilmore was executed on January 17, 1977, at 8:07&amp;nbsp;a.m. by [[firing squad]] at [[Utah State Prison]] in [[Draper, Utah]]. The night before, Gilmore had requested an all-night gathering of friends and family at the prison mess hall. On the evening before his execution, he was served a [[last meal]] of steak, potatoes, milk and coffee but consumed only the milk and coffee. His uncle, Vern Damico, who attended the gathering, later claimed to have smuggled in three small, 50ml [[Jack Daniel's]] whiskey bottles which Gilmore supposedly consumed.

In the morning at the time of execution, Gilmore was transported to an abandoned [[cannery]] behind the prison, which served as its death house. He was strapped to a chair, with a wall of sandbags placed behind him to trap the [[bullet]]s. Five gunmen, local police officers, stood concealed behind a curtain with five small holes, through which they aimed their rifles.

The five executioners were equipped with [[.30-30]]-caliber rifles and off-the-shelf [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] 150-grain (9.7&amp;nbsp;g) SilverTip ammunition. The condemned was restrained and hooded, and the shots were fired at a distance of 20 feet (6&amp;nbsp;m), aiming at the chest.

Prison officials stated that the firing squad comprised four men with blanks, and one with a live round, so that the shooters could not be certain as to who fired the fatal shots.&lt;ref name=AP19770118&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=January 18, 1977 |title=Gilmore died two minutes after four bullets hit him |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7767494// |newspaper=The San Bernardino County Sun |location=San Bernardino, CA |publisher= |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=January 9, 2017 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon inspecting the clothes worn by his brother Gary at his execution, Mikal Gilmore noted five holes in the shirt.

Gilmore had requested that some of his organs be donated for transplant purposes.&lt;ref name=AP19770118/&gt; Within hours of the execution, two people received his [[cornea]]s.

As Gilmore was the first person in the United States executed since the [[Gregg v. Georgia|reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976]], his story had immense cultural resonance at the time. It continues to influence the works of writers, artists and advertisers in the early 21st century.

Before his execution, the December 11, 1976, episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (Season 2, Episode 10) featured guest host [[Candice Bergen]] and the cast singing a Christmas-themed [[medley (music)|medley]] entitled &quot;Let's Kill Gary Gilmore For Christmas.&quot; Dressed in winter attire and surrounded by fake snow, the performers sang the medley of familiar Christmas carols with altered lyrics. Lyrics set to &quot;[[Winter Wonderland]]&quot; included this line: &quot;In the meadow we can build a snowman / One with Gary Gilmore packed inside / We'll ask him, 'Are you dead yet?' He'll say, 'No, man' / But we'll wait out the frostbite till he dies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://snltranscripts.jt.org/76/76jgilmore.phtml Saturday Night Live Transcripts — Season 2: Episode 10 — Candice Bergen / Frank Zappa]}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Later in the TV season and subsequent to Gilmore's death, NBC re-ran the episode, but the network removed this musical sequence. In its place, NBC inserted a brief, Christmas-oriented film — filmed at an airport about people meeting friends and relatives after disembarking from airplanes. For a subsequent broadcast of this episode in 2005, NBC reinserted the original Gilmore sequence.&lt;/ref&gt; A later episode of ''Saturday Night Live,'' on October 20, 1979, featured guest host [[Eric Idle]] performing impersonations while strapped to a stretcher, assisted by orderlies. With the stretcher standing on end, Idle covered his eyes with a black blindfold and announced it as an impersonation of Gary Gilmore.

Television comedies have referred to the Gilmore execution, specifically his final words, &quot;Let's do this.&quot; The ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode, &quot;[[The Jacket (Seinfeld)|The Jacket]],&quot; originally included a reference to Gary Gilmore's final words, but the scene was changed during the final shoot. In the deleted scene, [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] is trying to decide upon buying the titular jacket, when he remarks to [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]]: &quot;Well, in the immortal words of Gary Gilmore 'Let's do this.'&quot; On the ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' episode, &quot;The Wedding,&quot; [[Roseanne Barr|Roseanne]]'s daughter Darlene is asked if she is ready to get married. Darlene responds with a similar [[Punch line|punchline]], &quot;Well in the words of Gary Gilmore, 'Let's do it.'&quot;  On ''[[NYPD Blue]],'' [[Andy Sipowicz]] cracks &quot;Let's do this,&quot; as his wedding is about to begin, then explains further, &quot;That's what that guy in Utah said...'Let's do this.' He said that to the firing squad just before they whacked him.&quot;

The founder of advertising agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]], [[Dan Wieden]] credits the inspiration for his &quot;[[Just Do It]]&quot; [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] slogan to Gilmore's last words.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/media/20adco.html?_r=3&amp;ref=business |author= Peters, Jeremy W. |title= The Birth of 'Just Do It' and Other Magic Words |date= August 19, 2009 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= 2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Mailer]] wrote a novel, ''[[The Executioner's Song]],'' based on Gilmore's life; it won the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Notable for its portrayal of Gilmore and the anguish surrounding the murders he committed, the book expressed Mailer's thinking about the national debate over the revival of capital punishment. Another writer to blend fact with fiction was Colombian writer [[Rafael Chaparro Madiedo]], who featured Gilmore as one of the main characters of his 1992 novel ''Opio en las Nubes,'' which won the National Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opioenlasnubes-pinktomate.blogspot.com/2008/11/capitulo-4-los-ojos-de-gary-gilmour.html|title=OPIO EN LAS NUBES - RAFAEL CHAPARRO MADIEDO|author=PINK TOMATE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, ''[[The Executioner's Song (film)|The Executioner's Song]]'' was adapted by Mailer for a television movie of the same name starring [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Gilmore, and co-starring [[Christine Lahti]], [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Rosanna Arquette]]. Jones won an [[Emmy Award]] for his portrayal of Gilmore. Gilmore's brother's memoir ''[[Shot in the Heart]]'' was adapted as an [[Home Box Office|HBO]] movie. Artist [[Matthew Barney]]'s film ''Cremaster 2'' (1999), featured Gilmore as the main character; it was the second of five films in the series ''[[The Cremaster Cycle]].'' Played by an actress, the metamorphosed character corresponding to Gilmore appears in the beginning of ''Cremaster 3''.

[[Jack Nicholson]]'s performance in ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' was reportedly inspired in part by Gilmore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert, Roger&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810521/FILMFESTIVALS01/100529988|title=Cannes, 1981: A study in the art of being rude|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=1981-05-21|accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welsh people|Welsh]] playwright [[Dic Edwards]] dramatised Gilmore's life in his 1995 play ''Utah Blue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/plays/review_archive.asp?playname=Utah%20Blue&amp;company=Made%20in%20Wales |title='Utah Blue' by Dic Edwards |author= |authorlink= |date=2006 |publisher=Theatre in Wales |work= |accessdate=December 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[The Judy's]] released the song &quot;How's Gary?&quot; on their album ''Wonderful World of Appliances''. The song presumably asks Gary Gilmore's mother what's wrong with him, saying that he never comes out to play anymore. The song also inquires about the holes in his vest and why he is wearing a blindfold.

Several playwrights have integrated the Gilmore story into their work in one way or another. The [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]-based performance artist [[Monte Cazazza]] sent out photos of himself in an [[electric chair]] on the day of the execution. One of these was mistakenly printed in a Hong Kong newspaper as the real execution. Cazazza was also photographed alongside [[COUM Transmissions]]/[[Throbbing Gristle]] members [[Genesis P-Orridge]] and [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]] for the &quot;Gary Gilmore Memorial Society&quot; postcard, in which the three artists posed blindfolded and tied to chairs with loaded guns pointed at them to depict Gilmore's execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Gary Lee Davis''' (August 13, 1944 &amp;ndash; October 13, 1997) was a convicted [[murder]]er and [[rape|rapist]] who was executed by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Colorado]] in 1997. He is the only person to date to have been subject to the [[Capital punishment in Colorado|death penalty in Colorado]] since its reinstatement in 1975.

==Early life==
Davis was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Although raised by his mother, he later claimed to have suffered [[sexual abuse]] from an early age at the hands of his older stepbrothers. After dropping out of school in the ninth grade, Davis joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1961; he married Tonya Ann Tatem and had two sons with her before their divorce. Davis held various jobs before marrying Leona Coates in 1974; he was 30 and she was 17 years old. They had four children.

Although Davis apparently had a history of predatory sexual behavior, which he later admitted to in various accounts following his conviction for murder (on one occasion, he estimated that he had raped 15 women), his criminal record included only convictions for [[grand larceny]] and burglary in [[Kansas]] in 1970 and 1971, and menacing in [[Colorado]] in 1979. In 1982, Davis was jailed on a [[sexual assault]] conviction in Colorado; during his imprisonment, he struck up a correspondence with Rebecca Fincham. The two married in 1984, while Davis was still in prison. He was released in 1985 and he and Fincham moved to [[Byers, Colorado]].

==Murder, trial, and conviction==
On July 21, 1986, Davis and Fincham kidnapped their neighbor, Virginia May, from in front of her children; they subsequently drove her to a deserted field, where Davis raped May and then shot her 14 times with a rifle. At trial, Davis confessed to the murder, despite the advice of his attorneys; he was sentenced to death exactly one year after the murder, on July 21, 1987. The jury took three hours to reach a verdict. 

Davis alternately encouraged and suspended appeals of his death sentence, which was upheld by state courts in 1990 and federal courts in 1995. During the time he sat on Colorado's death row, Davis was able to reunite with some of his family, including his first two wives, and, according to some witnesses, experienced a dramatic spiritual conversion during his final years.

Then-Governor of Colorado [[Roy Romer]] refused to grant [[clemency]] to Davis, stating, in part: &quot;[T]here undoubtedly has been some rehabilitation of his character and his demeanor. But I do not believe that whatever remorse or rehabilitation that is displayed here justifies reaching that extraordinary event that would cause this governor to give him clemency.&quot;

==Execution==
Davis's last meal before his execution was [[ice cream]]. Shortly before his execution, Davis also requested a [[cigarette]]; as a [[smoking ban]] was in place in Colorado prisons, his request was denied. He made no final statement before being executed by [[lethal injection]]. 

Davis was pronounced dead at the [[Colorado]] State [[Prison|Penitentiary]] at 8:33 p.m. on October 13, 1997. As his death was the first execution carried out by the state of Colorado in approximately three decades, the event was subject to intense media coverage; about 200 anti-death-penalty protesters gathered outside the prison as Davis was executed, as did a smaller group of death penalty supporters. {{As of|2015|7}}, Davis remains the only prisoner executed in the state of Colorado since 1967; his execution was the 417th carried out in the United States since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.

'''Gary L. Sampson''' (born September 29, 1959) is an American murderer who killed three people and was sentenced to death by a federal jury in [[Massachusetts]], United States.

During three days in 2001, Sampson killed three strangers: retiree Philip McCloskey in [[Marshfield, Massachusetts]], college student Jonathan Rizzo in [[Abington, Massachusetts]], and Robert Whitney in [[Meredith, New Hampshire]]. He also attempted to kill a fourth victim and stranger: William Gregory, in [[Vermont]]. Sampson killed McCloskey and Rizzo after they picked him up hitch-hiking, stabbing them to death.  Shortly after that he strangled Whitney.  Sampson pleaded guilty to the three killings on September 9, 2003, and was sentenced to death on December 23, 2003, by a federal jury in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =| title =TIMELINE: Gary Sampson's life of crime and punishment| quote =| newspaper =[[The Patriot Ledger]]| date = August 30, 2010| url =http://www.patriotledger.com/article/20100830/NEWS/308309827?template=printart| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =| title =Death for Sampson| quote =| newspaper =The Boston Globe| date = December 24, 2003| url =http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/12/24/death_for_sampson/| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He received the death penalty for the two Massachusetts killings, and a life sentence for the New Hampshire case.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =| title =Feds cite prison misconduct in carjack death penalty case| quote =| newspaper =[[WCVB-TV|WCVB]]| date = March 31, 2014| url =http://www.wcvb.com/news/feds-cite-prison-misconduct-in-carjack-death-penalty-case/25257488| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sampson pleaded guilty, a federal jury decided whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison. The defense introduced mental health experts to testify that Sampson had [[dyslexia]] as a child, had [[bipolar disorder]], and &quot;suffered from a significant mental impairment&quot; during the killings.  A psychiatrist called by the government testified that Sampson did not suffer from any mitigating mental impairment; he was intelligent but violent and deeply antisocial, with [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelley Murphy&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author = Shelley Murphy| title =Sampson jury hears pleas for life, death | newspaper =[[The Boston Globe]] | date =  December 19, 2003| url =http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/12/19/sampson_jury_hears_pleas_for_life_death/| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton J.

==Early and personal life==
Gary Sampson, who was born in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], and raised in [[Abington, Massachusetts]], was diagnosed with [[dyslexia]] as a child but was denied [[special education]] because of his intelligence. He dropped out of school in the 9th grade. His parents are Charlotte and Elbert &quot;Herc&quot; Sampson. His father worked as a [[firefighter]], ice cream truck driver, and salesman. Sampson has claimed that his father called him &quot;retarded&quot; and physically abused him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelley Murphy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;business.highbeam.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author =| title =Killer's parents severed all ties to son| quote =| newspaper =[[The Boston Herald]]| date = December 3, 2003| url =http://business.highbeam.com/3972/article-1G1-110848969/killer-parents-severed-all-ties-son| accessdate =May 19, 2015}} {{subscription needed|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Sue Reinert| title =Sampson record spanned four states| quote = He was born at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth on Sept. 29, 1959.| newspaper =[[The Patriot Ledger]]| date = August 2, 2001| url =http://www.patriotledger.com/article/20010802/News/308029998| accessdate =May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampson's defense lawyers claim that at age four, he fell and hit his head, resulting in a [[brain injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =| title =Gary Lee Sampson's lawyers appear in court ahead of resentencing trial| quote =| newspaper =[[WFXT|My FOX Boston]]| date = April 15, 2015| url =http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/28808598/convicted-killer-gary-lee-sampson-due-in-court| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =Fox Butterfield| title =Police Arrest Man in Killings And Carjackings in 3 States| quote =| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| date = August 2, 2001| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/02/us/police-arrest-man-in-killings-and-carjackings-in-3-states.html| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sampson had been frequently arrested as a juvenile, and as an adult was caught on surveillance tape robbing five banks in North Carolina while in disguise. Gerald Hege, sheriff of [[Davidson County, North Carolina]], stated that Sampson had lived with [[cross-dresser]]s and [[transvestite]]s, and had learned &quot;elaborate makeup&quot; from them. &quot;He learned how to change his appearance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =Fox Butterfield| title =Police Arrest Man in Killings and Carjackings in 3 States| quote =&quot;'He had the unusual M.O. of robbing the banks dressed as a woman, with elaborate makeup he had learned from the transvestites,' the sheriff said.&quot;| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| date = August 2, 2001| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/02/us/police-arrest-man-in-killings-and-carjackings-in-3-states.html| accessdate =November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =Harry R.

As of 2003, Sampson had been married and divorced five times, and is the father of three children. His first marriage was when he was 17 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;business.highbeam.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = J.M.

In June 1997, Sampson and Alexander were married; she was pregnant by Sampson at the time. Shortly after, he moved to [[South Carolina]] with a woman he had recently met, and Alexander filed for divorce that same year. Sampson was arrested in May 1998, and met Amanda Newcomb while jailed. When Newcomb's grandfather posted Sampson's bail, Sampson and Newcomb married in October 1998. By the end of November, Sampson had moved to North Carolina, where he had a relationship with Ricky Carter, &quot;a transvestite who recalled him as angry with the world and having an explosive temper.&quot; When Carter kicked him out of their apartment, Sampson met and wooed Karen Anderson in April 2001. Sampson attempted to force Anderson to assist him in his robberies; she refused, and Sampson began his bank robbery spree, robbing five banks in three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = J.M.

==Crimes and death penalty trial==
{{citation needed span|text=In July 2001 Sampson [[carjack]]ed and murdered three people: Philip McCloskey (aged 69 of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]), Jonathan Rizzo (aged 19 of [[Kingston, Massachusetts]]), and Robert Whitney (aged 58 of [[Concord, New Hampshire]]). The murders took place over the course of a week. Sampson told police that, after McCloskey picked him up [[hitchhiking]], he forced him at knifepoint to drive to a secluded area, where he tied him up with his belt and stabbed him 24 times. He also forced Rizzo to a secluded area, tied him to a tree, gagged him, and killed him.|date=May 2015}}

The day before the first murder, he attempted to surrender to police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton J. Valencia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boston.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Elizabeth Mehren| title =Death Debated for a Confessed Killer| quote =The controversy in the case is complicated by the fact that Sampson telephoned the Boston office of the FBI and offered to surrender before killing his three victims. William H. Anderson, the clerk who took the call, originally told investigators that he had not received a call from Sampson. In March, Wolf sentenced Anderson to six months in federal prison for lying to the investigators after phone records proved Sampson had indeed placed the call.| newspaper =[[Los Angeles Times]]| date =November 6, 2003| url =http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/06/nation/na-death6| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telephone records confirmed that Sampson had called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). As a fugitive who was facing bank robbery charges in North Carolina, Sampson could have been taken into custody. The call was accidentally disconnected by an FBI clerk, and no action was taken. After the murders, Sampson surrendered in Vermont and confessed. He subsequently pleaded guilty.

Sampson was charged in a federal court in [[Boston]], found guilty and, on December 23, 2003, sentenced to death. The jury deliberated for ten hours after hearing six weeks of evidence. Sampson had pleaded guilty, so the jury did not need to decide whether he killed McCloskey and Rizzo, but the jury heard the murders described in graphic detail during the sentencing phase of the trial. Prosecutors portrayed Sampson as a ruthless, calculating killer who preyed on [[good samaritan]]s. {{citation needed span|text= Massachusetts does not have the death penalty, after having abolished capital punishment in 1984.|date=May 2015}} The last time the Commonwealth used the penalty was in 1974.

===Place of planned execution===
Although the United States has a federal &quot;death row&quot; at the [[United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute]], in Indiana (where federal death row inmates are executed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =| title =Sentence to be appealed| quote =| newspaper =The Boston Globe| date =December 24, 2003| url =http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/12/24/sentence_to_be_appealed/| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge [[Mark L. Wolf]] of the U.S. District Court in Boston ordered that Sampson be executed in New Hampshire.  However, before the execution could take place, Judge Wolf  ordered a new sentencing trial for Sampson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper =[[FindLaw]] blog| date = May 9, 2013| url =http://blogs.findlaw.com/first_circuit/2013/05/first-circuit-may-hear-gary-sampson-death-penalty-case.html| accessdate =May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal process===
After Sampson was sentenced to death, his lawyer David Ruhnke said he would [[appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On January 26, 2004, the judge said on the record (United States v Gary Lee Sampson CR 01-10384 January 26, 2004 page 21), that he found the testimony of the defense expert, Angela Hegarty, to be more credible than that of the government's expert, [[Michael Welner]], with regards to whether the defendant suffered from [[bipolar disorder]]. {{citation needed span|text=Not one of the jurors agreed that Sampson was mentally ill.|date=May 2015}}

In 2011, the death penalty decision was vacated by the US district judge after finding that one of the jurors lied during the screening process; a federal appeals court upheld the decision.

A week before the September sentencing retrial was to begin, it was &quot;stalled while prosecutors decide whether to appeal a federal judge's refusal to step down from the case.&quot; Prosecutors were given until October 13 to decide if they would appeal the judge's decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015 retrial&quot; /&gt; On October 28, in an 89-page ruling, Judge Wolf rejected numerous defense motions, ruling that jurors will be able to consider the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Laurel J.

'''Gary Michael Heidnik''' (November 22, 1943 &amp;ndash; July 6, 1999) was an American murderer who [[kidnapping|kidnapped]], [[torture]]d, and [[rape]]d six women, and held them prisoner in his basement in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Heidnik was sentenced to [[Capital punishment|death]] and executed by [[lethal injection]] in July 1999.

==Childhood==
Heidnik was born to Michael and Ellen Heidnik, and was raised in the [[Eastlake, Ohio|Eastlake]] suburb of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. He had a younger brother, Terry. His parents divorced in 1946. The Heidnik children were then raised by their mother for four years before being placed in the care of Michael Heidnik and his new wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Englade|first=Ken |title=Cellar of Horror|year=1992|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-92929-3|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidnik would later claim that he was often [[psychologically|emotionally abused]] by his father. Heidnik suffered a lifelong problem of [[bed wetting]], and claimed his father would humiliate his son by forcing him to hang his stained sheets from his bedroom window, in full view of their neighbors. After his son's arrest, Michael Heidnik denied that he abused his son.&lt;ref name=englade19&gt;Englade 1992, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

At school, Heidnik did not interact with his fellow students, and refused to make eye contact. When a well-meaning new female student asked, &quot;Did you get the homework done, Gary?&quot;, he yelled at her and told her she was not &quot;worthy enough&quot; to talk to him. Heidnik was also teased about his oddly shaped head, which he and Terry claimed was the result of a young Heidnik's falling out of a tree. Heidnik performed well academically and tested with an [[I.Q.]] of 130.&lt;ref&gt;Englade 1992, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fiorillo&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fiorillo, Victor|title=Inside the House of Heidnik|journal=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia Magazine]]|date=2007-07-07 |url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/inside_the_house_of_heidnik/page1|accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the encouragement of his father, 14-year-old Heidnik enrolled at the since defunct [[Staunton Military Academy]] in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]] for two years, leaving before graduation. After another period in public high school, he dropped out and joined the [[United States Army]] when he was 17.&lt;ref&gt;Gruson, Lindsey.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9B0DEEDF1131F93BA15750C0A961948260 &quot;Strange Portrait of Torture Suspect.&quot;] ''[[The New York Times]]''. March 3, 1987. Retrieved on February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidnik served in the Army for 13 months. During basic training, Heidnik's drill sergeant graded him as &quot;excellent&quot;. Following basic training, he applied for several specialist positions, including the [[military police]], but was rejected. He was sent to [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], to be trained as a medic and did well through medical training. However, Heidnik did not stay in San Antonio very long and was transferred to the 46th Army Surgical Hospital in [[Landstuhl]], [[West Germany]]. Within weeks of his new posting in Germany, he earned his [[GED]].

In August 1962, Heidnik reported in sick, calling and complaining of severe headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, and nausea. A hospital neurologist diagnosed Heidnik with [[gastroenteritis]], and noted that Heidnik also displayed symptoms of mental illness, for which he was prescribed [[Trifluoperazine|trifluoperazine (Stelazine)]]. In October 1962, Heidnik was transferred to a military hospital in Philadelphia, where he was diagnosed with [[schizoid personality disorder]] and [[Military discharge|honorably discharged]] from military service.

==Adulthood==
Shortly after his discharge, Heidnik became a [[licensed practical nurse]] and enrolled at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], only to drop out after one semester. He worked as a psychiatric nurse at a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] hospital in [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania|Coatesville]], but was fired for poor attendance and rude behavior towards patients. From August 1962 until his arrest in March 1987, Heidnik spent time in and out of [[psychiatric hospital]]s, and had attempted [[suicide]] at least 13 times. In 1970, his mother Ellen, who had been diagnosed with [[bone cancer]] and was suffering the effects of [[alcoholism]], committed suicide by drinking [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercuric chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;Englade 1992, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Terry also spent time in mental institutions and attempted suicide multiple times.&lt;ref name=englade19 /&gt;

In October 1971, Heidnik incorporated a church called the United Church of the Ministers of God, initially with only five followers. In 1975, Heidnik opened an account under the church's name with [[Merrill Lynch]]. The initial deposit was $1,500. Heidnik eventually amassed over $500,000 (US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1986|r=2}}}} in 2010). By 1986, the United Church of the Ministers of God was thriving and wealthy.

Heidnik used a matrimonial service to meet his future wife, with whom he corresponded by mail for two years before proposing to her. Betty Disto arrived from the Philippines in September 1985, and married Heidnik in [[Maryland]] on October 3, 1985. The marriage rapidly deteriorated after she found Heidnik in bed with three other women. Throughout the course of their brief marriage, Heidnik forced his wife to watch while he had sex with other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael |title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|edition=2|year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=0-816-06987-5|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disto also accused him of repeatedly raping and assaulting her. With the help of the Filipino community in Philadelphia, she was able to leave Heidnik in January 1986.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963945,00.html &quot;House Of Horrors.&quot;] ''Time''. April 6, 1987. Retrieved on February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to Heidnik until his ex-wife requested child support payments in 1987, he impregnated Betty during their short marriage. On September 15, 1986, Disto gave birth to a son, whom she named Jesse John Disto.&lt;ref&gt;Englade 1992, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidnik also had a child with Gail Lincow, a son named Gary, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man who helped Heidnik is set free: Judge cautions him to be careful choosing his associates|date=July 16, 1988|work=Philadelphia Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child was placed in foster care soon after his birth. Heidnik had a third child with another woman, Anjeanette Davidson, who was illiterate and mentally disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Englade 1992, pp. 50, 185&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, Maxine Davidson, was born on March 16, 1978. The child was immediately placed in [[foster care]]. Shortly after Maxine's birth, Heidnik was arrested for the kidnapping and rape of Anjeanette's sister Alberta, who had been living in an institution for the mentally disabled in [[Penn Township, Snyder County, Pennsylvania|Penn Township]].

==Criminal activities==

===1976: First legal charges===
In 1976, Heidnik was charged with aggravated assault and carrying an unlicensed pistol after shooting the tenant of a house he offered for rent, grazing his face.

===1978: First imprisonment===
Heidnik signed his girlfriend Anjeanette Davidson's sister, Alberta, out of a mental institution on day leave, and kept her prisoner in a locked storage room in his basement in 1978. After she was found and returned to the hospital, examination revealed that she had been raped and sodomized and that she had contracted [[gonorrhea]]. Heidnik was arrested and charged with kidnapping, rape, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, and interfering with the custody of a committed person.

The original sentence was overturned on appeal, and Heidnik spent three years of his incarceration in mental institutions prior to being released in April 1983 under the supervision of a state-sanctioned mental health program.

===1986: Spousal rape===
After his wife Betty left him in 1986, Heidnik was arrested yet again and charged with assault, indecent assault, [[spousal rape]] and involuntary deviant sexual intercourse.

===1986-1987: Serial rape and murder===
On November 25, 1986, Heidnik abducted Josefina Rivera. By January 1987, he had five women held captive in the basement of his house at 3520 North Marshall Street in North Philadelphia.

The captives, who were all African-American women, were raped, beaten, and tortured.&lt;ref name=jet&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 13, 1987|title=Black Women Report of Sex, Torture, Murder At Hands of White Philadelphia 'Bishop'|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=72|issue=3|pages=9–7|issn=0021-5996|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8rMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=Cyril+%28%22Tony%22%29+Brown#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the women, Sandra Lindsay, died of a combination of starvation, torture, and an untreated fever. Heidnik dismembered her body but had a problem dealing with the arms and legs, so he put them in a freezer and marked them &quot;dog food&quot;. He cooked her ribs in an oven and boiled her head in a pot on the stove. Police came to the house due to the complaints of a bad odor, but left the premises after Heidnik's explanation: &quot;I’m cooking a roast. I fell asleep and it burnt.&quot;&lt;ref name=Fiorillo/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tvguide.com&quot;&gt;{{cite video|quote = ''Escaped'' episode, &quot;Cellar of Terror&quot;, first aired on [[Investigation Discovery]] on April 13, 2009|url=http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=297145&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=10918459|website=TVguide.com|title=Episode Detail: 'Cellar of Terror&quot; - ''Escaped''

Several sources state that he ground up the flesh of Lindsay, mixed it with dog food, and fed that to his other victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963945,00.html|title=House Of Horrors: Serial Murder in Philadelphia|date=6 April 1987|work=TIME.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/H/HEIDNIK_gary.php|title=serial killer true crime library * serial killer news * list of serial killers * serial murder * female serial killers * crime scene investigation * tueur en serie * omicidi seriali *|work=crimezzz.net|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His defense attorney, Chuck Peruto, said that upon examination of a Cuisinart and other tools in his kitchen, they found no evidence of this. Peruto said that he made up the story to support the insanity defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;phillymag.com&quot;&gt;http://www.phillymag.com/articles/inside-the-house-of-heidnik/&lt;/ref&gt; The defense attorney said that he started the rumor of cannibalism in public and that in fact there was no evidence of anyone eating human flesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;phillymag.com&quot;/&gt;

Heidnik used electric shock as a form of torture. At one point, he forced three of his captives, bound in chains, into a pit. Heidnik ordered Josefina Rivera and another woman to fill the hole with water and then forced Rivera to help him apply electric current from a stripped extension cord to the women's chains. Deborah Dudley was fatally electrocuted, and Heidnik disposed of her body in the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|New Jersey Pine Barrens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tvguide.com&quot;/&gt;

On March 23, 1987, Heidnik and Rivera abducted Agnes Adams. The next day, Rivera convinced Heidnik to let her go, temporarily, in order to visit her family.  He drove her to a gas station and said he would wait for her there. She walked a block away and called 911.  She told the police the story and they were somewhat unconvinced at first.  The police made her repeat the story and she told it exactly the same way again. The responding officers, more convinced after they looked at her leg and noted the chafing from the chains, went to the gas station and arrested Heidnik. His purported best friend, Cyril (&quot;Tony&quot;) Brown, was also arrested. Brown was released on $50,000 bail and an agreement that he would testify against Heidnik. In part, Brown admitted to seeing Sandra Lindsay's death in the basement while in chains and Heidnik dismembering her.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19870813&amp;id=UuYlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jfwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3189,1807154|title=Gettysburg Times - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his arrest, Heidnik attempted to hang himself in his jail cell in April 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ACFRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K88MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2361,392691&amp;dq=gary+m+heidnik+suicide&amp;hl=en|title=Heidnik tries suicide|date=April 3, 1987|work=The Telegraph-Herald|page=2A|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and appeals===
At Heidnik's [[arraignment]], he claimed that the women were already in the house when he moved in.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Brian.

Gallagher, III. The fact that he had amassed approximately $550,000 in his bank and brokerage accounts was used to argue that he was not insane. Testimony from his Merrill Lynch financial advisor, Robert Kirkpatrick, was also used to prove competence. Kirkpatrick called Heidnik &quot;an astute investor who knew exactly what he was doing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bellamy&gt;Bellamy, Patrick.

In 1997, Heidnik's daughter, Maxine Davidson White, and his ex-wife, Betty Heidnik, filed suit in [[United States district court|federal court]] in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] seeking a [[stay of execution]] on the basis that Heidnik was not in fact [[Competence (law)|competent]] to be executed, despite the fact that only two days prior, the [[Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas]] had found that Heidnik ''was'' competent for execution. That ruling from the Court of Common Pleas contained 38 findings of fact attesting to Heidnik's competence. While Heidnik's daughter and ex-wife had filed the suit, Gary Heidnik himself was not a party to the action, and he had repeatedly asked courts to forego further delays and proceedings in his case that would needlessly prolong the period of time until his sentence could be carried out. In his ruling&lt;ref name=HeidnikvHornEDPa&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Heidnik v. Horn |vol=960 |reporter=F.Supp |opinion=74 |court=E.D.

[…] We conclude that we are without jurisdiction in this matter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Franklin Van Antwerpen]] cited the state court's ruling on Heidnik's competency and section 2254(e) of [[Title 28 of the United States Code|Title 28]] of the [[United States Code]] ({{USC|28|2254(e)}}), which provides that findings of state courts are to be presumed correct unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Since the state court had established that Heidnik was competent only two days earlier and since there was no reason to think Heidnik was suddenly incompetent, disabled, or otherwise unable to act on his own behalf, Van Antwerpen ruled that neither Heidnik's daughter nor his ex-wife had standing in the case. With no party with standing before the court, Van Antwerpen ruled that the court had no jurisdiction in the matter.&lt;ref name=HeidnikvHornEDPa/&gt; The district court's ruling was immediately appealed, and the very next day, April 17, 1997, attorneys for White and Betty Heidnik argued their case before a three judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]. The Third Circuit's decision, issued on April 18, 1997, [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] the district court's order with instructions to order the stay of execution.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite court |litigants=White v.

This final ruling from the district court effectively ended any recourse to the federal courts by Heidnik or on his behalf.

McGivern was tried with his partner in the robbery,  '''Charles Culhane''', and was sentenced to ten to twenty years in state prison.  On September 13, 1968, McGivern, Culhane and a third convict, Robert Bowerman, were being transported  by two [[deputy sheriff|deputies]], from [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn State Prison]] to a court hearing in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].  During a rest stop along the [[New York State Thruway]], a deputy's gun was seized in an attempted escape.  During the struggle inside the police car, a deputy and Bowerman were shot to death.&lt;ref name= &quot;NYT_1989-03-16&quot;&gt;{{ cite news

| quote= Gary McGivern, who had been sentenced to 25 years to life for the 1968 murder of a Westchester County deputy sheriff, was paroled yesterday, more than three years after Gov. Mario M. Cuomo granted him a controversial clemency.
| accessdate= 2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGivern and Culhane contended that Bowerman acted alone in the escape attempt, and that Bowerman killed the deputy.  Following one trial ending in a hung jury, a second trial in which they were sentenced to death, then a successful appeal of that death sentence, in a third trial they were found guilty of [[felony murder]] and sentenced to 25 years to life.  In a controversial New Year's Eve 1985 decision, New York Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] granted McGivern [[clemency]], and he was [[parole]]d three years later.&lt;ref name= &quot;NYT_1989-03-16&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
McGivern was born in [[Manhattan]], the son of Gertrude Burke and Thomas McGivern, who were both born and raised in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.  He attended Catholic schools and served in the [[United States Navy]].  He lived with his family in the [[Throgs Neck]] section of the Bronx.

McGivern’s first serious brush with the law was for marijuana possession in the [[Bronx]]. Culhane was his codefendant in a robbery of a gas station in Pelham, New York, in December 1966. Instead of accepting a plea bargain of five years in the case, McGivern chose to go to trial. The [[Westchester County]] court sentenced him to ten to twenty years in state prison. [[Sing Sing]] prison was McGivern's first destination and then upstate to [[Auburn Prison]] where he left for [[White Plains, New York]], Westchester's county seat, on September 13, 1968, to appear as a witness in a court hearing for Culhane.

==September 13, 1968==
On September 13, 1968, McGivern, Culhane and a third prisoner Robert Bowerman left Auburn prison with two deputies for a court hearing ordered by Westchester County Judge John C. Marbach, a former district attorney and trial lawyer. Marbach acted on Culhane’s [[coram nobis]] application to determine the validity of Culhane’s claim of improper sentencing in the Pelham Manor case. He approved a hearing on the matter.

Westchester County Sheriff Daniel F. McMahon sent two of his deputies—Joseph Singer and William Fitzgerald—to Auburn to pick up the three prisoners and deliver them to court in White Plains. McMahon was the former Public Safety Commissioner of [[Yonkers]] and a former chief of the criminal division of the office of the [[United States Attorney]] in New York. He had been elected Westchester’s county [[sheriff]] the previous January in 1968.

Robert Bowerman, a [[jailhouse lawyer]] at Auburn, prepared the [[coram nobis]] application for Culhane. Bowerman had a history of escape attempts. Although he claimed in the legal papers to have personal knowledge of Culhane’s case, Bowerman had never been arrested in Westchester County and had no association with the 1967 robbery case. An assistant  for the Westchester County DA’s office, B. Anthony Morosco, formally opposed Bowerman attending the hearing.

The five men left Auburn Prison on the morning of September 13 in a 1967 blue [[Chevrolet]] owned by Deputy Fitzgerald. It was not equipped with a security screen between the front and back seats. All five men dressed in plainclothes. The vehicle headed south on the [[New York State Thruway]].

On three occasions before lunch, Robert Bowerman requested that the deputies stop while he urinated along the side of the road. The deputies allowed Bowerman to leave the vehicle.

When the Chevrolet passed through Ulster County on the Thruway in the early afternoon, Robert Bowerman asked the deputies to stop the vehicle again. The sequence of what happened next became the source of considerable dispute over the next three decades in three trials, numerous appeals, the polygraph tests McGivern passed, news coverage and controversy surrounding the grant of executive clemency.

Deputy Sheriff William Fitzgerald and the prisoner Robert Bowerman were shot to death inside the car at Milepost 67.4. Culhane and McGivern maintained it was a solo escape attempt by Bowerman who was responsible for killing Deputy Fitzgerald. The surviving deputy Joseph Singer claimed McGivern shot Fitzgerald and that the escape attempt involved all three prisoners.
 
Culhane and McGivern were indicted for [[felony murder]], with attempted escape in the second degree as the underlying felony. The Ulster County Legislature passed a resolution on June 3, 1971 (Resolution 129) “that the office of the Ulster County Attorney be empowered to conduct a detailed legal investigation of the facts surrounding this crime to determine if there is sufficient grounds for instituting a [[negligence]] action against Westchester County, the Westchester County Sheriff and the State of New York for its statutory obligation.”

Ulster County’s legislators expected to be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the case, a crime which occurred within Ulster’s borders on the Thruway. Ulster County’s attempt to recoup damages was unsuccessful.

==Three trials in Ulster County, New York==
In an atmosphere of negative media coverage, the first trial in [[Kingston, New York]], in 1969 ended in a [[hung jury]].  “Editorials of the Air” were the trademark of a Kingston radio station managed by Harry Thayer, the son of the former commissioner of corrections of the State of New York, Dr. Walter N. Thayer Jr., who served the state from 1931 to 1936.  Harry Thayer broadcast controversial editorials on the air during all three Culhane-McGivern trials in Ulster County.

The juries in the Culhane-McGivern trials considered two versions of eyewitness testimony. In the investigation following the incident, the police did not conduct [[fingerprint]] tests on the weapons or other [[forensic]] tests which might have strengthened one eyewitness version of the account over the other.

Following the hung jury in 1969, Harry Thayer publicly admonished the jurors on the air for not returning a verdict, calling it an example of “Lace Panty Justice,” a term meaning “soft on crime”.

In the second trial in 1970 a jury found the defendants guilty, and Harry Thayer advocated for the death penalty on the air. The defendants were sentenced to death and sent to [[death row]] at Green Haven Correctional Facility across the Hudson River from Ulster County, where they remained in the death house for 33 months.

Defense attorneys filed an appeal brief citing negligence in the case investigation, inconsistencies in the testimony of Singer, the prosecution’s main witness, negative pretrial publicity, an unfair jury selection process, and denials of motions for a change of venue.

In October 1973 the [[New York State Court of Appeals]] unanimously overturned the convictions and death sentences, saying that four jurors who had shown a bias in favor of conviction should have been excused.&lt;ref name= &quot;NYT_1973-10-24&quot;&gt;{{ cite news

| date= 1973-10-24

| quote= The State Court of Appeals today reversed the conviction of two Bronx men sentenced to death for the 1968 slaying of a Westchester County deputy sheriff.
| accessdate= 2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision also noted that “Singer’s testimony. . .was inconsistent as to certain particulars” and “... the prosecutor’s evidence --taken in the context of this particular trial-- presented substantial questions of credibility for the jury’s consideration.” (October 23, 1973  decision, 33 N.Y. 2nd at 95 and n.1). The Court ordered a new trial.

The third trial, in March 1975, ended in convictions and sentences of 25 years to life. The Culhane-McGivern Defense Fund was sponsored by the folk singer [[Pete Seeger]], the poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] and the political commentator [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] The third trial conviction was upheld on appeal. Dissent highlighted the judge’s unfair charge to the jury and the suppression of Robert Bowerman’s prior history of escape attempts. Appeals attempting to overturn the third trial conviction were filed by attorneys Michael Tigar, [[William Kunstler]], Karen Peters, John Mage and John Privitera. The conviction was upheld but not without dissent.

==Executive clemency==
McGivern's and Culhane's paths now diverged.  They were sent to different prisons, McGivern to the [[Green Haven Correctional Facility]] and Culhane to the [[Attica Correctional Facility]], and elected to pursue different paths to gaining release.&lt;ref name= &quot;NYT_1980-03-28&quot;&gt;{{ cite news

| title= Clerics Explain Clemency Petition
| date= 1980-03-28
| publisher= [[The New York Times]]
| quote= An article in The New York Times last December 14 reported incorrectly that Charles Culhane, who was convicted with Gerald McGivern of the 1968 killing of a Westchester County deputy sheriff, was excluded from a petition seeking clemency for Mr. McGivern because &quot;he had not been sufficiently rehabilitated.&quot;
| accessdate= 2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGivern took and passed two [[polygraph]] tests in 1979 regarding his involvement in the crime. The tests were administered by Charles Jones, a member of the Case Review Committee of the American Polygraph Association and Lincoln Zonn, who had had his own company and polygraph institute for the previous 30 years. Zonn’s clients included the U.S. government and many law enforcement agencies. A group of religious leaders including the Green Haven prison [[chaplain]] presented a petition seeking [[clemency]] for McGivern.&lt;ref name= &quot;NYT_1980-03-28&quot;/&gt;  Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo formally recommended that New York Governor Hugh Carey commute McGivern’s sentence.  The district attorney of [[Ulster County]], Michael Kavanagh, publicly opposed the clemency recommendation throughout its lifetime.  Governor Carey declined to act on the recommendation.

Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, was elected governor of New York State in 1983. During his twelve years in office, he granted a total of 33 clemencies.  On December 31, 1985, he granted clemency to McGivern, an act that brought a firestorm of criticism from Republicans at state and national levels as well as from law enforcement personnel. The parole board granted McGivern parole three years later, and he was released on March 17, 1989, after 22 years in prison.

==Later life, death, and legacy==
McGivern was married to [[Marguerite Culp]], a reporter for the [[Woodstock Times]], from 1978 until 1991.

On June 13, 1994, McGivern was arrested for drug possession, a parole violation, and he was returned to prison.

He died of cancer in Albany Medical Hospital on November 19, 2001.

McGivern's papers are housed in the Special Collections of [[Lloyd Sealy Library]] at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuscript Collections|url=http://guides.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/content.php?pid=227219&amp;sid=1880539|publisher=Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections, John Jay College of Criminal Justice|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gary McGivern and Marguerite Culp Papers include correspondence, writings, journals, legal documents, news articles, artifacts, and photographs dating from 1967 to 2003.

'''Gary Ray Bowles''' (born January 25, 1962) is an American [[serial killer]] who was sentenced to death for the murder of six men.

==Early life==

Bowles was born in [[Clifton Forge, Virginia]], and was raised in [[Rupert, West Virginia]]. His father, &quot;Frank&quot;  who worked as a coal miner, had died from [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|Black Lung Disease]] six months before, and his mother, Frances  remarried several times. Bowles was [[child abuse|abused]] by his second stepfather, a violent [[alcoholic]] who also abused Bowles' mother and older brother.  The abuse continued until, at the age of 13, Bowles fought back and severely injured his stepfather. He left home soon after, angered by his mother's decision to remain in the marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Bell | first = Rachel | title = Gary Ray Bowles | work = truTV Crime Library | publisher = | url = http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/gary_bowles/index.html | accessdate = 4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} He was [[homeless]] for the next few years, earning money as a [[male prostitution|prostitute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}}

In 1982, he was arrested for beating and [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] his girlfriend, and was sentenced to six years in prison. In 1991, after his release from prison, he was convicted of unarmed robbery in the theft of an elderly woman's purse, a crime for which he was sentenced to four more years in prison; he was released in two.&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles.com&quot;&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2194/is_n12_v63/ai_16548140/ &quot;Gary Ray Bowles - murder suspect - VICAP Alert&quot;] ''Law Enforcement Bulletin'' December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
On April 14, 1994, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], Bowles killed his first known victim, John Hardy Roberts, who had offered him a temporary place to live. Bowles beat and strangled him to death, and then stole his [[credit card]]. Police soon considered him a suspect after finding his [[fingerprint]]s and [[probation]] records at the crime scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv&quot; /&gt;{{rp|4}} Over the next six months, Bowles murdered five other men in [[Nassau County, Florida]], [[Jacksonville, Florida]], [[Savannah, Georgia]], [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and [[Wheaton–Glenmont, Maryland|Wheaton]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]]. His typical ''[[modus operandi]]'' was to prostitute himself to his victims before beating and strangling them, and stealing their credit cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles.com&quot;/&gt; While on the run, Bowles was put on the [[FBI]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|list of the country's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives]] for his four known victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonboundserialkillers.com/gary_bowles |accessdate=January 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202033351/http://www.prisonboundserialkillers.com/gary_bowles |archivedate=December 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on October 22, 1994, Bowles was arrested for the murder of Walter Jamelle &quot;Jay&quot; Hinton, and confessed to all six murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv&quot; /&gt;

==Trial==
Bowles was found guilty of three counts of murder and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]], but the sentence was reversed by the [[Florida Supreme Court]]. He was given a new sentencing hearing, and again received the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = (Unofficial Transcript of oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court) Gary Ray Bowles vs State of Florida  | work = | publisher = WFSU | date = | url = http://www.wfsu.org/gavel2gavel/transcript/96732.htm | accessdate = 4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowles is held in [[Union Correctional Institution]] awaiting execution.

'''Gary Leon Ridgway''' (born February 18, 1949) is an [[List of serial killers in the United States|American]] [[serial killer]] known as the '''Green River Killer'''. He was initially convicted of 48 separate [[murder]]s and later confessed to nearly twice that number. As part of his [[plea bargain]], an additional [[conviction]] was added, bringing the total number of convictions to 49, making him the most prolific American serial killer in history according to confirmed murders. He murdered numerous women and girls in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Rachel|title=Green River Killer: River of Death|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/greenriver/bodies_6.html|publisher=Crime Library|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his victims were alleged to be [[prostitute]]s and other women in vulnerable situations, including underage runaways.

==Childhood==
Gary Leon Ridgway was born on February 18, 1949, in Salt Lake City, Utah. He was the second of Mary and Thomas Ridgway's three sons. His home life was somewhat troubled; relatives have described his mother as domineering and have said that young Ridgway witnessed more than one violent argument between his parents. His father was a bus driver who would often complain about the presence of prostitutes.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=River Of Death|first1=Terry|last1= McCarthy|first2=Nathan|last2=Thornburgh|date=June 3, 2002|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002555,00.html#ixzz21E1TjGvD|accessdate=July 20, 2012|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Ridgway was tested with an I.Q. of 82. When he was 16, he stabbed a six-year-old boy, who survived the attack. He had led the boy into the woods and then stabbed him through the ribs into his liver.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crime.about.com/od/serial/a/Gary-Ridgway.htm|title=Gary Ridgway: The Green River Killer|first=Charles|last=Montaldo| publisher=About.com|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult life==
Ridgway graduated from [[Tyee Educational Complex|Tyee High School]] at age 20 in 1969 and married his 19-year-old high school girlfriend Claudia Kraig. He joined the [[United States Navy|Navy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt; and was sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], where he served on board a [[auxiliary ship|supply ship]]&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Mark (2006). ''Defending Gary'', p. 117. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco; ISBN 0-7879-8106-0&lt;/ref&gt; and saw combat.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; During his time in the military, Ridgway began to have frequent sexual intercourse with numerous prostitutes and contracted [[gonorrhea]]. Although angered by this, he continued to have unprotected sex with prostitutes. While Ridgway was abroad, Kraig had an [[adultery|extramarital affair]]. The marriage ended within a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt;

When questioned about Ridgway after his arrest, friends and family described him as friendly but strange. His first two marriages resulted in divorce because of infidelities by both partners. His second wife, Marcia Winslow, claimed that he had placed her in a [[chokehold]].&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; He had become religious during his second marriage, proselytizing door-to-door, reading the Bible aloud at work and at home, and insisting that his wife follow the strict teachings of their church pastor.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt; Ridgway would also frequently cry after sermons or reading the Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/greenriver/threat_7.html?sect=2|title=Green River Killer: River of Death|first=Rachael|last=Bell|publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ridgway continued to solicit the services of prostitutes during this marriage. He also wanted his wife to participate in sex in public and inappropriate places, sometimes even in areas where his victims' bodies were later discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt;

According to women in his life, Ridgway had an insatiable sexual appetite.

==Murders==

[[File:Gary Ridgway 1982 Mugshot.jpg|thumb|left|Ridgway after a 1982 booking]]

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ridgway is believed to have murdered at least 71 women (according to Ridgway, in an interview with [[Dave Reichert|Sheriff Reichert]] in 2001) near [[Seattle]] and [[Tacoma, Washington]]. His court statements later reported that he had killed so many, he lost count. A majority of the murders occurred between 1982 and 1984. The victims were believed to be either [[prostitutes]] or runaways picked up along Pacific Highway South ([[Washington State Route 99|International Blvd. 99]]), whom he [[strangled]]. Most of their bodies were dumped in wooded areas around the [[Green River (Duwamish River)|Green River]], except for two confirmed and another two suspected victims found in the [[Portland, Oregon]] area. The bodies were often left in clusters, sometimes posed, usually nude. He would sometimes return to the victims' bodies and have [[necrophilia|sexual intercourse with them]]. Because most of the bodies were not discovered until only the [[skeleton]]s remained, three victims are still unidentified. Ridgway occasionally [[contaminated]] the dump sites with gum, cigarettes, and written materials belonging to others, and he even transported a few victims' remains across state lines into [[Oregon]] to confuse the police.&lt;ref name=MalengOR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/news/local/links/ridg_summary.pdf |title=Prosecutor's Summary of the Evidence, Case No. 01-1-10270-9 SEA; State of Washington vs. Gary Leon Ridgway; in the Superior Court of Washington for King County |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 2003 |website=seattletimes.nwsource.com |publisher=King County Prosecutor's Office |accessdate={{date|2014-11-11|mdy}} |quote=Ridgway acknowledged that, in an effort to throw off the Task Force, he moved Denise’s remains and those of Shirley Sherrill to Oregon in the spring of 1984. One weekend, he took his son on what he described as a “camping” trip to Oregon. He transported the remains, with son’s clothes and bicycle, in the trunk of a Plymouth Satellite. Ridgway paid cash for his food and gas on this trip and was careful not to leave any record linking him to Oregon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridgway began each murder by picking up a woman, usually a prostitute. He sometimes showed the woman a picture of his son, to trick her into trusting him. After raping her, Ridgway strangled her from behind. He initially strangled them manually. However, many victims inflicted wounds and bruises on his arm while trying to defend themselves. Concerned these wounds and bruises would draw attention, Ridgway began using [[Strangling#Ligature strangulation|ligatures]] to strangle his victims. He killed most victims in his home, his truck, or a secluded area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prothero 2006&quot;/&gt; In the early 1980s, the King County Sheriff's Office formed the Green River Task Force to investigate the murders. The most notable members of the task force were [[Robert Keppel]] and [[Dave Reichert]], who periodically interviewed incarcerated serial killer [[Ted Bundy]] from 1984. Bundy offered his opinions on the psychology, motivations, and behavior of the killer; he suggested that the killer was revisiting the dump sites to have sexual relations with his victims, which turned out to be true, and if police found a fresh grave, they should stake it out and wait for him to come back.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsTribune&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/2003/11/16/366398/like-minds-bundy-figured-ridgway.html|title=Like minds: Bundy figured Ridgway out|work=The News Tribune|date=November 16, 2003|accessdate=May 27, 2013|author=Robinson, Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also contributing to the investigation was [[John E. Douglas]], who has since written much on the subject of the Green River Killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2001801223_greenriver26m.html|title=Profiler can't recall why he said letter wasn't from Green River killer|work=The Seattle Times|date=November 26, 2003|accessdate=May 27, 2013|author=Wilson, Duff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridgway was arrested in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became a suspect in 1983 in the Green River killings. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a [[polygraph test]] (quality control protocols later developed in the FBI after careful review determined that Ridgway actually failed his polygraph test), and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and [[saliva]] samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a body in the carpet.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDDiscovery&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Married to a Monster|url=http://investigation.discovery.com/tv-schedules/series.html?paid=141.15118.129750.39540.3|series=Who the (BLEEP) Did I Marry?|network=[[Investigation Discovery]]|airdate=October 13, 2010|season=1|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the [[overtime]] pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway's crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she did not watch the news.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDDiscovery&quot;/&gt;

Author Pennie Morehead interviewed Ridgway in prison, and he said while he was in the relationship with Mawson his kill rate went down, and he truly loved her.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDDiscovery&quot;/&gt; Mawson told a local television reporter, &quot;I feel I have saved lives ... by being his wife and making him happy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KIRO&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Wife of Nation's Worst Serial Killer Shares Her Story |publisher= KIRO 7 Eyewitness News|url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/13362515/detail.html|date=May 22, 2007|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The samples collected in 1987 were later subjected to a [[DNA analysis]], providing the evidence for his arrest [[Warrant (law)|warrant]]. On November 30, 2001, Ridgway was at the Kenworth Truck factory, where he worked as a spray painter, when police arrived to arrest him. Ridgway was arrested on suspicion of murdering four women nearly 20 years after first being identified as a potential suspect, when [[DNA]] evidence conclusively linked [[semen]] left in the victims to the saliva swab taken by the police. The four victims named in the original [[indictment]] were Marcia Chapman, Opal Mills, Cynthia Hinds, and Carol Ann Christensen. Three more victims—Wendy Coffield, Debra Bonner, and Debra Estes—were added to the indictment after a forensic scientist identified [[microscopic]] spray paint spheres as a specific brand and composition of paint used at the Kenworth factory during the specific time frame when these victims were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDDiscovery&quot;/&gt;

==Plea bargain, confessions, sentencing==
Early in August 2003, [[Seattle]] television news reported that Ridgway had been moved from a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security]] cell at King County Jail to an Airway Heights Minimum-Medium Security Level Tank. Other news reports stated that his lawyers, led by Anthony Savage, were closing a [[plea bargain]] that would spare him the [[death penalty]] in return for his confession to a number of the Green River murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qctimes.com/news/national/with-guilty-pleas-killer-avoids-death-penalty/article_aa687bfb-4c55-555e-9e0b-df6246a0854f.html|title=With 48 Guilty Pleas, Killer avoids Death Penalty |access-date=February 25, 2017|newspaper=Quad-City Times|date=November 5, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2003, Ridgway entered a [[guilty plea]] to 48 charges of [[first degree murder|aggravated first degree murder]] as part of a plea bargain, agreed to in June, that would spare him execution in exchange for his cooperation in locating the remains of his victims and providing other details. In his statement accompanying his guilty plea, Ridgway explained that all of his victims had been killed inside King County, Washington, and that he had transported and dumped the remains of the two women near Portland to confuse the police.&lt;ref name=MalengOR /&gt;

Deputy prosecutor Jeffrey Baird noted in court that the deal contained &quot;the names of 41 victims who would not be the subject of ''State v. Ridgway'' if it were not for the [[plea agreement]].&quot; [[King County Prosecuting Attorney]] [[Norm Maleng]] explained his decision to make the deal:

{{quote|We could have gone forward with seven counts, but that is all we could have ever hoped to solve. At the end of that trial, whatever the outcome, there would have been lingering doubts about the rest of these crimes. This agreement was the avenue to the truth. And in the end, the search for the truth is still why we have a [[criminal justice system]] ... Gary Ridgway does not deserve our mercy. He does not deserve to live. The mercy provided by today's resolution is directed not at Ridgway, but toward the families who have suffered so much ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Norm|last=Maleng|title=Statement of Norm Maleng on Ridgway Plea|date=November 5, 2003|url=http://www.metrokc.gov/proatty/news/2003/RidgwPR5.htm|accessdate=June 23, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040626001014/http://www.metrokc.gov/proatty/news/2003/RidgwPR5.htm|archivedate=June 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} On December 18, 2003, [[King County Superior Court]] Judge Richard Jones sentenced Ridgway to 48 [[life imprisonment|life sentence]]s with no possibility of [[parole]] and one life sentence, to be served consecutively. He was also sentenced to an additional 10 years for [[tampering with evidence]] for each of the 48 victims, adding 480 years to his 48 life sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.seattleweekly.com/home/934121-129/crimepunishment|title=Gary Ridgway, Green River Killer, Charged With Murder #49, but Still Won't Face Execution |access-date=February 24, 2017|newspaper=Seattle Weekly|date=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridgway led prosecutors to three bodies in 2003. On August 16 of that year, the remains of a 16-year-old girl found near [[Enumclaw, Washington]], 40 feet from [[Washington State Route 410|State Route 410]], were pronounced as belonging to Pammy Annette Avent, who had been believed to be a victim of the Green River Killer. The remains of Marie Malvar and April Buttram were found in September. On November 23, 2005, [[Associated Press|The Associated Press]] reported that a weekend hiker found the [[human skull|skull]] of one of the 48 women Ridgway admitted murdering in his 2003 plea bargain with King County prosecutors. The skull of Tracy Winston, who was 19 when she disappeared from [[Northgate Mall (Seattle)|Northgate Mall]] on September 12, 1983, was found on {{date|2005-11-20|mdy}} by a man hiking in a wooded area near Highway 18 near [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]], southeast of Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Green |first=Sarah Jean |date={{date|2005-11-23}} |title=Remains of a Green River killer victim found near Issaquah |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002641105_greenriver23m.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate={{date|2014-11-12|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridgway confessed to more confirmed murders than any other American serial killer. Over a period of five months of police and prosecutor interviews, he confessed to 48 murders—42 of which were on the police's list of probable Green River Killer victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anitra Mulwee|url=http://www.karisable.com/grkmulwee.htm|publisher=karisable.com|accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2004, county prosecutors began to release the videotape records of Ridgway's confessions. In one taped interview, he told investigators initially that he was responsible for the deaths of 65 women, but in another taped interview with Reichert on December 31, 2003, Ridgway claimed to have murdered 71 victims and confessed to having had sex with them before killing them, a detail which he did not reveal until after his sentencing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cold Case Files 56&quot;&gt;''[[Cold Case Files]]'' Episode 56: &quot;Obsession: Dave Reichert and the Green River Killer&quot;, [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], original airdate: December 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his confession, he acknowledged that he targeted prostitutes because they were &quot;easy to pick up&quot; and that he &quot;hated most of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric|last=Hickey|title=Serial Murderers and Their Victims|year=2010|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confessed that he had sex with his victims' bodies after he murdered them, but claimed he began burying the later victims so that he could resist the urge to commit [[necrophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirotv.com/video/2833871/detail.html|title=Ridgway Reveals Gruesome Details In Chilling Confession|publisher=KIRO 7 Eyewitness News|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridgway talked to and tried to make his victims comfortable before he committed the murders. In his own words, &quot;I would talk to her... and get her mind off of the, sex, anything she was nervous about. And think, you know, she thinks, 'Oh, this guy cares'... which I didn't. I just want to, uh, get her in the vehicle and eventually kill her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cold Case Files 56&quot;/&gt;

Later in a statement Ridgway said that murdering young women was his &quot;career&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karisable.com/greenriver.htm|title=Green River Killer|publisher=Karisable.com|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life imprisonment==
Ridgway was placed in solitary confinement at [[Washington State Penitentiary]] in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]] in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find An Offender - Ridgway, Gary L.|url=http://www.doc.wa.gov/offenderinfo/default.aspx|publisher=Washington State Department of Corrections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly around 2005, Ridgway made more pleas with the Federal government and was transferred to Airway Heights where he was put in a minimum-medium security tank. On May 14, 2015, he was transferred to the [[United States Penitentiary, Florence High|USP Florence]], a high-security federal prison east of [[Cañon City, Colorado]]. In September 2015, after a public outcry and discussions with Gov. Jay Inslee, Corrections Secretary Bernie Warner announced that Ridgway would be transferred back to Washington to be “easily accessible” for open murder investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/green-river-killers-return-to-washington-may-not-bring-closure-to-victims-families/ Green River killer’s return to Washington may not bring closure to victims’ families], [[Seattle Times]], editorial, September 22, 2015. Retrieved 25 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Ridgway was returned by chartered plane to Washington from the [[United States Penitentiary, Florence High|High Security Federal Prison]] in Florence, Colorado, on October 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://q13fox.com/2015/10/24/dept-of-corrections-gary-ridgway-returned-to-washington-state-penitentiary/ Department of Corrections: Gary Ridgway returned to Washington State Penitentiary], [[KCPQ|q13 Fox]], John White, October 24, 2015.

&lt;!-- NOTE: Please do not add Rebecca Marrero to this section. She is listed above. --&gt;

[[File:Green River Jane Does.jpg|thumb|Jane Doe B-10 ''(left)'' and Jane Doe B-17 are two of three unidentified victims of Ridgway. Their faces were reconstructed digitally to assist in their identification.]]

* Before Ridgway's confession, authorities had not attributed to the Green River Killer the deaths of victims Rule, Barczak, Hayes, Reeves, Yellowrobe and 'victim 49'.&lt;ref name =&quot;Task Force List&quot; /&gt;
* Ridgway's confession and directions led police search crews to find the bodies of Avent, Buttram, and Malvar in August and September 2003.
* On Tuesday, December 21, 2010, hikers near the West Valley Highway in Auburn, WA found a skull in the vicinity of where Marie Malvar's remains were found in 2003. The skull was identified as belonging to Rebecca &quot;Becky&quot; Marrero, who was last seen leaving the Western Six Motel at South 168th Street and Pacific Highway South on December 3, 1982. The King County Prosecutor confirmed that Ridgway would be formally charged with her murder on February 11, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;49th victim&quot; /&gt; On February 18, 2011, he entered a guilty plea in the murder of Rebecca Marrero, adding a 49th life sentence to his existing 48. Ridgway confessed to murdering Marrero in his original plea bargain, but due to insufficient evidence, the charges could not be filed. Therefore, there is no change in his current incarceration status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014154781_ridgway08m.html |title=Attorney: Ridgway will likely plead guilty to new murder charge |work=Seattle Times |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |first=Jennifer |last=Sullivan |date=February 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209073021/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com:80/html/localnews/2014154781_ridgway08m.html |archivedate=February 9, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The remains of Tracy Winston were found, without a skull, in [[Kent, Washington|Kent]]'s [[Cottonwood Grove Park]] in March 1986. Winston's skull was found in November 2005 near Tiger Mountain, miles away from the discovery site of the rest of her body. Police assume someone carried it to the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Castro, Hector|title=Skull of Woman Killed by Ridgway Found but It Turned Up Miles from the Rest of Her Remains|journal=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date=November 23, 2005|page=  B1|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Skull-of-woman-killed-by-Ridgway-found-1188155.php| accessdate= August 10, 2010}} LexisNexis.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sandra Denise Major was not identified until June 2012. A family member asked the King County Sheriff to investigate after seeing a TV movie about Ridgway. DNA confirmed Major's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Victim of Green River killer identified 30 years later after relative sees TV movie|date=June 19, 2012|work=Fox News |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/06/19/victim-green-river-killer-identified-30-years-later-after-relative-sees-tv/?intcmp=obnetwork#ixzz1yG05cv8T|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/wash-officials-green-river-killer-victim-idd-094835086.html|title=Wash. officials say Green River Killer victim ID'd|publisher=Yahoo.com|agency=Associated Press|date=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jane Doe B-10, discovered on March 21, 1984, is currently unidentified. Ridgway claimed that she was a white female in her early twenties and possibly had brown hair. Examination of the remains suggested that she was actually between twelve and eighteen, most likely around fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe B-10|url=http://greenriverkillings.com/jane-doe-b10|website=greenriverkillings.com|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the victim's skeleton indicated she was probably left-handed, and had at one point in her life suffered a healed skull fracture to the left temple.
* Jane Doe B-17, also unidentified, was discovered on January 2, 1986; remains that had been found in another area February 18, 1984 were later matched to this victim. Ridgway claimed responsibility for her death in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe B-17|url=http://greenriverkillings.com/jane-doe-b-17/|website=greenriverkillings.com|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jane Doe B-20, a female between thirteen and twenty-four, was discovered in August 2003. Due to the fact that the remains were partial, her face could not be reconstructed and her race could not be determined. She was murdered between the twenty-year span of 1973 to 1993, but is believed to have been murdered during the first decade of Ridgway's murder spree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe B-20|url=http://greenriverkillings.com/jane-doe-b20|website=greenriverkillings.com|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Task force victims list===
Ridgway is suspected of—but not charged with—murdering the remaining six victims of the original list attributed to the Green River Killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Task Force List&quot;/&gt; In each case, either Ridgway did not confess to the victim's death, or authorities have not been able to corroborate their suspicion with reliable evidence.

* Seattle native [[Tammy Vincent]], who disappeared in 1979, was later thought to be a possible victim of Ridgway. In 1979, her body had been found stabbed and shot to death in [[Tiburon, California]]. Her remains were not identified until 2007. He did not confirm involvement in her death, which was likely caused by a different person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolfcale|first1=Joe|title=Victim in 1979 Tiburon murder finally identified|url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_7041839|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ridgway denied killing Amina Agisheff. Agisheff does not fit the [[victimology|profile]] of any of the victims of the Green River Killer considering her age, and she was not a prostitute or a teenage runaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/2003/11/16/366398/like-minds-bundy-figured-ridgway.html |title=Like minds: Bundy figured Ridgway out|work=The News Tribune|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although he has never been charged with her murder, during police interrogations in 2003, Ridgway did confess to killing Kase Ann Lee (Woods). He stated that he strangled Lee in 1982 and left her body near a drive-in theatre off the [[Washington State Route 99|Sea-Tac Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900411&amp;slug=1065957|work=Seattle Times|accessdate=June 17, 2010|title=Cleaning Up Sea-Tac Strip -- Officials Target Prostitution, Dance Clubs|first=Linda W.Y.|last=Parrish|date=April 11, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officials have been unable to locate Lee's remains at the dump site that Ridgway indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guillen|first=T.|title=Serial Killers: Issues Explored Through the Green River Murders|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence exists to suggest that Ridgway murdered Kelly Kay McGinniss. Shortly before her disappearance, McGinniss was questioned by a Port of Seattle police officer while &quot;dating&quot; Ridgway near the [[SeaTac, Washington|SeaTac]] Strip. Furthermore, during the summer of 2003, Ridgway led authorities to the bodies of several of his victims. One of those bodies (later identified as that of April Buttram) was initially identified by Ridgway as being that of McGinness. According to Ridgway, he often confused McGinness with Buttram because of their similar physiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prothero|first1= M.|last2=Smith|first2=C.|title=Defending Gary: Unraveling the Mind of the Green River Killer|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2006|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ridgway is a suspect in the deaths of Angela Marie Girdner and Tammie Liles. Their bodies were discovered within a mile of the bodies of known victims Shirley Shirell and Denise Bush. Liles remained unidentified until 1998 and Girdner until October 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/12/16/green.river.killer/index.html|work=CNN|title=Police identify remains, look for link to 'Green River Killer'|accessdate=May 3, 2010|date=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspected===
Ridgway has been considered a suspect in the disappearances/murders of five other women not attributed at the time to the Green River Killer. No charges have been filed.

'''Gary Tyler''' (born July 1958) from [[St. Rose, Louisiana]] is a former prisoner in [[Louisiana]]. He was imprisoned  from 1975 until April 29, 2016 having been convicted aged 17 of the 1974 shooting death of a 13-year-old white boy. Originally sentenced to death, Tyler was the youngest prisoner on death row.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] ruled the trial was &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot;. Tyler's cause has been taken up by human rights organizations, as well as many other supporters, including a range of sports figures and organizations in 2007.

==Events==
In 1974 formerly all-white [[Destrehan High School]] had been full of tensions as it reluctantly integrated, 20 years after the ruling of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.  Because of fights, officials closed the school early during the day of the events.

Black students were sent home on their regular bus. On October 17, 1974, Tyler was 16 and on the bus. As they were leaving Destrehan High School, the bus was attacked by an angry mob of 100-200 whites, mostly students. The whites were angry about integration and tensions at the school.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/allen08262006.html  Joe Allen, &quot;Free Gary Tyler&quot;], ''Counterpunch'', 26/27 Aug 2006, accessed 16 Jul 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Weber, a 13-year-old boy standing outside the bus with other classmates, was shot and fatally wounded. He later died. Police searched the bus, but no gun was ever found.

Tyler was arrested and charged with the murder of 13-year-old Weber. His mother Juanita Tyler has said that he was beaten by the police in an attempt to make him confess. Other witnesses later told of being intimidated by the police.

The racially charged atmosphere was heightened with the arrival in Destrehan of [[David Duke]], who was emerging as a leader in the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and neo-Nazi politics in the United States. He brought what he called security teams to protect white residents.

==Conviction==
[[File:LSPEntrance-.jpg|thumb|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]], where Tyler was held]]
Tyler was tried as an adult and convicted at trial in 1975 by an [[all-white jury]] in a [[Louisiana]] state court. Observers thought the case was marked by several flaws and alleged lack of experience of his lawyer. As [[Bob Herbert]] wrote in 2007 in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the lawyer &quot;had never handled a murder case, much less a [[death penalty]] case. He kept his meetings with his client to a minimum and would later complain about the money he was paid.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

At the trial, the police produced a gun they claimed to have found on the bus. But, in the decades following the conviction, the gun disappeared from the evidence room.

Under Louisiana law, since it was a capital case, after conviction Tyler was sentenced to death by [[electric chair|electrocution]]. He became the youngest inmate on [[death row]] when he entered prison.

In 1977, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Louisiana's death penalty was unconstitutional. Tyler's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment without parole. He served his sentence at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] in [[Angola, Louisiana|Angola]].

Having served 41 years (two of them on death row), Tyler was  freed on April 29, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldcourier.com/news/after-more-than-decades-in-prison-gary-tyler-finally-free/article_a6722cf2-63ea-554b-9173-9170db8f7367.html?mode=jqm|title=After more than 4 decades in prison, Gary Tyler finally free|work=HeraldCourier.com|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Tyler's case was appealed.  In 1980 and 1981 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] ruled the trial was &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot; and flawed by the judge making an improper charge to the jury. The second time, after an appeal by the state, the Appeals Court reversed its earlier ruling and called for a retrial, based on what it said was attorney error, but changed its recommendation on a technical issue.

In 1989 the Louisiana Board of Appeals recommended a pardon, but Governor Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Roemer, a Democrat, was running against David Duke for election, and refused to consider it in a racially charged election.  He feared such a decision would not be favored by voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zirin&quot;&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070402/zirin Dave Zirin, &quot;Gary Tyler's Quest for Justice&quot;], ''The Nation'', 21 Mar 2007, accessed 16 Jul 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Human-rights organisations have argued that the legal process and procedures were flawed by the racially charged atmosphere and police intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/allen08262006.html Joe Allen: Free Gary Tyler&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the racial and political issues of the time, in 1994 [[Amnesty International]] described Tyler as a &quot;political prisoner&quot;. &lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In 2007 [[Bob Herbert]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote three columns about the case and the injustice against Tyler. His work helped raise the visibility of Tyler's plight, and [[Amnesty International]], a coalition of sports figures, and other groups made a renewed effort to gain a pardon by Gov. [[Kathleen Blanco]] before she left office. She failed to consider the case. Tyler by then had served 32 years in prison.

Tyler's supporters have claimed that there was a miscarriage of justice in his case. Some of the issues include:

* The bus driver has insisted that he believes the shot was fired from outside of the bus. &lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/01/1429239|title=The Case of Gary Tyler: Despite Witness Recantations and No Physical Evidence, Louisiana Prisoner Remains Jailed After 32 Years|work=Democracy Now!|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The bus driver observed the search of the bus, and said that no gun was found on it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
* The gun which the police claim was used in the murder (and produced as evidence at the trial), was a Colt .45 government-issue, identified as having been stolen from the firing range used by the officers of the sheriff's department.  The gun later disappeared from the evidence room.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.freegarytyler.com/writings/a-death-in-destrehan.html Bob Herbert, &quot;A Death in Destrehan&quot;], reprinted by permission of ''New York Times'', 1 Feb 2007, accessed 16 Jul 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* The jury for Tyler's trial was all white.
* The 1981 US Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, ruled that the trial was &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot;, flawed by the judge's improper charge to the jury.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.freegarytyler.com/writings/gary-tylers-lost-decades.html Bob Herbert, &quot;Gary Tyler's Lost Decades&quot;], reprinted by permission of ''New York Times'', 5 Feb 2007, accessed 16 Jul 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* Four major witnesses against Tyler have recanted their testimony since the trial. Some claimed they were terrorized and pressured by police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
* Based on Tyler's positive work in prison, the Louisiana Board of Pardons three times recommended his being freed. Governors failed to act on his case or rejected pardons, once during an election campaign against David Duke.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Popular culture==
* [[Gil Scott-Heron]] sang about Tyler in the song &quot;Angola, Louisiana,&quot; on the 1978 album ''[[Secrets (Gil Scott-Heron album)|Secrets]]''.
* British reggae band [[UB40]] opened their 1980 debut album, ''[[Signing Off]]'' with the song &quot;Tyler&quot;. The song name-checks the subject only as &quot;Tyler&quot;. Ali Campbell said in an interview in August 2007 that the next UB40 album would be named ''Gary Tyler''; in fact, the band's next album, in 2008, was titled ''[[TwentyFourSeven (UB40 album)|TwentyFourSeven]]'', but did revisit the subject of Tyler's imprisonment on the song &quot;Rainbow Nation&quot;.
* The British band [[Chumbawamba]] included the song &quot;Waiting for the Bus&quot; on their 2008 album ''[[The Boy Bands Have Won]]''. The song tells the story from the imagined view of Tyler.

Joe decides to use his knowledge of the Galactor society to help save the human race. Joe single-handedly infiltrates the Galactor headquarters and manages to transmit its coordinates to the Gatchaman moments before he is captured by Solaris and his henchman.

Meanwhile the Gatchaman group teams up with Red Impulse to attack the Galactor's home base – it's a brutal fight to the death in which both the Gatchaman and the Red Impulse will pay the ultimate price. In the end-credits, it turns out that the Gatchaman team survived thanks to a miracle.

==Design==
In the OVA series, the characters' designs and ages were changed along with other elements as part of the process of &quot;updating&quot; the series for modern audiences. Ken, who had long hair in the original series, was given short hair. Joe was redesigned with more of a &quot;bad boy&quot; image, given a tattoo and made a smoker — His car was also updated to a [[Shelby Cobra]]. Jun originally had long green hair but has short brown hair in the OVA, has developed physically and has worked as a model in the past. Jinpei is renamed as Jimmy and given more of a &quot;street kid&quot; look while his position on the team becomes &quot;hacker&quot;. Ryu is now the oldest at 25, he was originally 17, and his hairstyle is changed to a blonde and purple mohawk. The GodPhoenix was also redesigned and appears to be larger than the original.

{{Nihongo|'''''Gatchaman Crowds'''''|ガッチャマンクラウズ|Gatchaman Kurauzu}} is a 2013 [[anime]] television series produced by [[Tatsunoko Production]] and directed by Kenji Nakamura. The first season aired between July 12, 2013 and September 27, 2013, and the second season, titled ''Gatchaman Crowds insight'', started with a prologue episode streamed on [[Hulu]] on June 20, 2015 before first airing on July 4, 2015 and finishing on September 26, 2015.

==Plot==
The series takes place in the early summer of 2015 and is set in the city of Tachikawa, Japan. A &quot;second metropolis&quot; of Tokyo, Tachikawa is protected by the ''Gatchaman'', warriors who fight in special reinforced suits powered by the manifestation of their spiritual powers called NOTE. Following the introduction of their newest member, the energetic and cheerful Hajime Ichinose, the Gatchaman must deal with Berg Katze, an enigmatic alien creature bent on destroying Earth just like it did with several other planets in the past.

One year after Berg Katze is stopped, the CROWDS system developed by Rui Ninomiya, a computer specialist who also becomes part of the Gatchaman, has spread among the Japanese society, shortening the gap between the population and the government. However, this new era of peace is threatened by the mysterious organization &quot;VAPE,&quot; calling the Gatchaman to action once more, including a new member, the impulsive Tsubasa Misudachi, who becomes Hajime's new partner.

==Characters==

===Gatchaman===
;{{nihongo|Hajime Ichinose|一ノ瀬 はじめ|Ichinose Hajime}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchamanCast&quot; /&gt; /(G-101)
:{{voiced by|[[Maaya Uchida]]|[[Jessica Calvello]]}}
:The protagonist, a 16-year-old high school girl living in Tachikawa City, who is a new member of the G-Crew. She is lively and energetic, has an artistic spirit and a peculiar way of talking as well as an inventive point of view. She is an avid collector of [[stationery]] and usually gets overly excited when she finds an item that piques her interest. She is put under the responsibility of Sugane, but usually disobeys his orders and acts on her own. Her actions, despite seeming irresponsible at first, usually bring positive and unexpected results never before seen in Gatchaman activity as shown when she manages to communicate with the MESS and free all the humans it had previously absorbed. After learning about Berg Katze, she attempts to understand him while simultaneously opposing his plan to make the world burn by revealing to the public that the Gatchaman exist and supporting Rui in his attempt to retake control over the CROWDS and X from the alien. Mysteriously, however, she is last shown merged with Berg Katze in the ending of the first season with no explanation provided until the director's cut was released, showing how she was able to catch the alien off guard by finally seeing that he was actually inside everyone the whole time, shearing his long hair with her scissors and then shoving his NOTE into her chest after kissing him.

:In ''Insight'' she becomes responsible for mentoring Tsubasa as a new Gatchaman. Curiously one of the rare ones (besides Yuruji) to produce a white speech balloon upon Gelsadra using his powers, Hajime shows serious doubts upon learning of Tsubasa and Gelsadra's plan to unite everybody as one mind in order to avoid any form of conflict, eventually teaching them that having individuality and the occasional conflicts that come from it is what makes people human. In order to defeat the seemlingly endless army of Kuu-samas and save Gelsadra, she devises a plan to give the public a live broadcast of Gelsadra being executed by the Gatchaman, as they desired, but in actuality the Gelsadra they witnessed was actually her under a disguise created using Berg Katze's powers, falling into a coma from the serious injuries she sustained. As a result the public realises how drastic their desires have become, killing off the mood, which eliminates most of the Kuu-sama along with it. After a month-long election to allow the public to rethink their views on Gelsadra, which concludes in him being allowed to stay, she wakes up to everyone's happiness.

:Hajime's Gatchaman form has the appearance of girl with pink pigtails and fights with large scissors and other stationery-based tools. She possesses the white {{nihongo|Designer's NOTE|デザイナーのNOTE|Dezainā no Nōto}}, and gains Berg Katze's Schadenfreude NOTE after fusing herself with him. Her original NOTE and Gatchaman form takes on red accents after fusing with Katze, and her Gatchaman form's face switches from blue eyes to a red smile when Katze is in command.

;{{nihongo|Sugane Tachibana|橘 清音|Tachibana Sugane}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchamanCast&quot; /&gt;(G-96)
:{{voiced by|[[Ryōta Ōsaka]]|Corey Hartzog}}
:A serious, dutiful young man whose bearing is similar to that of a [[samurai]]. He has a strong sense of justice and is devoted to doing his job as a Gatchaman properly at the expense of enjoying his life as much as he could. He always carries his katana with him wherever he goes. He has been with the G-Crew for five years and is baffled by Hajime when she first joins, leaving him to think of things he had never thought were possible. Initially, he finds Hajime annoying and inconsiderate, but over time he begins to understand her more and become influenced by her behavior to the extent that he later approaches J.J. to tell him they no longer need his predictions as they can handle the situation involving Berg Katze by themselves. Among the members of the G-Crew, he respects Joe greatly and several flashbacks reveal that Joe had saved him from the MESS as a child. The incident left a strong, lasting impression on Sugane when Joe told him to one day save someone like he had done, which led up to Sugane becoming a member of the G-Crew afterward. In the second season, Sugane starts wearing glasses and attends the local university where he has gained a number of female fans, but he later gets disappointed on them upon knowing that they were not their true friends and were just hanging out with him because he was a Gatchaman.

:Sugane's Gatchaman form is modeled after a swan and relies on [[Iaijutsu]] techniques. His Gatchaman form also displays incredible agility and the ability to stand on walls and ceilings. He possesses the black {{nihongo|Infinite Reach NOTE|無限間合のNOTE|Mugen Maai no Nōto}}.

;{{nihongo|Joe Hibiki|枇々木 丈|Hibiki Jō}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchamanCast&quot; /&gt;(G-89)
:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]|Ty Mahany}}
:A Tokyo University graduate who has been on the G-Crew for 10 years. He is aloof, cynical and has a low sense of self-esteem with seemingly little interest in doing his job as a Gatchaman. Despite his listlessness, he is revealed to have previously saved Sugane from the MESS in the past as well as mentoring him when he first joined. After encountering Berg Katze some time after Hajime joins the G-Crew, he realizes the danger the alien poses to humanity and focuses on defeating him. However, he ends up losing badly to Berg Katze in their following fight, and gives up on trying again until Sugane eventually reaches out to him, thanking Joe for saving him and reviving his enthusiasm and passion for work by reminding him of what it means to be a hero. He works for the &quot;Living Safety Department&quot; of the town hall during the day, while wearing glasses and maintaining a clean, handsome appearance. However, at night, he lets his hair down (revealing some inner orange hair), removes his glasses, and becomes a heavy drinker and smoker, though he gives up smoking and starts consuming lollipops during ''Insight''. He also plays darts regularly and has stated his dream is world peace. In ''Insight'' he has become the mayor's secretary and opposes Rui in allowing the public to use the CROWDS after seeing the harm they are capable of when Rizumu's red CROWDS terrorize a city. As a result, he assists Gelsadra in his run for prime minister in order to abolish them.

:Joe's Gatchaman form is modeled after an [[oni]] and can manipulate flames, fly using jet propulsion, and launch its forearms. He possesses the red {{nihongo|Explosive Flame NOTE|爆炎のNOTE|Bakuen no Nōto}}

;{{nihongo|O.D|O・D|Ō Dī}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchmanCast2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gatchaman Crowds Unveils 7 More Characters|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2013-06-07/gatchaman-crowds-unveils-7-more-characters|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;/(G-12)
:{{voiced by|Daisuke Hosomi|[[Clint Bickham]]}}
:A half-alien who runs the CAGE &amp;mdash; the Gatchaman base of operations &amp;mdash; in addition to being a part of the G-Crew. O.D. usually displays a flamboyant, playful personality when around others, but possesses a grim, serious demeanor that is shown upon discovering Berg Katze has arrived to spread chaos among the human race. O.D. is often accompanied by a cat named {{nihongo|Altair|アルタイル|Arutairu}}, called &quot;Al&quot; for short. O.D. also gets along very well with Utsutsu, who at first opens up only when the two of them are together. They are roommates and seem close like a family.

:O.D. has the self-appointed title of &quot;a sad Gatchaman who can't transform&quot;, thus rendering the half-alien unable to participate in missions. Later, it is revealed that O.D's Gatchaman powers are so strong, the entire world could be destroyed when they are activated, and those powers were in fact responsible for destroying O.D's father's planet in the past. O.D. eventually confronts Berg Katze after the alien wreaks havoc in Tachikawa City and uses those powers in the fight against Katze. Despite sustaining heavy injuries in the battle O.D. manages to subdue Berg Katze for a while and retrieve Rui's NOTE in order to return it to Rui and resolve the conflict. O.D. possesses the green {{nihongo|NOTE of Destruction|崩壊のNOTE|Hōkai no Nōto}}. In ''Insight'' O.D. has become a regular guest of the popular Millione Show and provides commentary on ongoing issues such as the CROWDS.

;{{nihongo|Utsutsu Miya|宮 うつつ|Miya Utsutsu}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchmanCast2&quot; /&gt;/(G-99)
:{{voiced by|[[Kotori Koiwai]]|[[Carli Mosier]]}}
:A first-year student attending the Tachikawa Private Academy for the Gifted. She has been part of the G-Crew for two years. She works as a volunteer taking care of the flowers at the Tachikawa City International Greenery Garden. She does not have a very positive image of herself, and fears getting closer to others because she thinks her powers would scare them away. The only one she can initially speak to normally is O.D, with whom she lives, though she eventually warms up to others after Hajime approaches her and encourages her to accept herself. She appears to be fond of making [[origami]], as she is shown happily folding a red piece of paper that Hajime gives her into the shape of a frog. Her catchphrase, and just about the only thing she would originally say to anyone is &quot;{{nihongo|I'm gloomy|うつうつします|Utsuutsu shimasu}}&quot;, which is a pun on her name. She usually wears a bikini while in the Gatchaman's base, the CAGE, and tends to the plants inside. In ''Insight'' she assists Paiman in taking care of the children in his new daycare and later goes out to help his political campaign when he tries running for prime minister.

:Utsutsu has the ability to create perfect, independent copies of herself, which are connected to her by a mild mental link, effectively allowing her to be in multiple places at once. She also exhibits an ability to drain life energy from living things with her right hand and give it to others with her left, though overusing the latter puts her life at risk unless she takes life force from something else. This trait also carries over to her Gatchaman form, modeled after a girl wearing a hooded outfit, which possesses two extendable arms ending in large, clawed hands. She possesses the chartreuse {{nihongo|NOTE of Life and Death|誕生と死のNOTE|Tanjō to Shi no Nōto}}.

;{{nihongo|Paiman|パイマン}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchmanCast2&quot; /&gt;/(G-3)
:{{voiced by|[[Aya Hirano]]|[[Luci Christian]]}}
:The team leader, a choleric alien Gatchaman dispatched on Earth by J.J., and the longest running member of the G-Crew, going back hundreds of years. Paiman has complete trust and respect for J.J. and his prophecies and gives the team orders largely based on those prophecies. Paiman demands respect, tact, and obedience from its fellow Gatchaman, but its outbursts of anger are often ignored, especially by Hajime. A heavy drinker, Paiman often drowns its sorrows and confides about its worries to fellow alien and good friend O.D. Paiman has a similar appearance to a panda, but dislikes being referred to as one. Despite this, it has a large collection of panda merchandise stashed in its room.

:Its anxiety makes it hard for it to question orders and take action beyond the usual proceedings. Its anxiety worsens when Berg Katze appears because of personal history with the alien. Influenced by its fears, Paiman ran away scared when about to be confronted with Katze, leaving Hajime and Utsutsu behind. However, its determination to protect humankind grows while making friends with the children of a local kindergarten. This determination leads to Paiman charging into battle alongside the team when Tachikawa was under attack by the Neo Hundred CROWDS, with Paiman's eyes notably switching from black to a light grey colour. In ''Insight'' it opens up a new daycare center and after seeing Gelsadra, an alien, running for prime minister, Paiman attempts to run as well but gets in trouble for bribing voters with stuffed pandas, and later loses to Gelsadra.

:Paiman's Gatchaman form is a large beast able convert to a wheeled vehicle form that travels at high speeds and carries other passengers. Paiman possesses the pink {{nihongo|Universal Transformation NOTE|変換自在のNOTE|Henkan Jizai no Nōto}}

;{{nihongo|Rui Ninomiya|爾乃美家 累|Ninomiya Rui}}/(G-100)&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchmanCast2&quot; /&gt;
:{{voiced by|[[Ayumu Murase]]|[[Shannon Emerick]]}}
:A young adult living on the top floor in the high-class mansion-apartment building Glorious Tower Toyosu in Tokyo's Koto ward. His trump card is his superb intellect. He is trilingual, being able to speak English, Japanese, and Chinese. After educating himself using educational websites and learning how to write code from hackers around the world, he developed the social networking service &quot;GALAX&quot; with over 200 million users worldwide. He believes that the current society is flawed and claims that it is his duty to improve it for the better, thus &quot;upgrading the world&quot;. When in public, Rui dresses usually as a blonde girl in punk rocker fashion, and is known by GALAX users as LOAD. Among GALAX users, Rui selected one hundred individuals, known as The Hundred, to use a system known as CROWDS to assist in disasters. Upon meeting Hajime and confirming the existence of Gatchaman, Rui attempts to persuade her, Utsutsu and Sugane to stop being Gatchaman, as the concept of &quot;superheroes&quot; would be obsolete in the upgraded world. Rui also believes that people would become too reliant on Gatchaman to solve problems and prevent disasters. After Katze takes over the GALAX network using his form, Rui joins the Gatchaman in an attempt to thwart him. After Berg Katze is stopped, Rui allows the CROWDS system to be used by any individual, ushering a new time of peace and prosperity for the country, until the appearance of the VAPE organization in ''Insight'', which shows the world the dangers such powers could cause in wrong hands in order to undermine it.

:Rui also possesses his own NOTE, with a different logo on the cover due to it being extracted by Berg Katze instead of J.J, but he refrains from using its powers despite Berg's attempts to make him do so. Later on its logo changes to the same one seen on those used by the G-Crew when O.D returns it to him after it was stolen by Berg Katze, indicating he has officially become one of them. As a Gatchaman, Rui has the power to travel instantly from a place to another through communication systems and open portals for the other Gatchamen to use, as well as dealing powerful electric attacks. He possesses the purple {{nihongo|Codec NOTE|コーデックのNOTE|Kōdekku no Nōto}}.

;{{nihongo|Tsubasa Misudachi|三栖立 つばさ|Misudachi Tsubasa}}/(G-60)
:{{voiced by|[[Kaori Ishihara]]|Chelsea McCurdy}}
:A 16-year-old second year high school student from Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture. She joins the G-Crew in the second season and becomes Hajime's new partner. She has an impulsive personality and slips into her home city's dialect when angry. Her dream is to become a pyrotechnician like her great-grandfather. She hates conflict, and as a result of meeting Gelsadra, who shares her ideals, she becomes his best friend and supporter, helping him become and even after he becomes prime minister. However, realizing how her influence caused Gelsadra to produce the Kuu-samas which are doing more harm than good, she seeks advice from her great-grandfather, who points out her greatest flaw was always taking in too much of atmosphere that she does not breathe properly to release the tension and think things through. This flaw was also the cause her being unable to transform into a Gatchaman at will, only subconsciously transforming when she gets angry. After clearing the issue up, she finally manages to properly transform to aid the other Gatchaman in defeating the Kuu-samas.

:Her Gatchaman form is modelled after a girl with long black hair, wearing a cat-like helmet. Her powers are based on fireworks, and has the ability to convert herself into the hoverbike-like Matsukaze form. She possesses the blue {{nihongo|Flash NOTE|閃光のNOTE|Senkō no Nōto}}.

;{{nihongo|J.J. Robinson|J・J・ロビンソン|Jē Jē Robinson}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchmanCast2&quot; /&gt;
:{{voiced by|[[Katsuji Mori]]|[[Leraldo Anzaldua]]}}
:A member of the board of trustees, and the guardian of Earth. He is a man who has looked after lives born in the galaxy for many years. With the power to create NOTES from the essence of other beings, he chooses select individuals to join the Gatchaman and assigns missions to them based on his forecasts. He claims that there is an enemy existence that will be impossible to repel with the powers of science. J.J. is often seen making origami birds, each one representing a member of the G-Crew or another major player in the conflict. J.J. is portrayed by the same actor who voiced Ken the Eagle from the original series in the 1970's.

===Antagonists===
;{{nihongo|Berg Katze|ベルク・カッツェ|Beruku Kattse}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchmanCast2&quot; /&gt;
:{{voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]|[[David Wald]]}}
:An androgynous, mysterious alien with a diamond-patterned tail who is named after a main villain from the original series. Katze has the power to assume anyone's identity by kissing them, which the alien uses to frame people for various crimes. Katze also displays powers of levitation and teleportation. Both Paiman and OD seem to know about Katze, and according to them, Berg Katze is a malicious being whose purpose is to destroy all life in the universe by turning the individuals of the planets Katze attacks against each other, leading them to mutually annihilate themselves. The one responsible for pulling out Rui's NOTE as well as Rizumu's NOTE from ''Insight'', allowing them to manifest CROWDS and empower ordinary people. Katze uses Internet slang to speak, relishes [[schadenfreude]] and possesses the power to turn invisible. It is implied the alien may have been a Gatchaman that went rogue, indicated by Katze possessing a gold-coloured {{nihongo|Schadenfreude NOTE|幸災楽禍のNOTE|Kōsairakuka no Nōto}} that can transform the alien into a more powerful form like the others. Katze later steals Rui's appearance to take control of X, and by extension GALAX, in order to spread chaos by giving all the people previously placed on a blacklist access to the CROWDS, inciting them to attack governmental buildings to capture the prime minister Sugayama, and then moving on to allowing everyone access to the CROWDS after assuming Sugayama's appearance during a public message. In the end, O.D challenges the alien to a fight that Katze ends up losing due to the greater strength of O.D's powers and is left in a weakened state for a while, during which O.D, who was also badly injured, manages to take back Rui's NOTE and return it to Rui. This leads to restoring calm to the city following Rui's strategic plan of introducing online games to the CROWDS users that focus on helping people by the time Katze recovers. Unable to stir up any further conflict after waking up, Katze seemingly gives up for the moment and disappears, dissatisfied.

:By the end of the first season, however, Katze is inexplicably shown talking from within Hajime while complaining about the situation. It is later revealed in the director's cut that Hajime absorbed Katze into her own body to contain the alien. Despite being unable to cause trouble anymore, Katze usually still manifests in some way, speaking from within her. Katze's NOTE is golden in color with a unique symbol that reverts to the Gatchaman's original logo after Hajime fuses it into her own body, suggesting she has become its possessor. While transformed, the alien can turn invisible and remain unaffected by any attacks while delivering powerful attacks with either a guitar-like instrument or with the diamond-patterned chains covering Katze's form.

:In ''Insight'', Katze is said to have known Gelsadra, and ran away from him in fear.

;{{nihongo|Rizumu Suzuki|鈴木 理詰夢|Suzuki Rizumu}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yuichiro Umehara]]|Patrick Poole}}
:A 21-year-old medical student at the [[University of Tokyo]] who opposes the CROWDS system, claiming that mankind is not capable of properly making use of it. He is the ringleader of the mysterious terrorist organization &quot;VAPE&quot; (short for &quot;Violent Apes&quot;), composed of individuals using red-colored CROWDS. He also possesses a magenta-colored NOTE that he obtained from Berg Katze just like Rui did, but refrained from using it until the CROWDS system was established, after which he decided to use it in order to bring it down. At first he attempts to assassinate the prime minister Sugayama with the CROWDS while he is on board an airplane but is thwarted by the arrival of the Gatchaman team. Afterward, he attacks the citizens of Shibuya and spreads terror with the help of his CROWDS and compels Rui to surrender his NOTE to him or else he will harm the innocent people being held hostage. Once Rui gives him his NOTE, he proceeds to stab it with his dagger multiple times and nearly kills Rui from the ensuing damage (due to the NOTE being akin to a physical manifestation of the person's soul) until Tsubasa and Gelsadra rush to Rui's rescue, at which point Rizumu quickly surrenders and is apprehended.

:After the Kuu-samas came to existence, he gets a call of help from President X, informing him that Rui has fallen victim to them and has become completely mindless and unmotivated. He easily breaks out of jail thanks to a warden who is also a member of VAPE, and has his organisation manipulate the social media to blame Gelsadra for the Kuu-samas' drastic acts of consuming people, while expressing his disappointment to Rui, waking him up. Witnessing the Gatchaman's solution to the problem has the public now properly thinking for themselves, he feels satisfied as he takes his leave.

;{{nihongo|Kuu-sama|くうさま|Kuusama}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yurika Kubo]], [[Marie Miyake]]|[[Tiffany Grant]]}}
:Mysterious creatures that emerge from red speech balloons that are created when speech balloons leaked from Gelsadra fused with the public's unabsorbed speech balloons. They appear to be friendly, gentle beings that soothe people on an emotional level. They heavily rely on reading the atmosphere to determine their actions, mainly emphatising on the goal of everybody becoming one. They will, however, attack people who defy this belief, sapping away their individual will and eventually causing them to succumb to forever staying their comforts through hugs, or in the case of worse people, swallowing them up whole. It is impled that they are Gelsadra's new ability as a result of being influenced by Tsubasa, however because they act solely on what they think the people want, he has no control over them, eventually being targetted for elimination himself when Rizumu's manipulation of the social media turns the public against him. The Gatchaman attempted to fight them, but seeing that their numbers will not go down so long as the public's desire for Gelsadra's execution remains, Hajime devises a plan to give them what they want, broadcasting a live execution of Gelsadra(actually herself) by the Gatchaman. This made the public realize how horrible they have become, killing off the mood and most of the Kuu-samas as a result. A month later the remaining small population of Kuu-samas are shown to be getting along with the reinstated CROWDS.

;{{nihongo|President X|総裁X|Sōsai Ekkusu}}
:{{voiced by|[[Sakura Tange]]|Jenni Strader}}
:X is an artificial intelligence created by Rui to oversee GALAX and perform [[data mining]] on all information gathered from its users globally to assist with his plans to update the world. It is an interactive AI that can readily communicate with all its users. It often provides helpful information, resources or even directly contacts nearby GALAX users to resolve problems. Rui sees it as his friend and the only one he can actually trust. X seems to harbour similar feelings for Rui. When Berg Katze takes advantage of this by hijacking it by stealing Rui's form, X is shown to be surprised and upset at &quot;Rui&quot;'s change and sudden misdeeds. It reunites with Rui again though, after Rui tells it he saw the same sunset as X did before and thought the sky looked beautiful in contrast to the dismissive reply the fake Rui gave it. After Rui becomes an official Gatchaman, X is shown to connect with his transformed form where it provides him with constant support through the display screen on his chest, and is represented by the large X-shaped disc attached to his back. In ''Insight'' it has become involved in politics by allowing users to vote on who they want as mayor and even prime minister through their smart phones on GALAX, as well as allow the public to express their approval or disapproval in the current prime minister's actions with a new voting system.

:Just like Katze, X is named after Sōsai X, the main villain from the [[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman|original series]] and the primary antagonist.

;{{nihongo|Gelsadra|ゲルサドラ|Gerusadora}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]] (Child), [[Tomokazu Sugita]] (Adult)|Bryson Baugus (Child), [[Chris Patton]] (Adult)}}
:An alien who makes an emergency landing in a spaceship in front of Tsubasa's house, and becomes attached to her. Gelsadra has the power to materialize [[speech balloon]]s over people's heads, that change according to their state of mind, with a few unusual exceptions, including Hajime and Yu whose balloons remain consistently grey. He regularly absorbs all the balloons around him in order to gain an understanding of the current situation, and then respond appropriately to improve the atmosphere and achieve a sense of unity. He is known for bringing peace to several planets using his powers and is placed under the protection of the G-Crew. He is named after a character from ''[[Gatchaman II]]''.

:After Rizumu terrorizes the people of Shibuya with his red CROWDS and harms Rui in the process, Gelsadra realizes the public wants a hero and assists Tsubasa in rescuing Rui to answer their wish. Later on, upon learning of the power and influence that a prime minister possesses, and particularly after Sugayama steps down in order to start another election that is open to anyone to enter, Gelsadra enters the political race with the goal of abolishing the CROWDS after reading the general atmosphere and deciding that people no longer want it. He also ages himself up from the youthful appearance of a child into an adult to instill confidence in the people voting for him. With Joe's help as well as a string of gaffes committed by Sugayama becoming viral, he easily wins the election and then passes a series of revolutionary political and social reforms to please the masses, starting with removing the entire cabinet, to lowering taxes and vastly improving social services.

:However, Gelsadra eventually bloats up from the overabsorption of speech balloons, resulting in him being unable to absorb any more, much to his dismay, as well as his body expelling some of the speech bubbles. These speech bubbles would end up fusing with the public's unabsorbed speech bubbles  to produce red-white-blue coloured creatures that Gelsadra eventually names &quot;Kuu-sama&quot;. After Rizumu's manipulation of the social media turns the Kuu-samas against him, Hajime rescues him, and tells him to start thinking for himself instead of always relying on the public's opinion. Wishing to stay on Earth so he can be with Tsubasa, he releases all the speech balloons he had absorbed and returns to his child form. After Hajime's sacrifice with a month-long election for the public to rethink and decide his fate, he was allowed to stay on Earth.

;{{nihongo|Millio Toriyama|鳥山 ミリオ|Toriyama Mirio}}
:{{voiced by|[[Junichi Suwabe]]}}
:A popular host of the day show &quot;Millione Shop&quot; along with O.D. Millio is showy and speaks frankly.

;{{nihongo|Yū Misudachi|三栖立 悠|Misudachi Yū}}
:{{voiced by|[[Shiro Saito]]}}
:Tsubasa's 99-year-old great-grandfather and a legendary veteran pyrotechnician. Everyone calls him &quot;Yurujī&quot;. He's a bit stubborn and also lively for his age, claiming that Tsubasa is still too inexperienced to take part in his business.

==Description==
Picking up immediately where ''Gatchaman II'' left off in storyline, the third and final series debuted a week later, running for 48 episodes. Aspects such as the animation, music, and mecha designs were further overhauled with ''F''.

==Plot and character summary==
After Leader X is seemingly destroyed for good at the end of ''Gatchaman II'', a fragment of him that survived grows and mutates into Z. With the head of the Egobossler family, Count Egobossler (and his two subordinates '''Mechandol''' and '''Kempler'''), Z is bent on destroying the Earth, and the Science Ninja Team, once more.

In the wake of Anderson's death, Dr.Nambu has become the new head of the ISO, while the team is now confined to the '''Gallatown''' (aka &quot;G-Town&quot;) underwater base. '''Engineer Kamo''' is introduced, and after the '''New GodPhoenix''' is destroyed early on, the team receives the new '''Gatchaspartan''' as their mecha. The Gatchaspartan has a special mode as well, called '''Hypershoot''', that can only be utilized by Ken (with his new &quot;Gatchafencer&quot; sword).

As the series progresses, it is learned that the radiation exposure from constant use of the Hypershoot is slowly killing Ken, and that continued use would mean death. Meanwhile, Z plans to destroy the earth with an antimatter asteroid, codenamed &quot;Poison Apple&quot;.

The final eight episodes of the series took a darker turn, with more death and destruction involved. These episodes were not included in the [[Eagle Riders]] adaptation, though a segment of #47 was inserted into one of the other episodes, and the opening sequence shows clips from the final scene of #48.

The mecha in this series became more like the standard anime mecha seen in other series around the time, rather than the 'bird' theme in ''Gatchaman II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/gatchaman_f/digest.html |title=科学忍者隊ガッチャマンF ダイジェスト |accessdate=2008-07-21 |work=[[Tatsunoko Production]] |publisher= |date= |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420102621/http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/gatchaman_f/digest.html |archivedate=2008-04-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/gatchaman_f/chara.html |title=科学忍者隊ガッチャマンF キャラクター |accessdate=2008-07-21 |work=[[Tatsunoko Production]] |publisher= |date= |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424145855/http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/gatchaman_f/chara.html |archivedate=2008-04-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and changes==
18 episodes of ''F'' were utilized for [[Eagle Riders]], and went through the same edit procedures that episodes of ''II'' had gone through, though [[Saban Entertainment]] also began merging some episodes together, and adding scenes from otherwise-untranslated episodes in new context into others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ex.org/1.1/12-riap_1.html  |title=RIAP Writes|accessdate=2016-04-21 |work=EX |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2015/01/17/gatchaman-complete-collection-bluray-review/|title='Gatchaman Complete Collection' BluRay Review|first=Ollie|last=Barder|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Count Egobossler's name was changed to '''Happy Boy''' (for the grin-faced mask and his laughing) in the dub, and his origin was also rewritten. Originally, Egobossler was the son of the original Count, but killed his father (after he witnessed his mother being murdered by him) and imprisoned his brother, becoming the new Count in the process. In ''Eagle Riders'', Happy Boy was instead the new form of '''Mallanox''' (the ''Gatchaman II'' villainess '''Gel Sadra'''), transformed by Cybercon in a new attempt to defeat the Eagle Riders.

Ken's deterioration was also toned down in the dub, with a few select episodes dealing with the plot point translated. In ''Eagle Riders'', '''Hunter''' is cured of the illness before the end of the series, while in ''F'', the supposed cure was not effective for long, and Ken's condition worsened.

The final eight episodes, which dealt with the death of Nambu, Ken on the verge of dying from use of the Hypershoot, Z's &quot;Poison Apple&quot; plan, and the team's final confrontation against Z, were not included. Instead, episode 15 (''Hell's Burning Ambition'') was used as the series finale.

== Plot ==
Two years after the defeat of Galactor and the apparent death of Condor Joe, a cruise ship is attacked by Leader X, killing nearly everyone on board. One of the survivors, a young girl, is captured by X and rapidly aged into the bizarre, masculine-voiced villainess '''Gel Sadra'''. Though she has the appearance of an adult, Gel Sadra is not immune to throwing childish tantrums and behaving immaturely.

In the midst of the revival of Galactor, the Science Ninja Team is called back into action, with a shady man known as '''Hawk Getz''' acting as the replacement for Joe. Getz is quickly revealed to be a Galactor agent in disguise (and had killed the actual Getz who was to join), and winds up killed by a mysterious feather shuriken. After hints spread in the first three episodes, Joe reappears in the fourth episode, having somehow survived his fatal injuries at the end of the first series, and rejoins the team. It is later revealed that he was rescued by an ex-Galactor scientist at the brink of his death, and was the subject of various cybernetic augmentations.

Later in the series, a female scientist known as '''Dr. Pandora''' is introduced, who had lost her husband and daughter in the cruise ship disaster. Unbeknown to her, her daughter Sammie survived and is in fact Gel Sadra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/gatchaman_2/digest.html |title=Tatsunoko Pro |accessdate=2008-07-20 |work=[[Tatsunoko Production]] |publisher= |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423224203/http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/gatchaman_2/digest.html |archivedate=2008-04-23 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new series, the characters were given new mecha and weapons, the space-worthy '''New GodPhoenix''' and individual mecha all given a noticeable bird motif. The New GodPhoenix is larger than the original, and equipped with &quot;Pima&quot; a robot pilot. There were also minor design changes to some characters, to go along with the new animation style (Jun's hair became shorter and straighter, in one example). The characters also advanced two years in age, Jinpei now approximately thirteen years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/english/box05.html#4  |title=Tatsunoko Pro|accessdate=2008-07-14 |work=[[Tatsunoko Production]] |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tatsunokousa.com/gatchaman2.html  |title=Science Ninja Gatchaman II|accessdate=2008-07-14 |work=Tatsunoko Production USA |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Following the first feature film of the original ''Gatchaman'' in 1978, and a radio show of the series which previewed some of the new installments, the sequel series was released on October 1, the same date as the original series broadcast in 1972. It ran for 52 episodes, and was immediately followed up by the third and final series, ''[[Gatchaman Fighter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2015/01/17/gatchaman-complete-collection-bluray-review/|title='Gatchaman Complete Collection' BluRay Review|first=Ollie|last=Barder|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though neither of the sequels were licensed and adapted by Sandy Frank, some ''Gatchaman II'' merchandise was sold under the [[Battle of the Planets]] name, most notably the '''New GodPhoenix''' model, causing confusion for those who had seen the English adaptation.

=== Adaptations and changes ===
In 1996, Gatchaman II was licensed by [[Saban Entertainment]] and combined with the third series, ''Gatchaman F'' (Fighter), to create [[Eagle Riders]]. 47 of the 52 episodes of the series were translated in the adaptation, though heavily edited to remove violence and other elements found objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ex.org/1.1/12-riap_1.html  |title=RIAP Writes|accessdate=2016-04-21 |work=EX |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes 6, 16-17, 28, and 35 were not used in the translation, and episode 21 (''Youth's Broken Wings'') was moved and aired in place of the original episode 6 (''Attack Of The Pyramid Power'').

Elements removed from the series included the ''Queen Margaret'' cruise ship disaster in the first episode, along with the transformation of Sammie Pandora into Gel Sadra (called '''Mallanox''' in the dub and initially stated as being male). Scenes depicting destruction in cities were also edited to remove references to death, and the Galactor soldiers (now christened '''Vorak''') were said to be androids and would be &quot;deactivated&quot; instead of having been killed. Character names were Westernized in the dub, as well as the entire soundtrack being changed.

To segue the two series together, Gel Sadra's death at the end of ''Gatchaman II'' was edited and rewritten so that instead of dying, &quot;Mallanox&quot; is instead transformed further by Cybercon (Leader X) into a new form called '''Happy Boy''' (originally '''Count Egobossler''', the nemesis in ''F'').

Eagle Riders only had 13 episodes broadcast in the US, as the translation and editing were reviled by fans of Gatchaman, and the Saban adaptation was pulled from airwaves soon afterwards, not having been seen since.

[[Eagle Riders]], as with all Saban productions, is currently owned by Disney. 

On December 20, 2016, [[Sentai Filmworks]] announced their license for the series and will release an uncut, subtitled DVD set on April 18, 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sentai&quot; /&gt;

'''Gavin Grant''' (born 27 March 1984) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]]. He was convicted in July 2010 of a murder committed in 2004.&lt;ref name=Sentence&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-10760139 |title=Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant jailed for murder |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Grant started his career at non-League [[Tooting &amp; Mitcham United F.C.|Tooting &amp; Mitcham]], before being signed by [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. He later joined [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].

He was then loaned out to [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] at the end of the 2006–07 season, scoring four times in 10 appearances in all competitions. During this time, he was under investigation for a killing related to the murder of which he was subsequently convicted, and the loan deal was cut short due to Grant breaking his curfew and being arrested again. He was later acquitted on those charges.

Grant secured another loan deal, this time season-long to Grays on 24 August 2007, however it was cut short and he returned to the Lions in January 2008. He then joined [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]] on loan in February 2008.

Grant was released by Millwall at the end of the 2007–08 season, and was signed by new [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] boss [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] on a two-year contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wigan sign Palace defender Boyce&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Conviction==
Grant was accused of killing Jahmall Moore in 2005, but was cleared of murder in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant guilty of murder &quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-10744897 |title=Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant guilty of murder |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=23 July 2010 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 23 July 2010, Grant was found guilty, along with Gareth Downie, of killing 21-year-old Leon Labastide in May 2004. The courts heard that both incidents were part of &quot;tit-for-tat&quot; shootings in the Stonebridge Park estate in [[Harlesden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Footballer gunned down rival&quot;&gt;{{cite news

He received a [[life sentence]], subject to a [[Life imprisonment (England and Wales)#Minimum term|minimum]] of 25 years in prison.&lt;ref name=Sentence/&gt;

On 31 October 2014, Grant was given right to appeal to conviction after three senior judges at the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] had concerns over the 2010 trial as police failed to disclose important details about one of key prosecution witnesses which may have affected the jury's decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Former Milwall footballer wins right to appeal Stonebridge murder conviction&quot;&gt;{{cite news

'''Gavin Sullivan''' is a character from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Paul Nicholas]]. He first appears in the 5,124th episode of the show, originally broadcast in the United Kingdom on 21 August 2015. Gavin is the husband of [[Kathy Sullivan (EastEnders)|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and is also revealed as the biological father of [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). He is first mentioned as Sharon's father in 1990 and as Kathy's husband after Kathy's departure in 2000, but does not appear on screen until 2015 and it is not known that Sharon's father and Kathy's husband are the same person until October 2015. Viewers are informed in a 2006 episode that Kathy and Gavin are dead, but Kathy returns in February 2015, revealing that Gavin is also alive. Billed as &quot;an ''EastEnders'' villain like no other&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;villain like no other&quot;/&gt; Gavin has been described as &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;sinister&quot;, &quot;nasty&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. His storylines include his &quot;abusive&quot;, &quot;controlling&quot; and &quot;manipulative&quot; relationship with Kathy, kidnapping recovering alcoholic [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and getting him drinking again, and blackmailing [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]). His departure involves kidnapping Kathy, causing the death of his sister [[Margaret Midhurst]] ([[Jan Harvey]]) and being arrested after threatening to kill himself and Sharon. He appears in 30 episodes, and his final appearance is in the 5,312th episode of ''EastEnders'', broadcast on 8 July 2016.

==Storylines==
Having faked her own death, Gavin's wife, [[Kathy Sullivan (EastEnders)|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), makes plans to escape Gavin and asks [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) for money on several occasions, saying she is willing to go to prison so she can eventually reunite with her family in [[Walford]]. Kathy and Phil arrange to meet at St Pancras International, but she cannot meet him because her son, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), is there. As she leaves, Gavin surprises her, revealing he knows what she has planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;21aug15&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 21/08/2015 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0670l9b |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Toby Frow; Writer: [[Rob Gittins]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Kathy makes attempts to contact someone at [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, Gavin arrives on [[Albert Square]].&lt;ref name=&quot;10sep15&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 10/09/2015 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06b80b8 |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Nic Phillips; Writer: Gillian Richmond |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He texts Phil, pretending to be Kathy, and meets him, revealing that after St Pancras, he and Kathy planned to fly themselves to Spain but Kathy escaped by crashing the car. Phil discovers that Kathy is staying in a guest house in Kent, but Gavin follows Phil there and finds Kathy first.

Phil has a panic button installed and Kathy helps the police trace Gavin via his mobile phone. Ben tells Gavin to leave or be arrested, as the police have arrived. Ben tells his family that Gavin has left, but Gavin returns, where [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) apparently recognises him and appears fearful.&lt;ref name=&quot;29oct15&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 29/10/2015 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06mzlp5 |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Toby Frow; Writer: Julia Honour |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Halloween, Kathy is on edge, and she fears Gavin has gone into Ian's house. Ben and Kathy then see Gavin, but are unsure it was him. They go to Phil's house, where Gavin locks Phil and [[Dennis Rickman Jnr]] (Bleu Landau) in a bedroom. When Kathy attempts to call the police, Gavin appears. He threatens to light fireworks inside the house, hoping to kill himself, Kathy, Ben, Phil and Dennis. [[Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), Phil's wife and Dennis's mother, arrives and Gavin reveals he knows that Sharon is the adopted daughter of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]). Gavin surprises Kathy by saying that Walford was once his home and he had a child. Sharon realises Gavin could be her birth father, and he confirms it when he says, &quot;Hello, princess&quot;, which Den used to say to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;30oct15&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 30/10/2015 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06mzqmp |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Executive Producer: [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]; Director: Toby Frow; Writer: Leo Richardson |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathy pleads with Gavin not to light the fireworks and promises to leave with him again. Phil escapes, knocks Gavin unconscious and ties him up. While Sharon talks to Kathy, she realises that [[Margaret Midhurst]] ([[Jan Harvey]]), the solicitor who arranged her adoption and who she has been visiting to track her father, is Gavin's sister. When Gavin wakes up, Sharon asks about her adoption; Gavin says he had a fling with [[Carol Hanley]] ([[Sheila White (actress)|Sheila White]]), who had a breakdown after Sharon's birth, and Gavin was not paternal but Den was, so he traded Sharon for part in a bank raid that Den was working on. Phil then tells Sharon that Gavin previously had him locked in a room with no windows and just a bottle of whisky, meaning Phil turned to alcohol. Sharon decides to call the police so presses Phil's panic button.

==Development==
===Introduction===
After it was confirmed that Taylforth was returning to ''EastEnders'', executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: &quot;It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns. We know that there was a man named Gavin, who Kathy went off with to South Africa. So there's Gavin, Kathy—and lots of [[Phil Mitchell|Phil [Mitchell]]] involved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2–8 May 2015|title=Kathy: The Countdown Begins!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|volume=2015|issue=17|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption &quot;He's on his way...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS 20150618&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/dominictc/status/611204919945744384|title=DomTreadwellCollins on Twitter: &quot;He's on his way... #EastEnders #KathysBack #Gavin|last=Treadwell-Collins|first=Dominic|authorlink=Dominic Treadwell-Collins|date=17 June 2015|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it was confirmed that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline.

I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DS 20150618&quot; /&gt; Executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] said: &quot;We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed to join our cast to play Gavin.

===Paternity of Sharon Watts===
Several news outlets reported speculation that Gavin could be the birth father of [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). Treadwell-Collins' comment that the character would &quot;have a little foot in the past and a foot in the present&quot; and is &quot;holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets&quot; caused David Brown, writer for ''[[Radio Times]]'', to wonder what Gavin's connection to the past would be, saying &quot;it's surely no coincidence that Sharon has recently been searching for her birth dad—a man who we know to also be called Gavin.&quot; Brown said it would &quot;make for some intriguing family dynamics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RT 20150727&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-06-27/paul-nicholas-plays-an-eastenders-villain-like-no-other-says-show-boss---but-will-he-be-sharons-dad-as-well-as-kathys-husband|title=Paul Nicholas plays an EastEnders villain like no other, says show boss - but will he be Sharon's dad as well as Kathy's husband?|last=Brown|first=David|date=27 June 2015|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inside Soap'' said that they had a hunch that Kathy's husband Gavin and Sharon's father Gavin could be the same person, making Sharon Kathy's stepdaughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;IS 2015 25 p15&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=27 June – 3 July 2015|title=Hello, (step)mum!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|volume=2015|issue=25|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''All About Soap'' said it &quot;cannot be a coincidence&quot; that Sharon's real father has the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAS 352&quot;/&gt;

Speculation increased when on-location photos emerged, showing Kathy with police outside a house, which looks similar to scenes already shown of Sharon visiting the street where her father lives, and both scenes took place in Notting Hill.

After the reveal that Gavin is Sharon's father, ''[[Inside Soap]]'' said, &quot;Gavin cemented himself as Walford's Most Wicked when he subjected the Mitchells to the Halloween from hell.

Den is still remembered and people still ask me to say, 'Ello princess', because it was one of those bits that made him so popular! You do feel like you own it when you've made such an impact.

In February 2016, Laura-Jane Tyler from ''Inside Soap'' said, &quot;We're in awe of Gavin's ability to glide in and out of Walford houses undetected, as if he's wearing a magical raincoat of invisibilty.

==Early life==
[[File:Gavrilo Princip's parents.jpg|thumb|left|Gavrilo Princip's parents, Marija and Petar]]
Gavrilo Princip was born in the remote hamlet of [[Obljaj]], near [[Bosansko Grahovo]], on {{OldStyleDate|25 July|1894|13 July}}. He was the second of his parents' nine children, six of whom died in infancy. Princip's mother Marija wanted to name him after her late brother Špiro, but he was named Gavrilo at the insistence of a local [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] priest, who claimed that naming the sickly infant after the Archangel [[Gabriel]] would help him survive.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=187–188}}

A [[Serb]] family, the Princips had lived in northwestern Bosnia for many centuries{{sfn|Fromkin|2007|pp=121–122}} and adhered to the Serbian Orthodox Christian faith.{{sfn|Roider|2005|p=935}} Princip's parents, Petar and Marija (''née'' Mićić), were poor farmers who lived off the little land that they owned.{{sfn|Fabijančić|2010|p=xxii}} They belonged to a class of Christian peasants known as ''kmet''s ([[serfs]]), who were often oppressed by their Muslim landlords.{{sfn|Schlesser|2005|p=93}} Petar, who insisted on &quot;strict correctness&quot;, never drank or swore and was ridiculed by his neighbours as a result.{{sfn|Fabijančić|2010|p=xxii}} In his youth, he fought in the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77)|Herzegovina Uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Kidner|Bucur|Mathisen|McKee|2013|p=756}} Following the revolt, he returned to being a farmer in the Grahovo valley, where he worked approximately {{convert|4|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} of land and was forced to give one-third of his income away to his landlord. As he could not grow enough grain to feed his family, he resorted to transporting mail and passengers across the mountains separating northwestern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] from [[Dalmatia]] in order to supplement his income.{{sfn|Schlesser|2005|p=95}}

Despite his father's opposition, Princip first began attending primary school in 1903, aged nine. He overcame a difficult first year and became very successful in his studies, for which he was awarded a collection of Serbian epic poetry by his headmaster.{{sfn|Kidner|Bucur|Mathisen|McKee|2013|p=756}} At the age of 13, Princip moved to [[Sarajevo]], where his older brother Jovan intended to enroll him into an Austro-Hungarian military school.{{sfn|Kidner|Bucur|Mathisen|McKee|2013|p=756}} By the time Princip reached Sarajevo, Jovan had changed his mind after a friend advised him not to make Gavrilo &quot;an executioner of his own people&quot;. Princip was enrolled into a merchant school instead.{{sfn|Roider|2005|p=936}} Jovan paid for his tuition with the money he had earned performing manual labour, carrying logs from the forests surrounding Sarajevo to mills within the city.{{sfn|Schlesser|2005|p=96}} After three years of study, Gavrilo transferred to a local [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. {{sfn|Roider|2005|p=936}} In 1910, he came to revere [[Bogdan Žerajić]], a [[Bosnian Serb]] revolutionary who attempted to assassinate [[Marijan Varešanin]], the Austro-Hungarian [[Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], before taking his own life.{{sfn|Schlesser|2005|p=96}} In 1911, Princip joined [[Young Bosnia]] ({{lang-sr|''Mlada Bosna''}}), a society that wanted to separate Bosnia from Austria-Hungary and unite it with the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Serbia]].{{sfn|Roider|2005|p=936}} Because the local authorities had forbidden students from forming organizations and clubs, Princip and other members of Young Bosnia met in secret. During their meetings, they discussed [[literature]], [[ethics]] and [[politics]].{{sfn|Schlesser|2005|p=96}}

[[File:Princip &amp; Grabich &amp; Chabrinovich.jpg|thumb|left|[[Trifko Grabež]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]] and Princip in [[Kalemegdan]], Belgrade, May 1914.]]
In 1912, Princip was expelled from school for being involved in a demonstration against Austro-Hungarian authorities.{{sfn|Kidner|Bucur|Mathisen|McKee|2013|p=756}} A student who witnessed the incident claimed that &quot;Princip went from class to class, threatening with his [[brass knuckles|knuckle-duster]] all the boys who wavered in coming to the new demonstrations.&quot;{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=154}} Princip left Sarajevo shortly after being expelled and made the {{convert|280|km}} journey to [[Belgrade]] on foot. According to one account, he fell to his knees and kissed the ground upon crossing the border into Serbia. In Belgrade, Princip volunteered to join the Serbian guerrilla bands fighting the Ottoman Turks, under the leadership of Major [[Vojislav Tankosić]].{{sfn|Schlesser|2005|p=97}} Tankosić was a member of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], the foremost conspiratorial society in Serbia at the time.{{sfn|Roider|2005|p=936}}

At first, Princip was rejected at a recruitment office in Belgrade because of his small stature. Enraged, he tracked down Tankosić himself, who also told him that he was too small and weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;glenny&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJqYbknmxjYC&amp;pg=PT210&amp;lpg=PT210&amp;dq=gavrilo+princip+rejected+at+recruitment+office+in+belgrade&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KJWqtvPmq5&amp;sig=3HoSn4fV5pML_mcwf9TKHEim-cE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjoIjGvJLRAhVs04MKHRUIAC0Q6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=gavrilo%20princip%20rejected%20at%20recruitment%20office%20in%20belgrade&amp;f=false |title=The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804–2012: New and Updated |author=Misha Glenny |chapter=4 |date=5 September 2012 |publisher=House of Anansi |edition=revised |isbn=978-1-77089-274-3 |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humiliated, Princip returned to Bosnia and lodged with his brother in Sarajevo. He spent the next several months moving back and forth between Sarajevo and Belgrade. In Belgrade he met Živojin Rafajlović, one of the founders of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]], who sent him (alongside 15 other Young Bosnia members) to the Chetnik training centre in [[Vranje]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Documentary History of the War |volume=2 |year=1917 |publisher=Printing House Square |location=London

He lived in Cupara's house, which is today located on Gavrilo Princip Street in Vranje. Princip practiced shooting, using bombs and the blade, after which training was completed and he returned to Belgrade.&lt;ref name=blic&gt;{{cite news|last=Irić|first=Radoman|title=''Ovde je Gavrilo Princip učio da puca ''|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Reportaza/408974/Ovde-je-Gavrilo-Princip-ucio-da-puca|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=[[Blic]]|date=2 October 2013|location=Belgrade|page=21|language=Serbian|trans-title= This is where Gavrilo Princip learnt to shoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, while Princip was staying in Sarajevo, Austria-Hungary declared a [[state of emergency]], implemented [[martial law]], seized control of all schools and prohibited all Serb cultural organizations.{{sfn|Schlesser|2005|p=97}}

On 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip participated in the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke]] Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Duchess Sophie Chotek of Austria. The emperor of Austria-Hungary, [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] told his nephew, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the Archduke]] to oversee military training in Bosnia. Franz Ferdinand knew that the visit would be dangerous; his uncle, [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]], had been the subject of an assassination attempt by the Black Hand in 1911.&lt;ref name=SJ&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokesbury|first=James|title=A Short History of World War I|year=1981|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|pages=60–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Sunday, the royal couple arrived in [[Sarajevo]] by train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burns|first1=Tracy|title='June 28, 1914: The first attempt'|url=https://www.private-prague-guide.com/article/archduke-franz-ferdinand-of-austria-and-his-assassination-june-28-1914/|website=www.private-prague-guide.com/|quote=&quot;On June 28, 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand 'Este and his wife Duchess of Hohenberg arrived in Sarajevo by train shortly before 10 am&quot;|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal couple were then to take an automobile into the city. In the front car was [[Fehim Čurčić]], the mayor of Sarajevo and Dr. Edmund Gerde, the city's [[Commissioner of Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Christopher|title=First Shot of World War I|url=http://www.historynet.com/first-shot-of-world-war-i.htm|website=www.historynet.com/|quote=&quot;On the morning of Sunday, June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir apparent to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie Chotek von Chotkowa und Wognin, arrived by train in the city of Sarajevo and boarded a motorcar for the ride down the Appel Quay to the City Hall. There were six vehicles in the motorcade. In the lead car was a security detail. In the second car were the mayor of Sarajevo, Fehim Effendi Curcic, dressed in a fez and a dark suit, and the Sarajevo police commissioner, Dr. Edmund Gerdemotor.&quot;|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franz Ferdinand and Sophie were in the second car with [[Oskar Potiorek]] and Lieutenant Colonel Count Franz von Harrach.&lt;ref name=Donnelley33&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donnelley|first1=Paul|title=Assassination!|date=2012|isbn=978-1-908963-03-1|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLCXAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA33|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car's top was rolled back in order to allow the crowds a good view of its occupants.&lt;ref name=Donnelley33/&gt;

The six conspirators lined the route. They were spaced out along the Appel Quay, each one with instructions to try to kill Franz Ferdinand when the royal car reached his position. The first conspirator on the route to see the royal car was [[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]]. Standing by the Austro-Hungarian Bank, Mehmedbašić lost his nerve and allowed the car to pass without taking action. Mehmedbašić later said that a policeman was standing behind him and feared he would be arrested before he had a chance to throw his bomb.&lt;ref name=SJ /&gt; At 10:15, when the six-car procession passed the central police station, nineteen-year-old student [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]] hurled a [[hand grenade]] at the Archduke's car. The driver accelerated when he saw the object flying towards him, but the bomb had a 10-second delay and exploded under the wheel of the fourth car. Two of the occupants, Eric von Merizzi and Count Alexander von Boos-Waldeck, were seriously wounded. About a dozen spectators were also hit by bomb shrapnel.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|loc=ch. XIV, footnote 21}} After Čabrinović's bomb missed the car, five other conspirators, including Princip, lost an opportunity to attack because of the heavy crowds and the car's high speed. To avoid capture, Čabrinović swallowed a [[cyanide]] capsule and jumped into the [[Miljacka]] river to make sure he died. However, the cyanide pill was expired and only made him sick, and the river was only {{convert|10|cm|in|0}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;Malmberg, Ilkka: ''Tästä alkaa maailmansota''. [This is the beginning of World War I] ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' monthly supplement, June 2014, pp. 60–65.&lt;/ref&gt; A few seconds later he was hauled out and detained by police.

Franz Ferdinand later decided to go to the hospital and visit the victims of Čabrinović's grenade attack. In order to avoid the city centre, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, Potiorek forgot to inform the driver, [[Leopold Loyka]], about this decision. On the way to the hospital, Loyka took a right turn into Franz Josef Street.  Princip was standing near Moritz Schiller's café when he spotted the car as it drove past, having taken the wrong turn. After realizing the mistake, the driver put his foot on the brake, and began to reverse. In doing so the engine stalled and the gears locked, giving Princip his opportunity. Princip stepped forward, drew his pistol, an [[FN Model 1910]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belfield|first=Richard|title=A Brief History of Hitmen and Assassinations|year=2011|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson, Ltd.|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at a distance of about {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} fired twice into the car, first hitting Franz Ferdinand in the neck, and then hitting his wife Sophie in the [[abdomen]], after she instinctively covered his body. They both died before 11:00 am.

==Imprisonment and death==

Princip attempted suicide with a cyanide pill, but it was out-of-date (as did Čabrinović, leading the police to believe the group had been deceived buying the poison), then tried to shoot himself, but the pistol was wrestled from his hand before he had a chance to fire another shot.  Princip was nineteen years old at the time and too young to receive the death penalty, being only twenty-seven days short of the twenty-year minimum age limit required by Habsburg law.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-one/10273752/gavrilo-princip.html |title=The man who started the First World War |publisher=Daily Telegraph |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he received the maximum sentence of twenty years in prison. He was held in harsh conditions which were worsened by the war, and contracted [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson&quot;/&gt; He died on 28 April 1918 at [[Terezín]] 3 years and 10 months after the assassination. At the time of his death, weakened by malnutrition and disease, he weighed around {{convert|40|kg|lb stlb}}. His body had become wracked by [[Pott disease|skeletal tuberculosis]] that ate away his bones so badly that his right arm had to be amputated.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt;

Fearing his bones might become relics for Slavic nationalists, Princip's prison guards secretly took the body to an unmarked grave, but a Czech soldier assigned to the burial remembered the location, and in 1920 Princip and the other &quot;Heroes of Vidovdan&quot; were exhumed and brought to Sarajevo, where they were buried together beneath a chapel &quot;built to commemorate for eternity our Serb Heroes&quot; at St. Mark's Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=6758252 |title=Gavrilo Princip |date=6 September 2002 |website=findagrave.com |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226183847/http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=6758252 |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapon==
[[File:FN Model 1910 IMG 3065.jpg|thumb|An FN M1910 pistol, the same as the one used by Gavrilo Princip to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]

Princip's pistol was confiscated by the authorities and eventually given, along with the Archduke's bloody undershirt, to [[:de:Anton Puntigam|Anton Puntigam]], a Jesuit priest who was a close friend of the Archduke and had given the Archduke and his wife the last rites. The pistol and shirt remained in the possession of the Austrian Jesuits until they were offered on long-term loan to the [[Museum of Military History, Vienna|Museum of Military History]] in Vienna in 2004. It is now part of the permanent exhibition there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly |first=Kate |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/1465206/Found-the-gun-that-shook-the-world.html |title=Found: the gun that shook the world|newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=22 June 2004 |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weapon is a [[.380 ACP|9-mm &quot;9 short&quot;, .380 ACP]] pistol [[FN Model 1910|FN Browning Model 1910]] made in Belgium by [[Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal]] with the serial number 19074.&lt;ref name=&quot;RauchensteinerLitscher&quot;&gt;Manfried Rauchensteiner, Manfred Litscher (ed.): ''Das Heeresgeschichtliche Museum in Wien.''

==Legacy==
The house where Gavrilo Princip lived in Sarajevo was destroyed during World War I. After the war, it was rebuilt as a museum in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Yugoslavia was conquered by Germany in 1941 and Sarajevo became part of the Independent State of Croatia. The [[Ustaše|Croatian Ustaše]] destroyed the house again. After the establishment of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Communist Yugoslavia]] in 1944, the house of Gavrilo Princip became a museum again and there was another museum dedicated to him within the city of Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meettheslavs.com/gavrilo-princip-things-never-change/ |title=GAVRILO PRINCIP – SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE |date=29 June 2014 |publisher=Meet the Slavs |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226184445/http://meettheslavs.com/gavrilo-princip-things-never-change/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s, the house of Gavrilo Princip was destroyed a third time; no attempts to rebuild it have yet been announced. Prior to 1992 the site on the pavement on which Princip stood to fire the fatal shots was marked by embossed footprints. These were destroyed as a consequence of the 1992–95 [[war in Bosnia]]. There is still a plaque in front of the museum at the spot where Gavrilo Princip stood when he fired the shots. [[Bosansko Grahovo]] municipality has announced a plan to reconstruct Princip's birth house in [[Obljaj]] before the centenary of the assassination in Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/region/Obnova-kuce-Gavrila-Principa.lt.html Обнова куће Гаврила Принципа (in Serbian) /Start of work on the reconstruction of the birth house of Gavrilo Princip in the village of Obljaj, politika.rs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bosnia-wwi-princip-idUSBREA2A08U20140311 |title=An assassin divides his native Bosnia 100 years on |author1=Matt Robinson |author2=Daria Sito-Sucic |date=11 March 2004 |newspaper=Reuters |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226184247/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bosnia-wwi-princip-idUSBREA2A08U20140311 |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4740">'''Gayno Smith'''  or '''Gayno Gilbert Smith''' (January 23, 1938 – May 16, 2005) was a [[mass murderer]] from Iowa, who killed six people in 1961 and 1962.

Before the murders Smith had been living in Denver, Colorado, but due to problems there had come to [[Martinsburg, Iowa]] to live with his stepmother. When he had problems with her as well, he moved to the home of his uncle Andrew and lived there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein, Mike 2005&quot;&gt;Klein, Mike. &quot;A bloody night: More than 40 years later, memories won't fade&quot;, ''Des Moines Register'', June 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
On May 27, 1962,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A list of Iowa's worst mass killings&quot;, ''Des Moines Resister'' http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061014/NEWS01/102070002&lt;/ref&gt; Smith murdered Andrew McBeth, 51,&lt;ref name=&quot;iagenweb.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iagenweb.org/boards/keokuk/queries/index.cgi?read=76134|title=Re: McBeth family|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dora McBeth, 41,&lt;ref name=&quot;iagenweb.org&quot;/&gt; and their three children: Amos and Anna McBeth, 19, and Donna Jean Kellogg, 17. Smith, then 24, a nephew of the elder McBeths', confessed to the crime. He also confessed to having murdered his stepmother, Juanita Smith, who had been missing for several months.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimezzz.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkiller_news/S/SMITH_gayno_gilbert.php|title=Serial Killer True Crime Library|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The McBeth family lived in rural Iowa, about four miles north of Martinsburg, and Gayno Smith had been living with them at the time. Another daughter, Patsy Lou, 15, was wounded by Smith but escaped in the night and ran to a nearby farm for help. Kellogg's six-month-old baby, Perry, was in a crib and left unharmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimezzz.net&quot;/&gt;

On the night of the murders, the McBeth children – Amos, Anna, and Donna Jean – had driven to Brighton, Iowa for a dance and Donna Jean, as was her custom, had left her infant in the care of her parents. &quot;Smith remained at the dance a short time, then disappeared until midnight, according to court records. He came back to pick up the group after the dance ended. Thunder, lightning and heavy rain began as the five went to a truck stop for food. When they returned to their farmhouse, the lights were out.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Klein, Mike 2005&quot;/&gt;

The children found flashlights and made their way around the house to investigate. Donna and Amos found the murdered bodies of their parents in the garage, where they'd been dragged. They tried to call for help but discovered the lines had been cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein, Mike 2005&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Suddenly, Smith appeared before them with a flashlight and a gun. He shot Amos in the face, then Donna. He shot Patsy in the shoulder. Though badly wounded, Amos pleaded for his life but was shot again. Patsy escaped to another room where she found her older sister, Anna, already dead.

&quot;Smith chased her to a ditch in the countryside. She played cat and mouse through the ditches, crawling and crouching to escape his roving flashlight through the early morning hours. She finally reached a nearby farmhouse, where she called her uncle, Firman McBeth.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Klein, Mike 2005&quot;/&gt;

Smith went into hiding but was found four days later in a barn near [[Lake Wapello]]. After being arrested, he confessed both to the McBeth murders in Martinsburg and also to the murder of his stepmother, Juanita Smith, the previous October in [[Hedrick, Iowa]]. Smith was sentenced to five life terms for first-degree murder and one 50-year term for second-degree murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimezzz.net&quot;/&gt;

Infant Perry was adopted by his uncle Firman, Andrew McBeth's brother, and raised with Firman's own nine biological children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein, Mike 2005&quot;/&gt;

Perry, the child in the crib, has spoken about the problems he faced growing up. &quot;All the way through school I was a bully because I wanted people to hurt as bad as I did. I hated everything and everybody,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm sorry about that now. When I see those people today, I try to tell them that, but they just don't understand.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Klein, Mike 2005&quot;/&gt;

Perry graduated from [[Pekin Community High School (Iowa)|Pekin Community High School]]

Gayno Smith's body was cremated and buried in Mount Zion Cemetery next to the plot of his mother.

==Background==
Gee Jon was born of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] descent in [[China]] around 1895. He immigrated to the United States between 1907 and 1908 and spent most of his life at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;UncoveringNevadasPast-2004&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AsianAmerica-1988&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniels|first=Roger|title=Asian America: Chinese and Japanese in the United States since 1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiQE317r3mgC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=Gee+Jon|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|page=85|year=1988|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gee became a member of the [[Hip Sing Tong]] society,&lt;ref name=&quot;UncoveringNevadasPast-2004&quot; /&gt; which dealt in narcotics and liquor. In 1922, territorial disputes with the rival [[Bing Kong Tong]] society led to the outbreak of hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;AsianAmerica-1988&quot; /&gt;

==Death of Tom Quong Kee==

Tom Quong Kee was a 74-year-old laundry proprietor who was a member of the Bing Kong Tong in [[Mina, Nevada]]. Hughie Sing, his American-educated apprentice of two years, pointed Kee out as a target for Gee. During the night of August 27, 1921, Gee knocked on the door of Kee's residence while armed with a [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] .38 [[revolver]]. Gee fatally shot Kee, who answered the door in his pajamas. Unlike many other [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] killings, Gee and Sing were apprehended.&lt;ref name=&quot;AsianAmerica-1988&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheLastGasp-2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Christianson|first=Scott|title=The Last Gasp: The Rise and Fall of the American Gas Chamber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIzaoHoggUwC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Gee+Jon|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|page=1|year=2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and sentencing===
Gee and Sing were defended by attorneys James M.

==Execution==
[[File:NV Gov Denver Dickerson.jpg|thumb|[[Denver S. Dickerson]] supervised the execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;UncoveringNevadasPast-2004&quot; /&gt;]]
The California Cyanide Company of [[Los Angeles, California]], was the only distributor of liquid [[cyanide]] in the western United States and refused to deliver it to Carson City over [[legal liability|liability]] concerns. The poison was used to eradicate pests from [[citrus fruit|citrus]] groves in California. Warden [[Denver S. Dickerson]] sent his assistant Tom Pickett to Los Angeles to personally pick up 20 pounds of lethal gas, which was contained in a mobile fumigating unit that cost $700. Four guards who did not want to participate in the process had resigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;FatalAirs-2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Christianson|first=Scott|title=Fatal Airs: The Deadly History and Apocalyptic Future of Lethal Gases That Threaten Our World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sH7DBd8XLMcC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Gee+Jon|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|pages=49–51|year=2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officials first attempted to pump poison gas directly into Gee's cell while he was sleeping,&lt;ref name=&quot;Top10DeathPenaltyMyths-2007&quot; /&gt; but without success because the gas leaked from the cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;DPIC-Descriptions&quot; /&gt;

A makeshift [[gas chamber]] was set up at the butcher shop of the prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;HandbookDeathDying-2003&quot; /&gt; At least one cat was used to test the lethal effectiveness of the chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Example-LIRCUS-1975&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Chan|first=Loren|title=Example for the Nation: Nevada's Execution of Gee Jon|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Lc_XTPnLO5O0sAPK4qSNCw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=fql1AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kittens|work=The Life, influence, and the role of the Chinese in the United States, 1776-1960|publisher=[[Chinese Historical Society of America]]|page=109|year=1976|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gee was to be strapped onto a chair in the chamber, which was eleven feet long, ten feet wide, and eight feet high.&lt;ref name=&quot;UncoveringNevadasPast-2004&quot; /&gt; A small window next to the wooden chair allowed witnesses to look inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;HandbookDeathDying-2003&quot; /&gt; Attendees included news reporters, public health officials, and representatives of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FatalAirs-2010&quot; /&gt; Gee wept as he was placed on the chair until the captain of the guards told him to &quot;Brace up!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CP-US-1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Vila|first=Bryan|title=Capital Punishment in the United States: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjEFAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Gee+Jon&amp;dq=Gee+Jon|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|pages=78–79|year=1997|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 9:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. on February 8, 1924,&lt;ref name=&quot;FatalAirs-2010&quot; /&gt; the pump sprayed four pounds of [[hydrocyanic acid]] into the chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;UncoveringNevadasPast-2004&quot; /&gt; The weather was cold and humid.&lt;ref name=&quot;FatalAirs-2010&quot; /&gt; Because an electric heater failed, the chamber was 52 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 75 degrees, causing some of the acid to form a puddle on the floor. Gee appeared to lose consciousness in about five seconds, with his head continuing to nod up and down for six minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;UncoveringNevadasPast-2004&quot; /&gt; He was completely motionless after ten minutes. Some of the witnesses momentarily thought they smelled the odor of almond blossoms, a telltale sign of cyanide, leaking from the chamber. The warden had the witnesses cleared from the area. At about 10 a.m., a vent was opened and a fan was turned on to discharge the poison gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;FatalAirs-2010&quot; /&gt; The prison staff waited for the remaining puddle of hydrocyanic acid to evaporate before cleaning up the chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheDeathPenalty-2002-p198&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Banner|first=Stuart|title=The Death Penalty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzayhpsWJ5oC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=Gee+Jon|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=198|year=2002|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gee's body was removed from the chamber at 12:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. and taken to the prison hospital. A group of seven doctors pronounced him dead, but did not conduct an autopsy on the body out of concern that some remaining gas could be released.&lt;ref name=&quot;FatalAirs-2010&quot; /&gt; Gee was 29 years old when he died.&lt;ref name=&quot;NV-Archives-Jon&quot; /&gt;

===Reaction===
The ''[[Nevada State Journal]]'' proclaimed, &quot;Nevada's novel death law is upheld by the highest court — humanity.&quot; However, the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' printed, &quot;One hundred years from now Nevada will be referred to as a heathen commonwealth controlled by savages with only the outward symbols of civilization.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FatalAirs-2010&quot; /&gt;

Warden Dickerson reported to Nevada governor [[James G. Scrugham]] and the legislature his opinion that the use of lethal gas was impractical and that he thought [[execution by firing squad]] was still the best method of execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;UncoveringNevadasPast-2004&quot; /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Geese Howard'''|ギース・ハワード|Gīsu Hawādo}} is a fictional [[Boss (video gaming)|video game character]] appearing in [[SNK]]'s ''[[Fatal Fury (series)|Fatal Fury]]'' [[fighting game]]s series. Debuting in ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters]]'', Geese is the local crime boss of the fictional city of South Town. Geese hosts a fighting tournament named &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, in which he faces the brothers [[Terry Bogard|Terry]] and [[List of Fatal Fury characters#Andy Bogard|Andy Bogard]] who want to take revenge for their father's death. After several tournaments, Geese is killed by Terry, but he appears in following games without storyline as a &quot;ghost&quot; named {{nihongo|'''Nightmare Geese'''|ナイトメア・ギース|Naitomea Gīsu}}. Geese has also appeared in several ''[[The King of Fighters]]'' games, in which he seeks to get the power from the creature Orochi, while his young self makes an appearance in the second ''[[Art of Fighting]]'' game as the hidden boss character.

==Character design==
In the ''Fatal Fury'' and ''The King of Fighters'', Geese appears as a middle-aged [[German American]] man with blond short, slicked hair, wearing an [[aikidogi]] with red [[hakama]] and white [[uwagi]] without sandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=December 2004  |pages=77|  title=The King of Fighters Fighting Evolution 10th| language=Japanese | publisher=SNK Playmore | isbn=978-4-575-16431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most games of the ''Fatal Fury'' and ''The King of Fighters'' series—except ''Fatal Fury: King of Fighters'' and ''The King of Fighters '96''—Geese only wears the red hakama pants with the white uwagi either not present or hanging off the back/sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=December 2004  |pages=139|  title=The King of Fighters Fighting Evolution 10th| language=Japanese | publisher=SNK Playmore | isbn=978-4-575-16431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dominated Mind'', the PlayStation version of ''Real Bout Special'', features Geese sporting a halo over his head as a reference to his passing, while the arcade version of ''Real Bout Special'' and ''The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match'' features Geese sporting an aura of chi surrounding his feet, which would later be canonized in ''Maximum Impact 2'' as &quot;Nightmare Geese&quot;. The appearance of Geese in the ''Art of Fighting'' series was of a younger man with long blond hair wearing a light purple and blue suit with red necktie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=December 2004  |pages=112|  title=The King of Fighters Fighting Evolution 10th| language=Japanese | publisher=SNK Playmore | isbn=978-4-575-16431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

===In video games===
Geese first appears in the original ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters|Fatal Fury]]'', where he hosts the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; tournament. The central plot of the game centers around the Bogard brothers' ([[Terry Bogard|Terry]] and [[list of Fatal Fury characters#Andy Bogard|Andy]]) quest to avenge their father's death, who was murdered by Geese a decade before the events of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|level=Terry Bogard background|title=Fatal Fury: King of Fighters|developer=SNK |publisher=SNK |date=1991-12-20 |quote=&quot;After the death of his father, Jeff Bogard, a talented martial arts, Terry left his home in Southtown.

In the next game, ''[[Real Bout Fatal Fury]]'', Geese is once again the final boss in the single-player tournament, confronting the player atop Geese Tower.

Geese also makes an appearance in the second game in the ''[[Art of Fighting]]'' series. ''Art of Fighting 2'', which is set a decade before the first ''Fatal Fury'',  features a younger Geese Howard as the corrupt police commissioner of Southtown. Geese is revealed to be [[list of Art of Fighting characters#Mr. Big|Mr. Big]]'s boss and the mastermind behind the events of the previous game such as the kidnapping of [[Yuri Sakazaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|level=Intro sequence|title=Art of Fighting 2|developer=SNK |publisher=SNK |date=1994-09-02|platform=Neo Geo }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player wins every match against all the previous computer-controlled opponents without losing a round, the player's character will face Geese Howard as a hidden final boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|level=Ryo Sakazaki ending|title=Art of Fighting 2|developer=SNK |publisher=SNK |date=1994-09-02 |quote='''Ryo:''' I will never forgive you!/'''Geese:''' Heh!

Geese Howard also appears in a trilogy of animated films based on the ''Fatal Fury'' video games, where his voice is provided by [[Hidekatsu Shibata]] in the  original Japanese versions and [[Ward Perry]] in the English dubs. The first two installments, 1992's ''[[Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf]]'' and 1993's ''[[Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle]]'', both aired in Japan as TV specials on [[Fuji TV]], while the third film, 1994's ''[[Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture]]'', was a theatrical film. The English adaptations of all three films were released on home video by [[Viz Media|Viz Communications]].

Video games publications have added praise and criticism on Geese's character.

'''Gemma Teller Morrow''' (''née'' '''Madock'''), is a [[fictional character]] on the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] television series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'', played by [[Katey Sagal]]. Gemma is the widow of [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#John Teller|John Teller]], wife of [[Clay Morrow]] and mother of [[Jax Teller]]. She is unapologetic about the lengths she'll go to in order to protect the club, and is beloved by all of its members. She and Clay are arguably the series' main [[antagonist]]s.

== Biography ==
Gemma was born November 18, 1957 to Nate and Rose and is a native of [[Charming, California]]; her maiden name is Madock. According to Sheriff [[Wayne Unser]], she left Charming when she was sixteen and returned &quot;ten years later with a baby and a motorcycle club&quot;. She married [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#John Teller|John Teller]], a [[Vietnam War]] [[Vietnam veteran|veteran]] and founder of the [[Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club]], with whom she had two children: [[Jax Teller|Jackson]] in 1978 and Thomas in 1984.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Gemma has a scar on her chest which is explained when her grandson Abel has surgery. Gemma has a genetic heart disorder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://communityvoices.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in-journal/30830-tv-qaa-sons-of-anarchy-sweet-genius-and-a-familiar-voice-on-a-local-ad||title=TV Q&amp;A: 'Sons of Anarchy,' 'Sweet Genius' and a familiar voice on a local ad|last=Owen|first=Rob|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=2011-11-18|accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; from her mother's side which she passed on to her children - Thomas died in 1990 from complications of the disorder, and Abel nearly died from heart complications after his premature birth. After John was hit by a semi-truck and died in 1993, she quickly married John's friend [[Clay Morrow]].

===Season One===
Gemma Teller Morrow is the queen of Charming and the matriarch of the Sons of Anarchy. A [[Machiavellian]] schemer and expert in [[psychological manipulation]], Gemma is extremely protective of her son and grandson, and she longs for the day when Jax will, in her eyes, be ready to assume control over [[SAMCRO]] to ensure the organization's survival for another generation. She adores her husband, Clay, and does her best to make things work out his way. Many of SAMCRO's plans succeed because of Gemma's quiet intervention (e.g., finding out who raped the little girl at the carnival in episode &quot;Fun Town,&quot; and surveillance of L.O.A.N. in season two). She generally has a hostile attitude toward all of Jax's female friends and partners, including his ex-wife Wendy; his on-again, off-again girlfriend Tara (although Gemma later takes Tara under her wing); and the club &quot;groupies&quot; with whom he occasionally has sex. Her tough, but relatively classy, image includes hair highlights and a tattoo on her breast. Nord boss [[Ernest Darby]] has indicated that he had a prior romantic interest in her. She claims to be part Jewish &quot;on the angry Russian side.&quot;

===Season Two===
Early in season Gemma is raped by Sons of Anarchy rival AJ Weston and two other unknown men wearing white masks. During the assault, Gemma is told to tell Clay that it will happen again if he does not end his dealings with minorities. Later, Gemma realizes Weston is one of her rapists, when she recognizes his tattoos. When her friend Unser finds her at the rape scene, Gemma demands that he not tell Clay or Jax about the rape so as not to play into AJ Weston and Ethan Zobelle's plans to get Clay and/or Jax to do something rash. Unser complies and further covers up the source of Gemma's injuries by crashing her car into a road divider and taking her to the hospital. The only other person whom Gemma confides in about the rape is Tara Knowles, Jax's girlfriend. Unser later realizes that Chief Deputy Hale is starting to become more involved with Zobelle and his people and tells Hale about Gemma's assault. This causes Hale to re-evaluate his dealing with Zobelle. The rape leaves Gemma with significant and visible emotional trauma, which causes problems in her marriage with Clay. She also feels somewhat paranoid that AJ might try to attack her again. Her paranoia is further compounded when someone from L.O.A.N. mails one of the rapists' white masks to her.

When Gemma learns of Jax's plans to become a Nomad, she tells him that she knows about the book her first husband, Jax's father John Teller, had written. She tells Jax  she believes John's death may not have been an accident, but rather a suicide. After asking Jax to reconsider his decision, she implores him to read a certain page in John's book, hoping it will give him guidance and perhaps change his mind. The book fails to make Jax decide to stay and when the vote needed to allow him to leave is taken, it passes. Upon learning that Jax still plans to become a Nomad, Gemma calls together her son, Tara, and husband Clay at her home and reveals, fairly graphically, the details of her assault and gang rape. As a result, Jax picks up the jacket patches he had removed from his vest after the vote, which indicates that Jax has decided to stay with SAMCRO. The following morning, feeling unwanted by Clay, Gemma comes on to an emotionally wrecked [[Tig Trager|Tig]], who reciprocates her advances, but stops when he sees a picture of Jax and Thomas at the beach as children. Later, Tig is guilt-ridden and proceeds to confess to [[Opie Winston#Opie Winston|Opie]] about [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Donna Winston|Donna]]'s murder. Then, outside the church where Unser's support group meets, Gemma is approached by the priest who runs the support group; he offers her advice to serve others in order to deal with her own self-loathing. Back at the garage, she runs into [[Chibs Telford|Chibs]], who is distraught about his dealings with [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] agent Stahl. She comforts him and advises him to come clean with the club. After the club meeting, Tig tells Clay, at the end of the day, that Gemma thinks he does not want her anymore; Clay proceeds to the office and shows that he still wants Gemma. When the club goes on lock-down, Gemma looks after other families. She tells Tara she (Tara) does not have to take crap from anyone, because she is the old lady of the Vice President. Gemma has been teaching Tara, because she will one day be the queen of the club. Inspired by Gemma, Tara stands up to her supervisor at the hospital, assaulting her at one point when she calls Gemma a whore.

In the second-season finale, Gemma happens to come across Polly Zobelle. Wanting to get revenge and also do her part for SAMCRO, she follows Polly to Edmond Hayes' house. She sends Tara home and sneaks onto the property, where she finds a distraught Polly brandishing a gun. Polly attempts to shoot, so Gemma kills her in self-defense. She then discovers Edmond Hayes' body and ATF Agent Stahl, saying that both of them had a bloody day. Stahl offers to let her leave, but not before tossing her sidearm to Gemma, who catches it. Gemma instantly realizes Stahl's trick to get her fingerprints on the murder weapon, and flees. At a bus stop payphone, she calls Police Chief Wayne Unser for help. She is last seen fleeing Charming with Unser with no idea where to go.

===Season Three===
Gemma is still on the run at the beginning of Season 3. Tig is keeping her at a motel until Clay and SAMCRO can figure out a way to clear her name. Clay elects not to tell Gemma that Abel has been kidnapped, because he believes she already has enough to worry about.

While at the motel, Gemma reads her mother's obituary in a newspaper, which disturbs her. Gemma's poor relationship with her mother is reinforced when Opie gives Jax his condolences for the loss, and Jax dismisses it, stating that &quot;he hardly knew her that well.&quot;

Eventually, Gemma convinces Tig to help her sneak away. They end up in Oregon, at the house of her father, a reverend who is suffering from late-stage [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. After an incident involving Tig and the Guatemalan caretaker, which results in Tig's being shot, Gemma requests Tara's assistance.

After the caretaker discovers that Gemma is [[Fugitive|wanted]] and that there is a hefty reward for her capture, Gemma ties her up in the basement of her father's home. Shortly thereafter, the caretaker escapes by overpowering Tara. The caretaker then attempts to overpower Gemma but is accidentally killed in struggle with Gemma and Tara.

Soon, Gemma makes the hard decision to move her father into an [[assisted living]] home. Gemma then breaks down, escapes in Tara's car, and contacts Agent Stahl.

Tara and Tig inform the club that Gemma has disappeared, and Jax realizes that she was heading home to be with Abel. However, upon returning home, Gemma discovers that Abel had been kidnapped. This aggravates her heart condition, and she ends up in the hospital. Gemma had made a deal to turn herself in to Stahl upon her return to Charming, in exchange for not receiving the death penalty for the murders of Edmund Hayes and Polly Zoebelle. However, Stahl reneges on the deal, informing Gemma that because she did not turn herself in at the agreed-upon time (because she was in the hospital), Gemma has violated the terms of the deal. Later, Jax secretly works out a deal with Stahl, wherein he will give Stahl information on the IRA and get her back in the good graces of the ATF, in exchange for help with his mother. (Stahl had been demoted and taken off the IRA case following the events at the end of season 2.) Stahl then supplies Jax with a statement for Gemma to give to the ATF, in which Gemma states the real events of the Hayes and Zoebelle shooting, except that Gemma fingered another ATF agent for the Edmund Hayes shooting.

In &quot;Widening Gyre&quot;, Gemma finds out that John Teller had an affair in Belfast in the late 1980s, which produced a daughter. She makes up her mind to go to Belfast with Clay and Jax, and employs Tara's help in breaking out of police custody. After a tense standoff with Wayne Unser, Gemma successfully makes it to the airport with SAMCRO.

Once she and SAMCRO arrive in Belfast, the Sons are in danger of being deported to America. When they are all in the van, Gemma forces a SAMBEL (Sons of Anarchy Belfast) member to run the police off the road. After SAMCRO's release from police custody, they head to the SAMBEL clubhouse, where Gemma meets Maureen and Trinity Ashby. Gemma and Maureen talk privately later, and Maureen tells Gemma they should continue to keep the secret about John's being Trinity's father. However, Jax and Trinity are attracted to each other, and Gemma tells him that Trinity is his sister, after finding them in a compromising position.

The next day Gemma, Jax, and Opie go to the orphanage to get Abel. When they get there, they are under orders of Father Ashby, who tries to prevent them from taking Abel home by lying about knowing where Abel is. Gemma sees right through this, takes the baby hostage, and threatens to kill Ashby. When the Irish finally tell where Abel is, Gemma gives the baby back, and Jax goes to find him. When Jax returns without Abel, he tells his mother that neither he nor Abel belongs there, and Abel belongs with the other family. Gemma is enraged that Jax is willing to give up his own son and tells him Tara is pregnant. When father Ashby shows up, it is revealed that Sean Casey was tortured, and the priest tells them that Jimmy is now after Abel. Everyone, including Gemma, tries to get to the hotel to save Abel, only to find they are too late. After a deal is made between Jimmy and the True IRA, Abel returns home with his true family.

Once back in Charming, the club is trying to find Tara, and Gemma is struggling with the deal Jax made with Stahl. Gemma knows it does not matter how much the rest of the club loves him; if they find out he is ratting, they will kill him without hesitation. Jax is still confident that nothing will go wrong and promises her that everything and everyone will be all right. Gemma, still afraid, decides to take Stahl at gunpoint and force to kill the deal, warning that if Stahl doesn't end the deal she will turn herself in and tell where her previous statement really came from. She later greets Tara and hugs her for her safe return from Salazar.

In the season 3 finale, Gemma is still worried about the deal Jax made with Stahl. When she sees that the deal is still on, and Jax is giving up the head of the IRA, she tries to turn herself in, only to find out that it is too late, because Stahl already gave her statement clearing her of the killings. Gemma warns Stahl that someone will get hurt.

When Clay comes to see Gemma in jail, she tells him they can't look at Jax the same way they saw John Teller, because club has been in desperate times. At the end, she sees Jax arrive with Stahl and watches with sadness as Stahl sets up Jax to die at the hands of his own club, by exposing the deal they made. But Gemma gets some relief after Jax sends her a letter explaining that he was never a rat; the deal was a trap the entire club was in on, and the only reason they didn't tell her was to keep her from being an accessory if things went awry. At the end, it is strongly insinuated, via a letter John wrote his mistress Maureen, that Gemma and Clay are responsible for John Teller's death.

===Season Four===

At the beginning of season four, we see Gemma is continuing her duties as the Queen of SAMCRO. She is one of the first people, along with Tara, to welcome home the members of SAMCRO who had been in prison for fourteen months. She later visits Unser, who has sold his business and moved into a trailer in the woods. After she and Clay have sex to properly welcome him home, she tells him that Unser needs him and the club to go on living. Gemma later attends Opie's wedding. After the wedding, she goes to Jax's house to check on the boys and she finds a note that suggest Maureen Ashby gave John Teller's letter to Jax to read. The next day she tells Clay about what she found and he tells her not to worry about it. Later she discovers that Jax hadn't read them, but Tara has. She tells Tara that the letters will only hurt their family. But more piles on when Piney tells her about wanting the club to mule drugs. When she confronts Clay and tries to order him not to do it, he makes her know that she is not the boss of him. When the club goes to Tucson for the drug run, she confronts Piney about his beef with Clay and tells him to let it go before he gets himself killed, but he won't back down. In the next episode, Clay tells Gemma about the confrontation with Piney were Piney tells Clay he knows the truth about John Teller's death. She not only worries about the truth coming out, but also about Clay when he suggests killing Tara and Piney as they are they only other two people who know the truth. She talks him out of it. She later goes to Unser who she tells to get the letters as he too was involved in the murder of John by helping cover it up. Later, she goes to get the letters and discovers that Unser burned them. She shows the ashes to Clay, unaware that he read them.

Later in the season, Gemma discovers Piney's dead body and immediately knows it was Clay who killed him. She learns from Unser that Clay not only read the letters, but the ones he read were actually copies meaning Tara still has the originals. Unser wants to turn Clay in, but Gemma convinces him otherwise. Later she and Clay talk about the situation and she tells him that they will simply add Piney's death to their list of secrets and she will convince Tara to give her the letters. She makes Clay promise her that he will not hurt Tara.

The next day, Gemma sees Clay take money out of their safe and hours later someone tries to kidnap Tara. When Gemma confronts Clay, they end up fighting leaving Gemma badly beaten. Afterwards, Gemma realizes that Clay is beyond salvation and he has to die at the hand of the son. The next day, she learns that Jax and Tara are planning to leave SAMCRO and Charming. She also discovers that Wendy has returned and wants to be a part of Abel's life and confronts her. When Unser tells Opie what happened to Piney to get Opie to kill Clay she tells him to try to stop it, because she wants Jax to do it. Unser is unable to stop it and Clay ends up shot by Opie, but he survived. Gemma then convinces Tara to give her the letters. Once she has them she takes out the ones that implicates her and Unser and gives the rest to Jax. She tells Jax everything that Clay has done and then tells Jax to kill Clay and take his place at the head of the table as the President of SAMCRO. While Jax is reading the letters, Gemma and Tara talk and Tara lets her that she knew about Gemma's plan to keep them in Charming. When Jax comes out after reading the letters Tara gives Jax a way to kill Clay and tells him that once it is done to come take her and their sons out of Charming.  He promises that he will. Gemma is forced to watch her plan to have Jax become the next president fall apart. When she asks what Tara is doing, Tara tells her everything Gemma taught her. Tara then tells Gemma that Jax is hers. The same day Gemma sees Jax in the hospital coming out of Clay's room and tries to beg him to stay and Jax tells her that he is not leaving and that Clay won't hurt her again. When she goes into the room she sees that Clay is still alive. Later, Gemma burns the letters that implicate her in John's death and when the men are having church she sees Jax at the head of the table and Tara standing behind him.

===Season Five===
Gemma is now very independent from Clay as she is seen having sex with Nero Padilla in the very first scene, but it was later revealed that she had been consuming a great deal of alcohol and drugs, did not recall a thing from the previous night, tried to shoot Nero upon waking and had even given him a fake name. Later they officially introduce each other and she gives him her phone number. Once she arrives at her home she catches Clay digging through her belongings, claiming to be looking for a ring, then he asks for a moment of Gemma's time and after hearing him out, he tries to touch her and she drops him to the floor warning that he will never lay a hand on her again. She later organizes for SAMCRO to stay at Nero's day spa while they hide from the law in order to stop them from being alone and unprotected in prison, much against Tara's wishes, despite both Gemma and Jax explaining that if they were to go to prison they would most likely be attacked, if not killed. Clay, who still has feeling for her, comes over to pay Nero a visit; when Gemma arrives and sees Clay with an escort, she fights her. As a result, the police raid the brothel and gets everyone arrested. During the time Gemma is separated from Clay, she goes out and gets drunk and does drugs, one time, when Jax and Tara decide to go to the cabin to be alone, Jax insists that Gemma keep the boys, she agrees to do so, when she is driving, she drives under the influence of Marijuana and her vehicle goes off the road, injuring Abel in the process. When Jax and Tara hear the news, Tara believes that Gemma was driving stoned, but Clay lies saying that she was attacked instead; when Jax gets to the truth, he now knows that Gemma was driving stoned, as a result, they cut her out of their lives for good, however, Jax gives her a chance to get back into their lives by making her get back with Clay so he could get him to confess about a series of home invasions that he could possibly be behind to set up SAMCRO; Gemma is hesitant to go along with the idea but agrees to it, it also means shutting out Nero as well. Gemma's efforts to get Clay to confess seem worthwhile, after Clay confesses to SAMCRO that he was indeed behind the break ins, he is banished from SAMCRO once and for all, IRA boss, Galen O'Shay offers Clay to go to Belfast to oversee business deals for the true IRA, but on the condition that Gemma goes. Gemma slightly agrees to go along. As they are ready to leave, the police show up and arrest Clay for murdering Damon Pope, Gemma lies saying he went somewhere.

===Season Six===
When Gemma finds out Tara took Abel and Thomas, she thinks she went to the feds to make a deal, in truth, Jax surrenders himself over so Tara can be clear of the murder of Pam Toric. Gemma, in a fit of rage, kills her while Juice kills Eli Roosevelt to cover up the deed.

===Season Seven===
Gemma continues to feel guilt over killing Tara, she hides Juice from the club. While alone, she talks to herself as if she is having a conversation with Tara. When Jax is set free, she says that it was the Chinese that killed Tara, Jax starts an all out war with Henry Lin while Gemma continues to feed Jax lies. Abel is having difficulty with Tara's death, he overhears Gemma tell Thomas that she was sorry for killing her, he begins cutting himself as a result, when [[child services]] find out about the cuts, he says Gemma did it. Jax learns from Abel that Gemma killed Tara. Jax goes to Juice and gets the full truth about what happened. Gemma goes to her family home in Oregon. Wayne goes to Oregon to bring Gemma back.

{{nihongo|'''Gen'''|元|Gen|lead=yes}} is a [[Player character|character]] in [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Street Fighter]]'' [[versus fighting game|fighting game]] series. Gen is introduced in the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' and he has returned for ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'' series and ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' series. He is a Chinese martial arts master and former assassin who uses legendary fighting techniques. Gen is currently the only character in the Street Fighter series who can switch between fighting styles (having two of them) during a match, and one of the few characters in fighting games with multiple movesets. He also notably taught [[Chun-Li]] the art of [[Tai Chi]]. Gen is known for his quote in English, spoken to a defeated opponent: &quot;You are a big fool!&quot;

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Gen was known as one of the legends of martial arts, supposedly being the &quot;man who killed hundreds&quot;. He was not only a great martial artist, but a legendary assassin, said to be invincible. Gen was also a friend of Chun-Li's father, and he briefly trained her in her youth. Gen also owned a restaurant called Genhanten in Sendai, Japan - where he met [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] for the first time. Gen first appears in the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' as the second opponent the player faces from [[Peoples' Republic of China|China]] in the single-player tournament (the first one being [[List of Street Fighter characters #Lee|Lee]]). Gen entered the first World Warrior tournament to find worthy opponents. When he did not, he went back to the streets of China. Gen resurfaces as a playable character in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]''. In the storyline of the Alpha series, he was diagnosed with leukemia, and did not have much time to live. Gen did not blame his loss in the first tournament on his illness. At first, he decided he would be careful and just manage his restaurant, but old foes sent assassins who made repeated attempts on him and his family's lives. Due to this, he decided he would stop hiding and go out fighting, in a blaze of glory, as he felt it was a more honorable way to die. He went on a search for a worthy opponent, taking on members of Shadaloo and other crime syndicates, to provoke a fight to the death in which he would meet his demise. Word got around about [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]], a fighter who fully embraced the Satsui no Hado. After seeking him out, Gen challenged him to a fight that he hoped would be decisive. The two fought fiercely until the end, each surviving the other's finishing blow. However, Akuma sensed that Gen was terminally ill, making it an unfair fight. Thus, Akuma decided to end the match, leaving him to his fate. Eventually, Gen challenged Akuma once again, but although the results of the battle are unknown, Gen did survive. When Gen and Akuma fight during the game's story mode, they perform their signature moves on each other before the fight begins, re-enacting the fight described above. Gen appears as an additional character  in the home versions of ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'' and its updates. In the storyline of Street Fighter IV, Gen is haunted by nightmares where he is surrounded on all sides by the ghosts of those he has killed in the past when he was still an assassin. Scorning the ghosts, he proclaims that while he is still alive, he will not succumb to the likes of them. Reflecting on how Chun-Li has grown into a strong and admirable woman, he knows he cannot protect her for much longer, as his time is running short. He remembers the day when his illness allowed Shadaloo to capture her father; cursing his body and its &quot;infernal frailties&quot;, he vows not to let them get away. He joins the S.I.N. organized tournament, and at some point Chun-Li finds him and demands that he tell her all that he knows about what happened to her father. Gen refuses and fades away, leaving her alone. When the S.I.N. base is destroyed, Gen protects Chun-Li from the ensuing collapse, though it's not shown how. While partially trapped under the rubble, Gen witnesses Akuma and Gouken fight over an unconscious Ryu, internally referring to the two fighters as &quot;Life and Death&quot;. He muses that &quot;Death is indeed strong.&quot; Impressed by what he called their &quot;ultimate battle&quot;, in which both men were &quot;prepared to give up the ghost&quot;, Gen resolves not to die until &quot;the final battle between Life and Death&quot;, so he returns to what he calls &quot;my own fight to the death&quot;. Gen appears in Akuma's character story in ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', locked in combat with the demonic martial artist. Gen observes Akuma's newfound power, and ponders as to whether or not he has become a &quot;true demon god&quot;, before realizing he has not attained this level of power yet. Gen laughs, stating that Akuma will never reach the path of the divine if he does not know the path of humanity. Akuma calls Gen weak, striking him down with a Satsui no Hado-infused punch. Gen's words echo in Akuma's head, and as he walks away from Gen's unconscious form, he remarks that he has no interest in for the path of humanity or the divine, and only walks the path of the demon, leaving Gen's fate uncertain. Gen also makes a cameo appearance in one of the stages in ''[[Super Gem Fighter: Mini Mix]]''.

====Character design====
Gen is an elderly man who often has a stern look on his face. He is among the shortest male characters in the series, standing at just 5'5&quot;. Gen wears a loose, purple outfit with a red sash around his clothes, and red Chinese martial art shoes with white socks. He has white hair with a long, white beard. In the original Street Fighter, he had black pupils in his eyes; in his more recent incarnations, his eyes are now completely white in color. Prior to his recent appearance in Street Fighter IV, Gen had short hair. In the Street Fighter IV games, his hair not only has grown much longer but he also keeps it tied in a formal bun with a purple Chinese qipao on the back of his head. In most recent games his skin also has aging wrinkles in his entire body, most notably his face. 

====Gameplay and fighting style====
Gen's fighting style incorporates various kung fu styles that he has utilized in his assassinations. As of ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'', this is reflected in the ability to switch between two fighting styles during gameplay: Mantis (Sou) and Crane (Ki). Gen is at his best with both styles utilized in tandem, often switching between Mantis and Crane mid-attack; however, this makes him a difficult character to learn and master, and his low stun and stamina leave even less room for error. Gen's two styles use opposite approaches: The Mantis style focuses on ground-based pressure, spacing, and approaching, with special attacks that can act as solid reversals, among other defensive functions. The more offensive Crane style uses a multi-angle approach, with normal and special moves tailored to confuse and punish foes, and unique standard normals (such as an overhead standing medium punch and low-hitting standing heavy punch). In the ''Street Fighter Alpha'' series, Gen and [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]] are the among only characters to retain their 'natural' Chain Combo abilities, and both would carry this trait into later appearances.

===In other media===
[[UDON]]'s comic book adaptation of the ''Street Fighter'' series  delves into some of Gen's history as well as giving him a fairly pivotal role in the second arc of the series. In a past life, he was an assassin who gives up his life of murder to repay for his sins. It is during this time that he trains a young Chun-Li and is forced to kill another assassin (who appears to be [[List of Street Fighter characters #Geki|Geki]] from the original ''Street Fighter'' game, though he is unnamed in the comic) in front of her eyes, revealing to her his shameful occupation. In the present of the comics, he's depicted as a restaurant manager (Revealed to be known as {{nihongo|''Gen Han Ten''|元飯店|Gen's Rice Shop}} in the China stage in Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix), taking care of [[Yun and Yang]] in the stead of their deceased father (in the video games Yun and Yang{{'}}s grandfather is never named) who helps Chun-Li and [[Fei-Long]] discover the whereabouts of a Shadaloo-run Triad compound. He aids the duo in fighting off a legion of criminals led by Xiayu and Yanyu but pushes his body too hard and begins coughing up blood. He reveals to Chun-Li that he is dying of leukemia. Later on, Ryu seeks him out to ask about his encounter with Akuma in preparation for his own battle. Gen tells him that Akuma is the only person who has ever survived his deadliest technique and he chose not to kill him out of pure intrigue. After Ryu leaves, as in the official story, Akuma challenges him to one final match.  Akuma also notes Gen's ill health before the fight, which he admits, before Akuma strikes a killing blow, allowing Gen to die in battle as he wished to. After honoring one another, Akuma leaves. Gen then collapses and dies, his body discovered by the twins. Gen also appears in an important role in [[Masahiko Nakahira]]'s ''Sakura Ganbaru!'' manga. In the storyline, Gen appears in his established assassin role, and is sought by Interpol agent Chun-Li, who is utterly defeated by him. Gen is also engaged by [[Sakura Kasugano]], who he also defeats effortlessly. Gen appeared as one of the main characters the live-action movie, ''[[Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li]]'', portrayed by [[Robin Shou]]. Depicted as a younger martial arts master, he serves as the leader of a secret anti-crime organization known as the Order of the Web. It is Gen who teaches Chun-Li her more advanced moves, including the Kikoken, and accompanies her in the fight against [[M. Bison]] and Shadaloo. His back-story also reveals he was a partner-in-arms with M. Bison in their earlier days as criminals, but Gen eventually left him, no longer tolerant of stealing from others. He was mentioned by [[Gouken]] in ''[[Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist]]'' second episode &quot;Round 1: Fight&quot; as a kung-fu master he met during his Musha Shugyo who taught him how to use the Power of Nothingness as the foundation of his Ansatsuken art instead of the Satsui no Hado.

==Reception==
[[IGN]] ranked Gen at number eighteen in their &quot;Top 25 Street Fighter Characters&quot; article, stating &quot;he represents an ever-reliable character type, made famous by dozens of kung fu movies – he's the old, decrepit, seemingly-crippled senior citizen who can still kick your ass blindfolded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 25 Street Fighter Characters |work=[[IGN]] |date=2008-08-06 |url=http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/895/895023p43.html |accessdate=2015-03-14 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ranked 20th on the list of top ''Street Fighter'' characters by [[UGO.com]], stating &quot;Gen is a master of multiple forms of martial arts, and Capcom gave him the ability to switch stances and abilities in battle, and uncommon trait in any Street Fighter game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 50 Street Fighter Characters |work=[[UGO.com]] |date=2010-08-25 |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/top-50-street-fighter-characters?page=4 |accessdate=2015-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225044501/http://www.ugo.com/games/top-50-street-fighter-characters?page=4 |archivedate=December 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] ranked Gen as the  &quot;21st best Street Fighter character&quot; commenting &quot;Old but dangerous, Gen is lethal up close and unpredictable from a distance. He also has ties to Chun-Li's backstory, so he even enriches the SF universe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/08/best-street-fighter-history/gen|title=&quot;Street Fighter&quot;: The Best Warriors in the History of the Series|publisher=Complex|date=2013-08-13|accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now Gamer listed Gen and [[Heihachi Mishima]] as one of the rivalries they want to see in ''Street Fighter X Tekken'', adding &quot;We’d probably award the round to frail Gen for his multiple fighting styles, as Heihachi loses credibility for his hip-busting forward flip attack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/895299/street_fighter_x_tekken_character_wishlist.html |title=Street Fighter X Tekken Character Wishlist |publisher=NowGamer |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[GamesRadar]] article by Michael Grimm, a fight between Gen and [[List of Tekken characters #Wang Jinrei|Wang Jinrei]] was written as one of the ones players wanted to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, adding &quot;Rumble in the retirement home!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/12-matchups-we-want-to-see-in-street-fighter-x-tekken/?page=2|title=12 matchups we want to see in Street Fighter X Tekken|publisher=GamesRadar|date=2010-08-03|accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2015, Gamer Headlines ranked Gen as the &quot;9th top over 50 video game character in gaming&quot;, stating &quot;Gen lands here at number 9 because while he is a difficult character to master, a skilled Gen player is great to watch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerheadlines.com/2015/03/top-10-50-video-game-characters-gaming/|title=Top 10 Over 50 Video Game Characters in Gaming|publisher=Gamer Headlines|date=2015-03-13|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Screen Rant named Gen the &quot;8th Most Powerful Street Fighter Character&quot;, commenting &quot;he’s one of the few to survive Akuma’s Raging Demon technique, which is a clear indicator of the power Gen has despite his age and failing health. If he lives long enough, who knows what levels his power could reach?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/most-powerful-street-fighter-characters/|title=12 Most Powerful Street Fighter Characters|publisher=Screen Rant|date=2016-04-18|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their rankings of Street Fighter characters, [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] placed Gen at 41st place, where they commented &quot;Gen is a mastermind fighter who can still fight long after most people would have counted him out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/ranking-every-street-fighter-character-part-3.html|title=Ranking Every Street Fighter Character Part 3|publisher=Paste Magazine|date=2016-03-21|accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Den of Geek ranked Gen as the &quot;34th Best Street Fighter Character&quot;, citing his character and concluding &quot;his resolve to stay alive just so he can see how the Ryu/Akuma stuff plays out in the end is pretty rocking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/street-fighter/252283/street-fighter-ranking-all-the-characters/page/0/3|title=Street Fighter: Ranking All the Characters|publisher=Den of Geek|date=2016-07-17|accessdate=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genaro Ruiz Camacho, Jr.''' (September 14, 1954 &amp;ndash; August 26, 1998), aka '''Geno Camacho''', was a [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] dealer and organized crime leader in [[Texas]] who was linked to five murders and eventually executed by the state of Texas.

On May 20, 1988, David L. Wilburn, 25, unwittingly interfered when Camacho and two accomplices tried to kidnap Sam Wright, 57, Evellyn Banks, 31, and Banks's 3-year-old son Andre. Wilburn was shot in the back of the head. After the murder, Wright managed to escape, but Camacho and his accomplices kidnapped Evellyn and Andre Banks and killed them three days later. After this, he fled to [[Mexico]].

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] learned via an informant that Camacho had escaped to the town of [[Arcelia]], in [[Guerrero|Guerrero State]], Mexico.  They requested that he be [[Extradition|extradited]] to the [[United States]], but the Mexican authorities claimed that Arcelia and the surrounding area were under the total control of heavily armed [[drug lord]]s, and that any arrest attempt would result in a bloodbath. Instead, the FBI set up a sting operation to lure Camacho back to the United States. Camacho was arrested as he crossed the [[United States–Mexico border|border]] near [[McAllen, Texas]].  He was convicted of the murder of Wilburn and the kidnapping and murder of Evellyn and Andre Banks, and sentenced to death.Camacho leaves behind daughter,

Camacho had a [[last meal]] of steak, baked potato, salad, and strawberry ice cream, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] on August 26, 1998. The execution had to be delayed by two hours, because of difficulties locating a suitable [[vein]] for the injection.

{{nihongo|'''Gendo Ikari'''|碇 ゲンドウ|Ikari Gendō}} is a fictional character in the ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' franchise. He is the commander of NERV. While all of the English versions romanize his given name as ''Gendo'', [[Gainax]]'s website romanizes it ''Gendoh'', and some fansites romanize his name as &quot;Gendou&quot;.

During Takaaki Mitsuhashi's 2010 campaign for the [[House of Councillors]], he [[cosplay]]ed as Gendo Ikari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-06-06/politician-cosplays-as-evangelion-gendo-for-election Politician Cosplays as Evangelion's Gendō for Election]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In NERV, Gendo is responsible for the research done on the [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion Project]] and the Human Instrumentality Project. He is the father of the Third Child, [[Shinji Ikari]]. At the start of the series, [[Rei Ayanami]] only reliably interacts with him.

Gendo is a brilliant scientist and politician who works diligently for his organization; however, he is an extremely callous person and a cold and distant father towards his son, and has no qualms about using and discarding people to achieve his goals: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Gendo is the type of person who can see &amp; think about the welfare of an organization as a whole. In other words, he'd do anything to succeed. He takes drastic and extreme measures, by fair means or foul, or by hook or by crook, in order to accomplish his own purpose. In some ways he's mean, he hardly cares about Shinji.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;from Hideaki Anno's Anime Expo '96 interview, pp20-3 in the November 1996 ''[[Newtype]]'', as translated by Miyako Graham in issue 43, pages 40-41 of ''[[Protoculture Addicts]]'' and as quoted by Lawrence Eng [http://www.evaotaku.com/omake/anno.html]&lt;!-- Just to clear things up here: Anno was interviewed at the expo, the interview was published in Newtype, the Newtype publication was translated and published in PA, and then I copied over excerpts of the PA article from Eng's page and some mailing lists--&gt;[http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2004-December/002034.html][http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2004-December/002032.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
His last lines in ''The End of Evangelion'' reveal his regret and the true motivations for his ruthless behavior. He intended to use Third Impact to become godlike and create a better future for humanity together with his wife [[Yui Ikari]], whom he intended to rejoin at the conclusion of Instrumentality. However, when Rei defies him he realizes that his efforts are in vain and that he ignored the real wishes of Yui. She intended to bring about a brighter future for their son Shinji, whom Gendo has sacrificed in order to bring her back. In essence, Yui's dreams and principles were violated to resurrect her. He was also afraid that his love for Shinji would instead hurt him and therefore distance himself from him. Shortly after, in the [[Surrealism|surreal]] sequence [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit 01 (Shogōki: 初号機)|Unit 01]] is shown grasping Gendo in its hand before decapitating him. The camera then shows Gendo's lower body still standing with his upper torso severed.

In the new Rebuild of Evangelion franchise his overall role and actions (at least concerning the first film) have remained consistent.

==Background==
Born '''Gendo Rokubungi''' ([[w:ja:六分儀|六分儀]], meaning [[sextant]]), virtually nothing is known about his childhood or young adulthood. During his study at university, he meets two people: Yui Ikari, with whom he started a relationship, and Professor [[List of characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Deputy Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki|Kozo Fuyutsuki]], with whom he becomes friends. Gendo and Yui are married at the beginning of the 21st Century, wherein he changes his surname to Ikari. In 2001, the year after the Second Impact, their son [[Shinji Ikari|Shinji]] is born.

Gendo and Yui work together at the research organization GEHIRN. After the failed activation test of Unit 01 and Yui's apparent death during this event, Gendo becomes very cold and abandons Shinji. Gendo enters into affairs with both [[List of characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Naoko Akagi|Naoko Akagi]] and, later, her daughter [[Ritsuko Akagi|Ritsuko]], seemingly casting doubt on his commitment to Yui; however, it is implied that Gendo was simply using them to achieve the means to accomplish Third Impact. GEHIRN is reorganized to become NERV, of which Gendo becomes Commander. He also comes into contact with SEELE and started to help them with their plans for the Third Impact.

A massive malfunction during the first activation test for [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit 00 (Zerogōki: 零号機)|Unit 00]] causes the Eva to go &quot;berserk.&quot; To prevent Rei from being seriously injured, the entry plug was ejected, and Gendo pried the plug's superheated door open with his bare hands to extract Rei. His hands have severe scarring because of this and he is never shown without gloves (except in [[Rei I|episode 5]], when he briefly takes them off; when Shinji sees they are burned, Ritsuko tells him the story).

Although Gendo pretends to follow SEELE's orders without question, he has his own agenda and tries to out-manipulate the committee. His final outspoken rebellion towards SEELE comes from his desire to initiate Third Impact under his complete control. He implants Adam's embryo in his hand and tries to merge with Rei to achieve this purpose.

In ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'', Rei finally defies Gendo forwardly and separates with him (after absorbing Adam) to merge with Lilith and start Instrumentality on her own. Seeing that all his plans to be reunited with Yui have come to nothing, Gendo begs Rei to return to him; she refuses. After Instrumentality is started, Gendo confronts specters of the various Reis as well as [[Kaworu Nagisa|Kaworu]] and Yui herself. Gendo confesses that he is afraid of the &quot;invisible bonds&quot; formed by those around him, and that he was afraid to confront his son after Yui's death. A vision of Unit 01, with much of its armor missing is seen holding Gendo in much the same manner as Kaworu in [[The Beginning and the End, or &quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot;|Episode 24]]; the real Unit 01 is at that moment within the Tree of Life, and still fully armored. Gendo states that &quot;...this is my retribution&quot;, and the spectral Unit 01 bites off his torso as he utters his final words: &quot;Forgive me, Shinji.&quot; The camera then shifts back to Terminal Dogma, where the lower half of Gendo's body is seen, still standing, with his torso severed.

==Appearances==

===Manga adaptation===
Gendo's role and overall character in the manga is pretty much the same, with only a few differences. Gendo is shown to be even more antagonistic towards Shinji than in the anime, first shown when he calls his son a coward when he refuses to pilot the Eva. Later, while Shinji is recovering, Gendo checks on Rei in the hospital with Shinji watching them and even makes eye contact with him, though other than this he doesn't acknowledge him.

After the battle against [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Bardiel|Bardiel]], where the pilot of Unit 03, Toji is killed, he calls [[Ryōji Kaji|Kaji]] and tells him to bring Shinji to him. Gendo reads off the list of criminal charges, acquired by Shinji who asks his father if he has nothing to say to him, which Gendo corresponds, causing Shinji to respond by trying to punch him. While held by Kaji, Shinji literally begins to scream at his father, telling him that he never wants to see him again. Gendo's response to this is the same as in the anime, to have Shinji removed from NERV's records. When [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Zeruel|Zeruel]] attacks, after Rei fails to activate Unit 01, he heads down to the cage to try to get the Dummy System to work, which proves to be futile. Gendo, in his first act of distress, frantically asks why Unit 01 (and by extension, Yui) is rejecting him, to which Shinji's picture appears on the screens, genuinely surprising Gendo, which is only furthered by his son's reappearance at the cage.

Just as in the anime, SEELE begin to have serious doubts about both Gendo's motives and loyalty after Unit 01 absorbs Zeruel's S² Engine. This results in them sending Kaworu Nagisa in order to keep an eye on him. During Shinji's time in Evangelion Unit 01, he imagines himself killing Gendo. Afterwards, Gendo once again continues to follow the anime adaption, through his defiances of SEELE, while he continues to further his plan to take control of the Human Instrumentality Project. He later swallows Adam instead having it grafted to his hand. Additionally, Adam later appears on his left hand, not the right.

During the Invasion of NERV, he saves Shinji from being killed by JSSDF soldiers by projecting an AT Field from his left hand, which now has Adam embedded within. Gendo also reveals the extent of his madness with his plans to use Third Impact to become God and asks his son to pilot Unit-01 once again to aid in his plans, since after all Shinji has experienced he can now understand Gendo. He covers Shinji and Misato's escape to Unit-01's hangar, certain that Shinji will do as he is told.

Like in the anime, Ritsuko tries to stop Gendo but fails due to the Magi system rejecting her command. Gendo shoots Ritsuko fatally and tries to merge with Rei who however, remembering Shinji rejects Gendo by severing his hand instead of his arm and absorbs Adam and merges with Lilith on her own. However, instead of Rei ripping him in half, Ritsuko (Who survived the gunshot) is able to shoot him in the throat. He falls to the ground on his knees shortly after. While he is dying, he is visited by Yui. Gendo asks if this is his punishment for causing Shinji so much pain. Yui explains that Shinji will be the one to decide the future of the world and tells Gendo the reason why they met was to bring Shinji into the world. Yui then explains that she remained inside Eva-01 to protect Shinji, and that Gendo has violated that purpose. Gendo realizes he has really never loved Shinji and Yui asks him to remember the first time he met his son. He then has another vision about the first time he met Shinji and the first time he felt love for his son. He dies finally understanding Yui's intentions.

===Rebuild of Evangelion===
Gendo's relationship towards his son takes more central focus in Rebuild than in the TV series, with a different story.  Unlike in the original series, Gendo is shown to be less antagonistic to his son, willing to spend if a little time with him as per Rei's request. However, this warmer interaction is completely undone by ''[[Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo]]'', in which Gendo, who wears a visor that hides his eyes at all times, coldly manipulates Shinji and Kaworu into causing the Fourth Impact.

===Shinji Ikari Raising Project===
In the manga adaptation of [[Shinji Ikari Raising Project|the game]], Gendo is shown in a humorous light, much unlike his anime counterpart. His antics, often embarrassing for Shinji, frequently end with him being hit by Yui. During a blackout at NERV, he shined his torch in a scary way, which promptly earned him a smack from Yui. Another time, Gendo is reading a newspaper when Yui asks him if he told Shinji something (like she told Gendo to do). Gendo's response was to sweat and shake nervously and the scene ends with the sound effect of Yui hitting Gendo. Gendo is also shown to be a rather charismatic figure during this time, moving several members of NERV staff (notably all male) to aid with the &quot;pedaling for power&quot; plan.

Also, the perceived &quot;father-son rivalry&quot; between Gendo and Shinji in [[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Evangelion]] fandom is parodied here, as both men decided to &quot;compete&quot; to see who could pedal the fastest. The contest was actually a way to generate electricity for NERV HQ, which had been hit by a blackout. The incident also pays homage to the original anime, where Gendo helps in the manual launching of the EVAs against the invading Angel. Interestingly, both Fuyutsuki and Rei were shown to put in their share of work before dropping out due to fatigue.

==Character notes==
Gendo's last names (Rokubungi and Ikari) mean &quot;sextant&quot; and &quot;anchor&quot; in Japanese, respectively; his first name was taken from another anime project prior to ''Evangelion'' that was aborted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Evangelion'' character names | work=Translation of essay by [[Hideaki Anno]] about character name origins; includes a link to the original essay in Japanese | url=http://www.evacommentary.org/appendix/character-names.html | accessdate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]] has admitted inspiration from the British television show [[UFO (TV series)|UFO]] for the design of Gendo's uniform, specifically that worn by [[UFO (TV series)#Commander Edward Straker|Commander Edward Straker]] (with Fuyutsuki's based on [[Alec Freeman|Col.

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Nicolas Demay was disappointed that although Gendo was portrayed as being a &quot;normal&quot; father in the alternate universe shown in episode 26, that in ''[[Angelic Days]]'', Gendo's portrayal returns to that of a &quot;heartless taciturn&quot; man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetebd.com/BD/manga-Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-The-Iron-Maiden-2nd-4974.html |title=Neon-Genesis Evangelion The Iron Maiden 2nd T1, manga chez Glénat de Khara, Gainax, Hayashi |publisher=Planetebd.com |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zac Bertschy has described Gendo as being &quot;a giant douchebag&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/evangelion-1.0-you-are-not-alone&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Jones described Gendo as having an &quot;'I want to be God' complex&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=761 |title=THEM Anime Reviews 4.0 - Neon Genesis Evangelion |publisher=Themanime.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genene Jones''' (born July 13, 1950) is a former [[pediatric]] nurse who killed somewhere between 6 and over 60 infants and children in her care. She used injections of  [[digoxin]], [[heparin]] and later [[succinylcholine]] to [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy|induce medical crises in her patients]], with the intention of reviving them afterward in order to receive praise and attention. Many children did not survive the initial attack. The exact number of murders remains unknown, as hospital officials allegedly first misplaced then destroyed records of her activities to prevent further litigation after Jones' first conviction.

==Early life==
Jones was adopted by a nightclub owner and his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spotlight&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Personality Spotlight;NEWLN:Nurse Genene: Convicted murderer|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/02/15/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNNurse-Genene-Convicted-murderer/6881445669200/|accessdate=March 27, 2016|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=February 15, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones worked as a beautician before attending nursing school in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trial&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Teresa|title=Nurse Genene faces trial in children's hospital deaths|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/01/14/Nurse-Genene-faces-trial-in-childrens-hospital-deaths/9819442904400/|accessdate=March 27, 2016|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=January 14, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESK&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|date=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=0816069875|pages=138-139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139|accessdate=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career and background==
While Jones worked as a [[licensed practical nurse|licensed vocational nurse]] at the Bexar County Hospital (now [[University Health System|University Hospital of San Antonio]]) in the [[pediatric intensive care unit]], a statistically inordinate number of children died under her care. Because the hospital feared being sued, it simply asked all of its LVNs, including Jones, to resign and staffed the pediatric ICU exclusively with [[registered nurse]]s. No further investigation was pursued by the hospital.

She then took a position at a pediatric physician's clinic in Kerrville, Texas, near San Antonio. It was here that she was charged with poisoning six children. The doctor in the office discovered puncture marks in a bottle of succinylcholine in the drug storage, where only she and Jones had access. Contents of the apparently full bottle were later found to be diluted. Succinylcholine is a powerful paralytic that causes temporary paralysis of all skeletal muscles, as well as those that control breathing.  A patient cannot breathe while under the influence of this drug. In small children, cardiac arrest is the ultimate result of deoxygenation due to lack of respiration. 

Jones claimed she was trying to stimulate the creation of a pediatric intensive care unit in Kerrville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hickey&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Eric | last=Hickey | title=Serial Murderers and Their Victims (5th edition) | publisher=[[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth]] | location=Belmont, CA | year=2010 | page=182 |isbn=978-0-495-60081-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes &amp; Holmes&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1=Ronald | last1=Holmes | first2= Stephen | last2=Holmes | title=Contemporary Perspectives on Serial Murder | publisher=[[Sage Publications]] | location=Thousand Oaks, CA | year=1998 | page=42 |isbn=978-0-7619-1421-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Jones was married to her high school sweetheart between 1968 and 1974, and they had one child during that time. They later reconciled and had another child together in 1977.&lt;ref name=Spotlight/&gt; Just before her indictment, Jones married a 19-year-old nursing assistant. He filed for divorce a short time later.&lt;ref name=Trial/&gt;

==Sentence==
In 1985, Jones was sentenced to 99 years in prison for killing 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan with succinylcholine. Later that year, she was sentenced to a concurrent term of 60 years in prison for nearly killing Rolando Santos with heparin. 

As of May 2016, Jones is held at the [[Lane Murray Unit]] of the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]].&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;[https://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=03193016 Genene].

==Media==
She was portrayed by [[Susan Ruttan]] in the television movie ''[[Deadly Medicine]]'' (1991) and by Alicia Bartya in the straight-to-video movie ''Mass Murder'' (2002). She was also featured in a [[Discovery Channel]] [[documentary film|documentary]], ''Lethal Injection,'' season five of [[Forensic Files]] entitled &quot;Nursery Crimes&quot; as well as the &quot;Dark Secrets&quot; episode of Investigation Discovery's ''Deadly Women,'' and was said to have inspired [[Annie Wilkes]] from [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]''.

'''The General''' ('''Ulysses Hadrian Armstrong''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Chuck Dixon]]  as an opponent for [[Batman]], the character first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #654, published in December 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 654&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Chuck Dixon]] | Penciller = [[Michael Netzer]] | Inker = [[Scott Hanna]] | Letters = Willie Schubert | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = God of Battle | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 654 | Date = Dec, 1992 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Named for the character's [[gimmick]] for [[military strategy]] and prowess with [[small arms]], stories involving the character often include [[Military history|historic military references]] and themes.

Initially portrayed as a dangerously [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]], murderous [[Adolescence|adolescent]], the tone of the General was changed by Dixon himself for later appearances. Return appearances featured the character in issues of ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' during the mid-1990s, in which Dixon portrayed the character as pompous and childish, rather than maliciously insane. Though still occasionally dangerous and lethal, the [[graphic violence]] of the character's criminal behavior was also toned down.

The character experienced a prolonged period of obscurity after 1997, lasting over ten years, until [[Fabian Nicieza]] chose to revamp the character for the concluding [[story arc]] of the ''Robin'' comic book series in the final months of 2008. With Nicieza's intention being to establish the character as an [[archenemy]] for [[Tim Drake]], the General was once again characterized as a major threat in the [[List of Batman Family enemies|&quot;Batman Family&quot; pantheon of villains]]. Recast as a new version of another obscure character, [[Anarky]], Armstrong was also re-characterized with a new &quot;Anarky&quot; themed costume.

===Creation and first appearance===
The General was created by Chuck Dixon in 1992.
Ulysses Hadrian Armstrong is a [[psychosis|psychotic]] child with the mind of a military [[genius]]. Bored with his life at a [[military school]], he reads books about military history. Ulysses later escapes his school, burning down the school and killing everyone inside, acts of [[arson]] and [[mass murder]], to avoid alerting authorities to his escape. He goes to [[Gotham City]] to recruit small-time gang members into a makeshift &quot;army&quot;.  Utilizing military skills, Armstrong's reputation gains him the nickname &quot;the General&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 654&quot;/&gt; Continuing a campaign to become a powerful [[crime boss]] of Gotham, the General conquers and absorbs enemy gangs into a sizable force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 655&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Michael Netzer | Inker = Scott Hanna | Letters = Willie Schubert | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = The Anvil of War | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 655 | Date = Jan, 1993 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laying siege to a police station with the intent of capturing the storage room full of guns and illegal drugs, with which to fund future activities, he is confronted by Batman. Once captured by Batman, the General's undisciplined army scatters in fear, and the General himself is sent to a [[youth detention center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 656&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Tom Mandrake | Inker = Scott Hanna | Letters = John Costanza | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = Besieged | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = | Issue = 656 | Date = Feb, 1993 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid 1990s appearances in ''Robin''===
Between 1995 and 1997, the General appeared in a total of three story arcs in issues of the ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' comic book series.

The General manipulated delusional homeless derelict, Julie Caesar, who believed himself to be the historical [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 19&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = [[Staz Johnson]] | Inker = [[Bob Smith (comics)|Bob Smith]] | Letters = Tim Harkins | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = War Gods in the 'Hood | Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 19 | Date = Aug, 1995 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 20&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Staz Johnson | Inker = Bob Smith | Letters = Tim Harkins | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = The Empire Strikes Out | Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 20 | Date = Sep, 1995 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General teamed up with [[Toyman]], but this partnership ended in mutual betrayal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 36&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Staz Johnson | Inker = Bob Smith | Letters = Tim Harkins | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = War Toy Story| Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 36 | Date = Dec, 1996 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 37&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Staz Johnson | Inker = Bob Smith | Letters = Tim Harkins | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = Who Dies With The Most Toys| Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 37 | Date = Jan, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General was given control as commander-in-chief of a country's military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 44&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Staz Johnson | Inker = Bob Smith | Letters = Tim Harkins | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = The Stupid Death| Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 44 | Date = Aug, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 45&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Staz Johnson | Inker = Bob Smith | Letters = Tim Harkins | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = Grounded| Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 45 | Date = Sep, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 47&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Eduardo Barreto | Inker = Bob Smith | Letters = Tim Harkins | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = War Child, Chapter 1: The Prepubescent and The Dead| Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 47 | Date = Nov, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 48&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Penciller = Eduardo Barreto | Inker = Bob Smith | Letters = Tim Harkins | colors = Adrienna Roy | Story = Mission Creep| Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 48 | Date = Dec, 1997 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 revamp as &quot;Anarky&quot;===
[[Image:Anarky - Robin no.182.jpg|thumb|The costume design for the new Ulysses H. Armstrong version of [[Anarky]], as depicted on promotional art for ''Robin'' #182, part of the &quot;[[Faces of Evil]]&quot; event. Art by [[Brian Stelfreeze]].]]
The General appeared at the end of 2008 in ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' #177, &quot;Search for a Hero&quot; storyline that deals with the [[Batman R.I.P.]] aftermath, ''[[Battle for the Cowl]]''. Within the storyline, he is revealed to disguised as [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]].

After a very long absence, the General has returned to [[Gotham City]], having aged several years, grown several feet and has become a more formidable hand-to-hand combatant.  He physically appears closer in age to Robin and Spoiler.  He has for reasons yet unknown been hired by [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Spoiler]] to gather information about the Gang Wars, and find a possible solution to them. He continues to hold a grudge against Robin and betrays Spoiler. Spoiler survives a gunshot to the shoulder, and then distracts him long enough to get the drop on him and escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 177&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Fabian Nicieza]] | artist = [[Freddy Williams II]] | Colors = Guy Major | Letterer = John J. Hill | Story = Search for a Hero: The Concrete Cauldron | Title = Robin | Volume = 1 | Issue = 177 | Date = Aug 20, 2008 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 178&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Fabian Nicieza | artist = Freddy Williams II | Colors = Guy Major | Letterer = John J. Hill | Story = Search for a Hero: Life During Wartime | Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 178 | Date = Sep 17, 2008 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 179&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Fabian Nicieza | artist = Freddy Williams II | Colors = Guy Major | Letterer = John J. Hill | Story = Search for a Hero: Chaos in a Bottle | Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 179 | Date = Oct 22, 2008 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill | Story = Search for a Hero: Gray Knights | Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 180 | Date = Nov 19, 2008 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He comes into possession of the [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]] costume worn by [[Jason Todd]], and uses it as part of a campaign of psychological warfare against [[Tim Drake]]. More formidable than ever, he's revealed to be holding [[Anarky|Lonnie Machin]] hostage and to have commandeered the latter's identity as Anarky. Where Machin's approach as Anarky had been to cause social change, Armstrong's approach bordered more on psychotic and meaningless acts of chaos and destruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 181&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Fabian Nicieza | artist = Freddy Williams II | Colors = Guy Major | Letterer = John J. Hill | Story = Search for a Hero: Pushing Buttons, Pulling Strings | Title = Robin | Volume = 2 | Issue = 181 | Date = Dec 17, 2008 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong manages to catch Robin in his warehouse, yet Robin escapes through unknown means, but not without sustaining serious burns to his head.  Soon after, a final confrontation ensues, where Anarky attempts to kill all of Gotham City's Gangs, so as to create more violence. The combined efforts of Robin, Spoiler, Commissioner Gordon, Officer Harper and the Gotham Gangs results in Armstrong's defeat.  However, not without a price.  In order to take the edge off of Armstrong, Robin asked Officer Harper to bring the Armstrong Family to confront Ulysses. While the action worked, Armstrong caused a bomb to explode, killing his brother and sister in the blast. Armstrong blames Robin for their deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 182&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Fabian Nicieza | artist = Freddy Williams II | Colors = Guy Major | Letterer = John J.

===Rebirth===
Ulysses returns to continuity after Flashpoint during the Detective Comics storyline &quot;Rise of the Batmen&quot;, a part of DC's Rebirth relaunch. This version of the character is a teenage genius who works for a military organization known as The Colony, which models itself after Batman and his methods. Ulysses' job within the Colony is to reverse engineer Batman's equipment, as well as observe the Bat-Family. This version of the character is shown to be cheerful yet sociopathic, gleefully offering to show Batman footage of the more gruesome missions that the Colony has undertaken. &lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 937&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = James Tynion IV | artist = Alvaro Martinez | Colors = Brad Anderson and Adriano Lucas | Story = Rise of the Batmen | Title = Detective Comics | Volume = 1 | Issue = 937 | Date = Jul 27, 2016 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills and resources==
{{Expand section|notable examples from primary sources, commentary from authors and critics, and additional citations|date=November 2009}} 
;Military strategy and deception
The General is a military and strategic genius. He has vast knowledge of [[military history]], and his careful planning are what earned him the respect of his henchmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 654&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 655&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 656&quot;/&gt; Sometimes he fools adults into false senses of security in order to attack them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 19&quot;/&gt; Sometimes he tricks adults into letting him control armies&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 48&quot;/&gt;

;Armed and unarmed combat
Growing up, he gains a muscular build and a lesser degree of [[martial arts]] knowledge, not nearly enough to best seasoned fighters like [[Tim Drake|Robin]], but quite formidable nevertheless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 180&quot;/&gt;

He retains his penchant for historical weapons, and in his brief stint as the ''Red Robin'' he's shown using a [[Mauser]] as his sidearm of preference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 181&quot;/&gt;

;Costumes
He likes to play dress up, changing several costumes and identities in his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics 654&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 48&quot;/&gt; Starting from a simple ''military themed'' garb, he then adopted the ''Red Robin'' suit,&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 180&quot;/&gt;  discarded from a [[Countdown to Final Crisis|dimension hopping]] [[Jason Todd]], using the Bat-Family themed identity to pave off for his return as the new Anarchy.

As Anarchy he uses a modified version of the original Anarky suit, adapted to fit his broader and sturdier physical build and with an ''angrier'' mask &lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 182&quot;/&gt;

;Explosives expertise
Both as Red Robin, both as Anarky, Adrian is shown able to create and set complex explosive traps, drawing Tim Drake in a mined warehouse and managing to wound him seriously. As Anarky he wears a special cane with remote controller trigger, making him able to detonate explosives carefully hidden through the battlefield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 181&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 182&quot;/&gt;

==Other versions==
*''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' #55-57, set in the near-future, features an adult Ulysses Armstrong as one of a number of crime bosses contacted by Vigil, Inc., a corrupt private police force which is actually a [[protection racket]] for criminals. This adult version of the General wears modern military gear, rather than the historic costumes of his younger self, and surrounds himself with women who have general's stars tattooed on their foreheads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman: LotDK 55&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Artist = [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] | Letters = Willie Schubert | Story = Watchtower | Title = Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight | Volume = | Issue = 55 | Date = Dec, 1993 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman: LotDK 56&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Artist = Mike McMahon | Letters = Willie Schubert | Story = Watchtower | Title = Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight | Volume = | Issue = 56 | Date = Jan, 1994 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman: LotDK 57&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Chuck Dixon | Artist = Mike McMahon | Letters = Willie Schubert | Story = Watchtower | Title = Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight | Volume = | Issue = 57 | Date = Feb, 1994 | Publisher = DC Comics | location=New York City, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General Grievous''' is a fictional character in the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' franchise]]. A recurring antagonist, he is the Supreme Commander of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] against the [[Galactic Republic]] and is trained in all [[lightsaber]] combat forms to ensure the  [[Jedi]]'s destruction.

The character was originally introduced in 2004 in the animated series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', before being part of the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]''.

==Appearances==

===Film===

===''Revenge of the Sith''===
In ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', General Grievous is depicted as the secondary antagonist. He holds Supreme Chancellor Palpatine hostage aboard his flagship ''[[Trade Federation Cruiser|Invisible Hand]]''. After a rescue operation results in [[Count Dooku]]'s death at [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s hands, Grievous captures the fleeing Jedi and the Chancellor in a ray shield, and has them brought along with R2-D2 to the bridge. Grievous takes their lightsabers, cackling that he will add them to his collection, just before R2-D2 creates a distraction by feigning malfunction and Obi Wan uses the Force to retrieve his light saber, allowing him to free Anakin and himself. A short battle ensues with Anakin and Obi-Wan overcoming Grievous's MagnaGuards and other droid minions before turning their attention to him. Grievous escapes by using one of the fallen MagnaGuard's electrostaffs to shatter the glass on the bridge, creating a vacuum that pulls everyone towards space, before firing a grapple-hook from his arm to secure himself to the ship, and scaling its exterior en route to an escape pod. Though the Jedi party manages to avoid being blown out into space, Grievous launches all the pods simultaneously to deny the Jedi means to a safe exit from the ship, then sets his destination for the outer galactic planet of [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]].

Later in the film, Grievous encounters Obi-wan on Utapau, where he is holding the residents hostage. When Obi-wan easily overpowers his MagnaGuards, Grievous engages him on his own, revealing that Dooku trained him in the Jedi arts. He fights with Obi-wan using four different lightsabers, but is eventually disarmed, and flees when Clone troopers arrive to liberate his hostages. Eventually, he was killed by Obi-Wan with Grievous' blaster.

===Television===

====''Clone Wars''====
In ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', General Grievous's first public appearance is when he attacked several Jedi on Hypori. After killing Daakman Barrek, Grievous and his droids surrounded Tarr Seirr, Sha'a Gi, [[Aayla Secura]], K'Kruhk, [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]] and [[Shaak Ti]]. After stating he would grant the Jedi a &quot;warrior's death&quot;, Grievous battled the six Jedi all by himself, killing Seirr, and injuring Secura, Ti, and K'kruhk. He managed to possess three lightsabers (one in each hand and the third using his left foot) to fight Mundi. As they fought, lightsabers blazing, [[clone troopers]] arrived to save the surviving Jedi from Grievous, though they left K'kruhk thinking he was dead.

Sometime later, Grievous searched for [[Palpatine|Supreme Chancellor Palpatine]] on [[Coruscant (Star Wars)|Coruscant]] and fought several Jedi that took Palpatine to a secret bunker aboard a maglev train. However, while the general's Magnaguards distracted the lead Jedi, Grievous reached the hardened bunker, killed two other Jedi and captured Palpatine. As Grievous was about to escape, [[Mace Windu]] [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]-crushed his chest plates, severely injuring him. Although many fans believed this to be the reason for his persisting cough heard in ''Revenge of the Sith'', Grievous was actually intended to have had the cough all along (evidenced by him having the cough from the beginning in the subsequent CGI series ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars''). The confusion arose due to the writers of ''Star Wars: Clone Wars'' having to produce the series before all of Grievous's final characterizations had been nailed down. 

====''The Clone Wars''====
In the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', General Grievous is a recurring major antagonist.
In the first season, Grievous is the commander of the huge Separatist warship ''Malevolence'' armed with a pair of heavy ion cannons. He also clashes with Obi-Wan Kenobi aboard the ''Malevolence'' for the first time when he chases him aboard the warship's railway system. During the ensuing lightsaber duel, Grievous nearly gets the better of Kenobi, but the Jedi Master makes his escape at the last moment. Meanwhile, Anakin secretly sabotages the ''Malevolence''{{'s}} navigation computer, sending it crashing into a nearby moon. However, Grievous escapes on his starfighter and continues his campaign against the Republic. A few episodes later, Grievous discovers Anakin Skywalker and Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]] infiltrating his secret listening post and seeks out to search for them. He then engages Tano and her squad of clone troopers, defeating all the troopers and then engaging in a cat and mouse game with Tano. However, Tano and Skywalker still manage to destroy his listening post. Aware of Grievous's recent string of failures, Count Dooku arranges a test for his cyborg henchman - in the form of Jedi Master [[Kit Fisto]] and Jedi Knight Nahdar Vebb. In Grievous's personal castle on the third moon of Vassek, the two Jedi and a squad of clone troopers ambush Grievous and cut off his legs. Once repaired, Grievous duels and kills Vebb. On the outskirts of Grievous's castle, the general climbs up from the ledge and unleashes four lightsabers on Fisto. Using the fog to his advantage, Fisto successfully cuts off one of Grievous's hands and reclaims Vebb's lightsaber. Armed with two lightsabers, Fisto gains the upper hand over Grievous to which the general calls in his Magnaguards and Fisto flees. When Grievous reports to Dooku, his master informs Grievous that there is room for improvement.

During the second season, Grievous boards a Republic Cruiser with Jedi Master Eeth Koth on board. Grievous duels Koth and takes him prisoner. Kenobi, Skywalker and Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]] attempt to rescue Koth and capture the cyborg general, resulting in a confrontation between the Grievous and Kenobi over the planet Saleucami which Grievous loses. Though the Jedi succeed in rescuing Koth, Grievous, helped by his droids, escapes once again.

In the third season, Grievous, Ventress and their armies attack the clone factories on the planet [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. During the battle, Grievous clashes with Obi-Wan again. However, their duel ends in stalemate and Grievous flees the planet with Ventress. Later on, Grievous commands a sabotage mission using infiltrator droids on the Galactic Senate, resulting in a deregulation of the banks.

During the fourth season, Grievous suffers a humiliating defeat when he attempts to invade [[Naboo]]. [[Jar Jar Binks]] (posing as Gungan Boss Lyonie) distracts Grievous in a series of negotiations long enough for the Gungan Army to shut down Grievous's invasion force. As Grievous pursues Jar Jar, he slaughters many Gungan Grand Army soldiers. At that moment, General Tarpals intervenes and engages Grievous in a duel. Although he is mortally wounded by the cyborg, Tarpals impales Grievous through his chest which allows the Gungan Army to bombard the wounded general with energized projectiles and capture him. However, he is freed in a prisoner exchange with Skywalker between Dooku and [[Padmé Amidala]]. Later, Grievous attacks Gallia's ship, engaging her in a lightsaber duel down a narrow hallway. The duel ends when Grievous kicks Gallia in the chest, sending her flying across the hallway. Grievous then captures Gallia. Shortly after, Gallia escapes Grievous's custody when a strike force led by Jedi Master [[Plo Koon]] boards his ship and frees the Jedi Master, prompting Grievous to flee once again. Grievous is later sent to the planet Dathomir under Dooku's orders to exterminate the Nightsisters. Immediately upon landing on the planet's surface, the general begins his rampage and his droid army turns Dathomir into a battlefield. However, [[Asajj Ventress]] turns the tables on the battle and fights her way to the general's shuttle where the cyborg emerges to confront her personally. As they duel, Grievous grows overconfident and begins to toy with Ventress until she surprises him by chopping off one of his arms and knocking him to the ground. Grievous then orders his troops to fire on Ventress, wounding her. As the general prepares to deliver the deathblow to his longtime rival, he is attacked by Nightsister [[zombie]]s and is forced to fight them off while Ventress flees. Under new orders from Dooku, Grievous turns his attention to Nightsister leader Mother Talzin and slaughters his way to her fortress where she narrowly escapes from the general's grasp by [[teleporting]] away. Grievous is later seen on Serenno listening to Dooku's fears about [[Savage Opress]].

In the fifth season's premiere episode, Grievous is mentioned by [[Hondo Ohnaka]] as having defeated Obi-Wan and won the battle for the system that Florrum is in. This battle is shown in the episode &quot;Bound for Rescue&quot; where Grievous attacks Obi-Wan's ship; the General slaughters a squadron of clones and duels Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan is no match for Grievous and is subsequently defeated, forcing him to abandon his ship. Later, Grievous goes to Florrum personally and announces that the system is under his control now, and that Dooku is having him punish Hondo for holding him for ransom. The droids destroy Hondo's stronghold and his belongings, and hold him prisoner, but Hondo is rescued when Ahsoka and a group of younglings free him and retreat off the planet. Grievous pursues them and fights Ahsoka. Although she has grown stronger since their last battle, Grievous still proves to be more than a match for her. The duel ends when Hondo picks up Ahsoka in the ''Slave I'' and takes off, leaving Grievous to stew in his anger. In the first episode of the droid arc &quot;Secret Weapons&quot;, Grievous is mentioned in the opening credits, and the primary goal of the mission is to retrieve a module that will decode a transmittion that Grievous made about an important Separatist attack.

Grievous was to undergo a design change in the seventh season to look more like his design in Revenge of the Sith. Though the series was cancelled before this could happen, the unfinished animations of the Crystal Crisis arc showed this design. In this arc, Grievous is sent by Dooku to purchase a giant [[kyber crystal]] on Utapau, and while Grievous at first obtains the crystal, it is lost when Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi destroy it by overloading its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/video/star-wars-the-clone-wars-story-reel-a-death-on-utapau|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Story Reel: A Death on Utapau - Star Wars: The Clone Wars|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Star Wars'' literature===
Grievous made his first appearance in the comics in a short story in ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'' called &quot;The Eyes of Revolution&quot;. This story reveals that he was once Kaleesh general '''Qymaen jai Sheelal''', a fierce warrior engaged in a brutal war with the rival planet Huk. Grievous has had many wives. One that he is currently married to is human Gravlyn. He boards a shuttle to take him to another battle, unaware that Dooku had planted an explosive device in it. He is mortally wounded in the resulting crash and what remains of his body is reconstructed with [[cybernetic]] limbs. Dooku then recruits him into the Separatist Army as his second-in-command.

In the third volume of ''[[Clone Wars Adventures]]'', it is revealed that Grievous attains his rank of Supreme Commander by dueling Ventress and Durge simultaneously. On board the Trenchant space station, Ventress and Durge are ordered by Dooku to search for an unknown intruder with the pair unaware of the Count's intentions. Armed with an electrostaff, Grievous appears from behind and electrocutes Durge and subsequently throws him across the hallway through a few trophies. Ventress jumps onto a chandelier and attempts to search for Grievous, but is instead knocked off by the Cyborg but is saved by Durge. The pair then confront the general face to face, with Ventress unleashing her lightsabers and Durge unleashing his full arsenal. Grievous is able to knock Ventress away, though Durge then sends the general flying across the room into a wall with a powerful punch to the face. Enraged, Grievous unleashes his lightsabers, swiftly defeating the pair. In the wake of the battle, Grievous is made the Supreme Commander of the Confederacy's military.

Grievous starred in his own comic called ''Star Wars: General Grievous'', in which he fights Jedi Master T'chooka D'oon and his Padawan Flyn. After Grievous kills D'oon, Kybo returns to the Jedi council with a plan to destroy Grievous once and for all. When the council rebukes his vengeful plan, Kybo decides to take this matter into own hands with disastrous results. Grievous also appears in the comics in ''Star Wars: Obsession'' issue number 4, in which he is on the world of Boz Pity where he kills two Jedi, Master Soon Bayts and Jedi Council member [[Adi Gallia]]. Though Grievous is crippled by Windu, Dooku is able to save him so he may fight another day.

Grievous appears as a major character in the four-part comic series, ''Son of Dathomir'', an unproduced story arc intended for ''Clone Wars'' season six. The cyborg general is sent by Dooku to hunt down the rogue Sith Lord Darth Maul, who has become a significant threat to Sidious's plans. Grievous is ordered to only wound Maul's forces, but not kill him; this is in order to draw out Mother Talzin, who is later revealed to be Maul's blood mother. Though he thinks it foolish to keep Maul alive, Grievous does as he is told. He takes a huge army of droids to Zanbar and attacks Maul's army of Death Watch warriors. Despite heavy casualties, Grievous' droids ultimately win the battle. During the battle, Grievous briefly fights Maul and wins, forcing him to flee. Later, Grievous and Dooku are lured into a trap by Maul and his minions, and are taken prisoner in order to draw out Sidious. However, Grievous soon escapes and rejoins Sidious, who orders Grievous to attack Dathomir again, where Maul and Talzin are planning using Dooku as a sacrifice to restore Talzin to full strength. Sidious fights Talzin while Grievous duels Maul again. Maul eventually overpowers Grievous and Force-pushes him through a wall. Grievous quickly reappears, however, and after Sidious and Dooku have subdued Talzin (who has thrown Maul out of the battle to save his life), Grievous stabs her through the chest with his lightsabers, killing her.

In the novel ''Labyrinth of Evil'', Grievous plans an invasion of Coruscant alongside Dooku and Sidious. He first appears in the novel watching his hated subordinate [[Nute Gunray]] flee from a pursuant Republic Strike Force. Grievous reluctantly saves Gunray by destroying the fighters. Grievous' invasion of the planet Belderone would also be thwarted by Skywalker and Kenobi due to a careless mistake on Gunray's part. Though Gunray resorts to lies, Grievous deduces that the Neimoidian is lying and threatens to kill him. Later on the bridge of the ''Invisible Hand'', Dooku watches as Grievous spars his elite Magnaguards. Though Grievous wins the fight, Dooku points out several flaws in the general's technique while realizing he is partly to blame for the general's inadequacies. Grievous soon launches his invasion on the Republic capital of Coruscant in an attempt to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, placing himself on the battlefield once again. During the invasion, Grievous battles Mace Windu while personally trying to capture Palpatine. Though Windu overwhelms Grievous in combat, the cyborg outwits the Jedi Guard and takes Palpatine hostage.

===Video games===
General Grievous has appeared in the video games ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (video game)|Revenge of the Sith]]'' video game.

Grievous next appears in the video game ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. Following the establishment of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtroopers]] take Grievous' living head, and place it in his body, transforming him to a droid.  This war droid has a brief life in the Myyydril Caverns on [[Kashyyyk]] before being destroyed by an anonymous group of spacers. The combatants loot the droid's remains, taking its weaponry and anything else of value. The facemask ends up on the Invisible Market, where it is purchased for its artistic properties by a high-ranking Imperial admiral &amp;mdash; purported to be none other than [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Star Wars: Galaxies&quot;&gt;''[[Star Wars: Galaxies]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Grievous also makes a very brief appearance in ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'', when Delta Squad almost catches him boarding his starship to an &quot;unknown&quot; planet. Earlier, on Geonosis, after killing Sun Fac, a ship looking similar to Grievous' flies away. The squad notes the ship as not being Geonosian. Grievous makes his next appearance in ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|Lego Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', featured as a boss and an unlockable, playable character in free play mode. He is also playable in free play mode in ''[[Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]'' by accessing a save file of ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|Lego Star Wars]]''.

Grievous appears as a playable character in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Lightsaber Duels]]''. Grievous also appears as a playable character in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron]]''. Unlike ''Star Wars: Battlefront II'', in the DS version, he can use his four arms at the cost of force points instead of just two at the end of an attack.

Grievous is also a boss villain in several mini games of the online game ''Clone Wars Adventures''.

Grievous, as an evil pig, is a playable character in ''[[Angry Birds Star Wars II]]''.

In ''[[Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]'', General Grievous is featured as a boss in story mode and an unlockable, playable character in free play mode.

===In popular culture===
In an episode of ''[[Ace of Cakes]]'', Duff mentions that a surgical robot &quot;looks like General Grievous&quot;.

==Behind the scenes==

===Concept===
General Grievous was developed for ''Revenge of the Sith'' as a powerful new villain on the side of the Separatists. The initial instructions that director [[George Lucas]] gave the Art Department were very open-ended: &quot;a droid general&quot;. From that vague direction, the artists developed a lot of explorations, some purely mechanical, some not, for Grievous' look. He was also created as a villain foreshadowing Anakin Skywalker's transformation into [[Darth Vader]]: the heavy breathing, the [[cyborg]] body, and his seduction into a malevolent faction.

The initial design sketch for Grievous was refined and made into a {{convert|1|ft|cm|sing=on}}-tall [[maquette]] sculpture. That was further refined when it was made into a realistic computer-generated model by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]. At the time, this was one of the most complicated models ever created by ILM, with many parts of differing physical qualities. Grievous is completely [[computer-generated imagery]] in the movie. On set, Duncan Young read the lines off-screen while Kyle Rowling wore a [[chroma key|bluescreen]] or a [[chroma key|greenscreen]] suit to act out the fights with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].

Also notable are the numerous contradictions between the expanded universe and both TV series. Grievous is depicted as having four fingers per arm in the ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' series whereas ''Star Wars: Clone Wars'' has the general depicted as having 5. ''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith'' and most other comics depicted him as having six fingers per arm. While the original ''Clone Wars'' incarnation was fast, acrobatic and powerful, the recent ''The Clone Wars'' incarnation was rather dim and incompetent, though still reasonably swift and strong. Furthermore, his asthmatic cough and hunchbacked stance are already present despite having not gained them prior to his confrontation with Mace Windu. The general's back story has also been changed: supervising director Dave Filoni stated that Grievous opted for surgery in order to gain powers that would allow him to rival a Jedi Knight. This is reinforced by season one's tenth episode &quot;Lair of Grievous&quot; which suggested the general's transformation into a cyborg was a gradual process.

Comparisons have been drawn between the character's appearance and [[Jacob Epstein]]'s sculpture ''[[Rock Drill (Jacob Epstein)|Rock Drill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = I.B.Tauris | isbn = 1845112377

===Movie notes===
General Grievous' [[asthma]]tic cough in ''Revenge of the Sith'' was intended to emphasize his organic nature as well as the flaws of having cyborg [[prosthesis|prosthetics]]. Grievous had previously appeared in ''Clone Wars'' before many of his personality traits had been finalized. To reconcile the differences between the two presentations, [[Mace Windu]] uses the [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]] to crush Grievous' chest panel towards the end of the show's third season (Volume Two) as the general makes a desperate escape with Palpatine. Some of the audio effects for the coughing were taken from Lucas himself, who had had [[bronchitis]] during principal photography.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDcom&quot;&gt;''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith'' DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, John Knoll and Roger Guyett, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayal===
General Grievous has been voiced by four actors. In the ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' animated series, the character was voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] for Season Two's finale episode and by [[Richard McGonagle]] for Season Three. The character was dubbed by [[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]] in the feature film ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', the animated series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and most of the video game appearances. David W. Collins voiced the character, albeit uncredited, in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron]]''.

[[Gary Oldman]] (a friend of producer [[Rick McCallum]]) agreed to submit a voice audition but his involvement never went beyond that. Several months later, actor [[John Rhys-Davies]] was widely reported to be the character's voice but this was eventually revealed to be a prank.

'''General Zahl''' is the name of a [[DC Comics]] supervillain.

==Publication history==
General Zahl first appeared in ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' #121 and was created by [[Bruno Premiani]] and [[Murray Boltinoff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = General Zahl | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 136 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
General Zahl is a former [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[U-boat]] captain who tangled from time to time with the [[Doom Patrol]], originally as &quot;Captain Zahl.&quot;

As a U-boat captain, Zahl was ruthless and effective, achieving the highest kill number of any commander in the [[Kriegsmarine|German fleet]]. After the fall of the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], Captain Zahl worked as a mercenary, until a conflict with the Doom Patrol forced him into retirement. Due to the conflict, he was forced to wear a neck and back brace. Later, Zahl (now calling himself &quot;General Zahl&quot;) assisted [[Madame Rouge]] in apparently killing the Doom Patrol. Madame Rouge had previously succeeded (also apparently) in destroying the other members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

Years later, [[Beast Boy|Changeling]], [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Robotman]] and the [[Teen Titans]] tracked down Zahl and Rouge. Near the conflict's end, Zahl, determined to not be taken alive, fired upon Robotman, knowing the bullets would ricochet and strike Zahl, which they did. As Zahl lay dying, he declared &quot;I die now, but that is all right. I haff the last laugh, Robotman!&quot; Unrepentant to the end, his final words were &quot;[[Heil Hitler|Hei...Heil Hitl...]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Zahl is a skilled military commander and soldier, but has no superhuman powers.  The character General Skarr, who was originally featured on ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'' and is now a supporting character on ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', bears many resemblances to Zahl.

==In other media==
===Television===
* General Zahl appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode &quot;The Last Patrol!&quot; voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. In a documentary about the Doom Patrol, it is mentioned that he fought the Doom Patrol in France with his defeat being the last time anyone has seen the Doom Patrol. Years later, General Zahl assembles [[Brain (comics)|Brain]], [[Monsieur Mallah]], [[Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man]], Mutant Master, and Arsenal into targeting the Doom Patrol members. After Arsenal was defeated, General Zahl arrived in a ship and attacked Batman and the Doom Patrol with knock-out gas. Some minutes later on General Zahl's ship, General Zahl had Chief mention the real reason why the Doom Patrol broke up. It turned out that back in the Doom Patrol's last fight with General Zahl in France, General Zahl held a woman at gunpoint. Though General Zahl was defeated, the woman was killed. Now General Zahl reveals that he had planted two detonators on two nearby islands with the Doom Patrol deciding on which island to save with the choice being televised around the world. When Batman breaks free enough for the Doom Patrol to escape, General Zahl assembles the villains he had gathered. When General Zahl mentions that the actual detonator control is on his hat and activates it, the Doom Patrol are caught in the explosion while Batman used a knock-out gas on the other villains. General Zahl even mourned the Doom Patrol's sacrifice (namely because he failed to reveal them as &quot;frauds&quot; and making the world love them even more, thus disappointing him). General Zahl and the other villains are later arrested by the authorities.

'''General Zod''' (full name '''Dru-Zod''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] who appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character, who first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #283 (April 1961), was created by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and initially designed by [[George Papp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = General Zod | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 136 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zod is a [[warlord]] from [[Superman]]'s home planet of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. As a Kryptonian, he exhibits the same powers and abilities as Superman and is consequently viewed as one of his greatest enemies.

In ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980), British actor [[Terence Stamp]] portrayed the character, which ''[[Total Film]]'' later ranked as #32 on their &quot;Top 50 Greatest Villains Of All Time&quot; list in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/the-top-50-greatest-heroes-villains-of-all-time-total-film-compiled-list/ |title=The Top 50 Greatest Heroes &amp; Villains Of All Time - ‘Total Film’ Compiled List |publisher=Snarkerati.com |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop-culture website [[IGN.com]] ranked General Zod as #30 on their list of the &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains&quot;, asserting that &quot;Stamp ''is'' Zod&quot; (emphasis in original).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/30.html |title=General Zod is number 30 - IGN |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was played by [[Michael Shannon]] in [[Zack Snyder]]'s 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', and by [[Callum Blue]] in ''[[Smallville]]''.

=={{anchor|Fictional character biography}}Publication history==

===Silver Age===
Dru-Zod is a [[megalomaniac]]al [[Kryptonian]], in charge of the military forces on Krypton. He knew [[Jor-El]], Superman's father, when Jor-El was an aspiring scientist. When the space program was abolished after the destruction of the inhabited moon Wegthor (engineered by renegade scientist [[Jax-Ur]]), he attempted to take over Krypton. Zod created an army of robotic duplicates of himself, all bearing a resemblance to [[Bizarro]]. He was sentenced to exile in the [[Phantom Zone]] for 40 years for his crimes. Zod was eventually released by [[Superboy]] when his term of imprisonment was up. However, he attempted to conquer Earth with the superpowers his Kryptonian body acquired under the yellow sun (the source of Superboy's own super-powers). With Zod's threat now obvious, Superboy was forced to oppose him and ultimately returned him to the Zone.

===Modern Age===

====Interim Zods: 1985–2005====
After DC's continuity altering crossover special ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985), DC editorial maintained for a number of years that no Kryptonians were to be depicted in comics aside from Superman, to reinforce his status as the last Kryptonian. This meant that characters like [[Supergirl]] and [[Power Girl]] were reimagined and Superman's Kryptonian canine [[Krypto]] became an ordinary house pet. However, writers of DC Comics still attempted to get around the no-Kryptonians rule by introducing &quot;new&quot; versions of Zod. Many of these were Zods of alternate universes. None persisted in DC continuity. After publishing its sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005), DC reintroduced the real General Zod in its 2006-2008 storyline ''[[Last Son (comics)|Superman: Last Son]]''. For this, it brought on board writer [[Richard Donner]], director of ''Superman'', the film which introduced Zod to the moviegoing public.

[[File:Superman Phantom Zone execution.jpg|thumb|Panel from ''Superman #22'' (October 1988). Superman (left) executing General Zod, Quex-Ul and Zaora (center left to right). Art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]]]
The first Zod to be introduced following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' was the Zod of a so-called &quot;pocket universe&quot; resembling the universe in which the comics took place; this allowed for a &quot;Kryptonian&quot; Zod to be introduced while maintaining Superman's status as the last of his race in the universe proper. This Zod came from a Krypton in the pocket universe, the universe itself having been created by the [[Time Trapper]]. Zod (along with companions [[Quex-Ul]] and [[Faora|Zaora]]) devastated the Earth of that universe following the death of its Superboy, despite the best efforts of a [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]] created by that world's heroic [[Lex Luthor]]. Eventually, the survivors of this world managed to contact the Superman of the main universe to help them, and he was able to take away the powers of the three super-criminals with only Gold Kryptonite (since he was not from that universe, the Kryptonite of that reality would have no effect on him).

However, the three vowed to some day regain their powers and return to Superman's world to kill him. Acknowledging that he could neither afford to leave them on the now-dead pocket Earth to let them die on their own nor imprison them on his world, Superman was forced to execute them with Green [[Kryptonite]].&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 2) #22 (October 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; This action caused him to question his powers and how to deal with evildoers, to the extent that an encounter with Brainiac caused Superman to manifest a more violent alter-ego in his sleep. Believing that he was becoming too dangerous to remain on Earth, Superman departed the planet for deep space to find somewhere he could live without causing further harm, until meeting with the alien [[Cleric (comics)|Cleric]] who helped him accept that he had sinned in the cause of justice and his exile from Earth was doing more harm than good.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; This version of Zod is based closely on the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] version; the significant difference is he killed everyone on the pocket Earth, rather than conquering them (there was no Superboy/Superman to stop him).

[[File:GeneralZodRtK.jpg|thumb|right|165px|&quot;Return to Krypton&quot; Zod from ''Adventures of Superman'' #589 (April 2001)|alt=General Zod in military-style uniform]]
A second incarnation of General Zod was introduced in the 2001 storyline &quot;Return to Krypton&quot;; this Zod was portrayed as that of an alternate reality that was created by the character [[Brainiac 13]].&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' #589 (April 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He was the head of the Kryptonian military in the alternate reality. Like the Pre-''Crisis'' version, Zod held the Kryptonian equivalent of [[fascist]] beliefs. He sent aliens to the bottle city of [[Kandor]] and planned a military coup. Zod was defeated by Superman and the Jor-El of Zod's alternate reality Krypton.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #776 (April 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Generalzodrussian21.png|thumb|left|165px|Russian General Zod|alt=General Zod full-length, with long red cape]]
{{anchor|General Zod#Russian Zod}}The third attempt to bring Zod to Modern Age comics was the &quot;Russian&quot; Zod, a Zod of human origin whose origin story was connected to Superman's. This General Zod is a [[Russians|Russian]] who was affected before his birth by [[Kryptonite]] [[radiation]], since he was the son of two [[cosmonaut]]s whose ship was too close to Kal-El's rocketship. This Zod is unnaturally weak under a yellow sun, but superpowered under a red sun (the opposite of Superman). After his parents died from radiation, he grew up in a [[KGB]] laboratory under the name &quot;Zed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; Apparently spoken to by the spirit of the Pocket Universe Zod, Russian Zod created a suit of red armor which filtered the sunlight, and declared himself ruler of the fictional former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] state of [[Pokolistan]]. After several inconclusive encounters with Superman, he revealed his long-range plan to turn the sun red and take Superman's place. This was temporarily successful until [[Lex Luthor]] rescued Superman, gave him a blast of yellow solar radiation to regain his powers, and worked to restore the sun. Superman returned to battle Zod, but refused to kill him. When the sun turned yellow again the now-vulnerable Zod struck Superman with all his power at super-speed, but was killed due to Superman's invulnerability.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

The final Zod before the character was finally reintroduced, the Zod of an alternate Phantom Zone appeared in the twelve-issue ''[[Superman: For Tomorrow|For Tomorrow]]'' storyline, written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and penciled by [[Jim Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' #204–215&lt;/ref&gt; This Zod lives alone in an alternate Phantom Zone and resents Superman for tampering with it.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' #206&lt;/ref&gt; By his own account he comes from the same Krypton as Superman and was exiled to the Phantom Zone by Superman's father, Jor-El. This Zod wears large, spiked black armor and when unmasked, is a bald, white-bearded old man. This incarnation also uses a variation of &quot;Kneel before Zod&quot;. He appeared in Metropia, a version of the Phantom Zone created by Superman to resemble a living world (including apparently-living beings). However, whether or not this was the real Zod of the pre-[[Infinite Crisis]] DC Universe, he has been superseded by the present storyline (which features a new Zod, freed from the Phantom Zone).&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' #214&lt;/ref&gt;

====General Zod returns: 2006–2011====
General Zod appeared in the ''[[Superman: Last Son]]'' storyline (written by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Richard Donner]], the director of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' and most of ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|Superman II]]''). In a similar story to that of ''Superman II'', Zod, [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], and [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]] escape from the Phantom Zone and come to Earth to try to turn it into a &quot;New Krypton&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #844&lt;/ref&gt; This incarnation is the first Post-Crisis Zod who came from Superman's Krypton, and not from an alternate reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #845&lt;/ref&gt;

The backstory for the three Kryptonians was revealed in ''Action Comics Annual'' #10.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics Annual'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the destruction of Krypton, Zod and his wife Ursa rebelled against their planet's oppressive government, but soon became lawless would-be tyrants who lusted for power. The government sentenced the trio to death, but Superman's father Jor-El pleaded for them to mitigate their sentence to imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, accepted on the condition that he would assume responsibility as their jailer. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and Ursa were able to have a child who was born immune to the Phantom Zone's effects, ultimately facilitating their escape, and named him Lor-Zod. On Earth, the boy was discovered by Superman and his wife Lois Lane, who adopted him as their own son and named him [[Chris Kent (comics)|Christopher Kent]]. For the duration of the &quot;Last Son&quot; storyline in ''Action Comics'', Chris Kent is depicted as an adopted son of Superman and his wife Lois across DC titles. Alongside Zod, Ursa and Non, 25 other Kryptonian criminals also escape the Zone and defeat a number of Earth's heroes, beginning their quest to conquer the planet. Zod ambushes Superman in revenge for Jor-El's actions and traps him in the Phantom Zone, which he later escapes the help of the heroic Phantom Zone prisoner [[Mon-El]]. With assistance from his traditional enemies [[Lex Luthor]], [[Metallo]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and [[Bizarro]], Superman takes on Zod's army. Out of nearly thirty Kryptonians, Superman's temporary allies successfully kill several, driving the rest back into the Phantom Zone alongside Zod and Ursa, who take Chris Kent with them.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #846&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later &quot;[[Superman: New Krypton|New Krypton]]&quot; arc storyline however, Zod is freed from the Phantom Zone once again by Supergirl's mother [[Alura]]. The 'bottled city of [[Kandor]]' is transformed into a populated Kryptonian planet (&quot;New Krypton&quot;), and Zod is appointed the leader of its army. In the &quot;World of New Krypton&quot; ''Action Comics'' storyline, when Superman decides to see what life is like on New Krypton, he is drafted into the Military Guild under General Zod. Zod and Superman maintain a mistrustful professional relationship. Despite their past, neither seems prepared to behave with marked aggression toward the other. Later, during a Kryptonian ceremony, Zod is shot by the Kryptonian Ral-Dar (who is working with Lois's father [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Sam Lane]]), leading Zod to appoint Superman as temporary General until his recovery. The two are involved in a Kryptonian political plot, but ultimately apprehend the planet's traitor and see a reform of New Krypton's Council. Peace is short-lived however due to an attack by the alien [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], who had been responsible for the bottling of Kandor in the first place. In &quot;Last Stand of New Krypton&quot;, New Krypton comes under attack by Brainiac, and Zod engineers a plan to defeat him; Zod is driven by an urge to avenge his prior defeat at the hands of the Coluan Brainiac, when Kandor was bottled from Old Krypton. The storyline ends with the planet's destruction, leading Zod to declare war on Earth, sparking the &quot;War of the Supermen&quot; storyline. After a fierce conflict between Superman and Zod in defence of Earth, Zod is pushed back into the Phantom Zone by his son, Chris Kent, who had freed himself from the Phantom Zone and became active as an adult superhero on planet Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: War of the Supermen'' #4 (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The New 52: 2011–2016====
In 2011, DC chose to revamp its continuity, rebooting many characters while retaining the histories for some others, as part of its [[The New 52]] publishing event. Following this, Zod is hinted at several times. A character resembling Zod made a cameo in ''Action Comics'' #5 (March 2012), as a prisoner in the Phantom Zone; in ''Action Comics'' #13 (December 2012) a ghost in the Phantom Zone says &quot;Kneel before...&quot; multiple times while attacking Superman, a reference to Zod's iconic saying. Zod makes his first full appearance in ''Action Comics'' #23.2: ''General Zod'' (September 2013), written by Greg Pak, with art by Ken Lashley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Action Comics Villains&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=First look: DC's Action Comics Villains month - Zod, Lex Luthor and more plus Michael Alan Nelson talks Cyborg Superman|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2013/06/first-look-dcs-action-comics-villains-month---zod-lex-luthor-and-more-plus-michael-alan-nelson-talks.html|last=Hayer|first=Chris E|date=June 4, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new origin for Zod was introduced. Zod was born to scientist parents. When he was a young boy, Zod and his parents traveled to Krypton's wilderness in order to discover new creatures. Their ship was attacked by creatures, leaving the family stranded in the jungle. While his parents were killed by the animals, Zod managed to survive for one year until Jor-El and his older brother Zor-El saved him. After reaching adulthood, Zod became one of Krypton's best soldiers, attaining the rank of general. Zod developed a hatred towards an alien species called the Char and secretly ordered the creation of a Char-looking creature, unleashing it on Krypton's population, so he could justify a war against the Char. Jor-El discovered the deception and turned Zod over to the authorities. The council found Zod guilty of treason and banished him and his closest followers, Faora and Non, to the Phantom Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Greg Pak|Pak, Greg]]|Title = [[Action Comics]]|Volume = 2|Issue = 23.2|Date = September 2013|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later, a mysterious event caused the Phantom Zone to weaken, allowing some of its prisoners to escape into normal space. Zod traveled to Earth, landing in the Sahara Desert. There, Zod's Kryptonian powers began to manifest for the first time, brutally slaughtering a group of travelers. Zod was soon attacked by the Justice League of America until Superman and Wonder Woman arrived, the latter restraining him with her magic lasso. Zod recognized Superman as Kal-El, the son of Jor-El. Superman decided to keep Zod in the Fortress of Solitude's alien zoo. While there, he reveals to Superman that Faora also traveled to Earth with him, and vows to track her down.

====DC Rebirth: 2016–present====
Once again imprisoned within the Phantom Zone, Zod was trapped within the boundaries of the Black Vault, a secret facility hidden in the [[Laptev Sea]]. [[Amanda Waller]] sent the [[Suicide Squad]] to steal the contents of the Black Vault and bring them back to her; however, in unlocking the previously hermetically sealed area, they unwillingly allowed Zod to tear open the now unstable link between Earth and the Phantom Zone and once again break free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]]|Artist=[[Jim Lee]]|Title = [[Suicide Squad]]|Volume = 5|Issue = 2|Date = September 2016|Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
* The General Zod of [[Earth-15]] is this world's Superman.&lt;ref&gt;''Countdown'' #24&lt;/ref&gt; This version is later killed by [[Superman Prime]], who was angry because Zod was &quot;not a maniac&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #30&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Zod of ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files]]'' was not a general of any kind. He was recast as a sociopathic 11-year-old, who created a deadly synthetic virus on Krypton for no reason other than fun. Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone because of his actions (the  first child ever sent to the Zone) until American scientists breached the Zone and discovered him. Taken in by the government and named &quot;Clark Kent&quot;, Zod would fool most of his adult superiors by playing the role of a scared child until he grew up and became the adult &quot;Super-Man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA: The Libert Files'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zod appears in ''[[Superman: Earth One]]'' in which he is called Zod-El, brother to Jor-El and thus Superman's uncle. This version of Zod is also responsible for the destruction of Krypton.

===DC Animated Universe===
* While not appearing in the [[DC animated universe]] television shows, General Zod (depicted as an [[Argo City|Argosian]] mad criminal) appears in ''[[Superman Adventures]]'' issue 21,&lt;ref name=&quot;Superman Adventures #21&quot;&gt;''Superman Adventures'' #21&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' issue 34 where he teams with Jax-Ur and [[Mala (Kryptonian)|Mala]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Unlimited'' #34&lt;/ref&gt;
* A version of Zod appears in the 2013 digital-first series ''Justice League Beyond 2.0'', taking place in the [[DC Animated Universe]], specifically in the futuristic setting of the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' animated series. In this series, Zod is revealed to be the son of [[Jax-Ur]], marking first appearance of General Zod in the continuity of the [[Bruce Timm]]'s ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', albeit a younger, innocent version of the megalomaniac General who, in fact, helps the new [[Justice League]].

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Powers and abilities of Superman}}
Like all Kryptonians under a yellow sun, General Zod possesses high-level superhuman strength, speed and endurance sufficient to stand against Superman and other Kryptonians; super hearing; x-ray vision; telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; super-breath and freeze-breath; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing and flight. Due to his background as a Kryptonian general, Zod possesses a detailed knowledge of military tactics, battle strategy, and is a relatively competent military leader. Because he was trained in fighting arts long before receiving his abilities, he typically has an edge over Superman's brawling skills, over-reliance on superhuman strength, and basic knowledge of advanced human and Kryptonian hand-to-hand combat.

Despite these advantages over Superman, Zod's main weakness is shown to be his arrogance and overestimation of his abilities. Not only does he underestimate Superman's other allies, but he also lacks the ability to acknowledge his mistakes due to his [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomania]]. When Zod originally escaped the Phantom Zone in the post-Crisis continuity, he proclaimed that he could have saved Krypton if his plan to kill the Council had succeeded; Superman's rational argument was that nobody on Krypton would have followed Zod, also drawing attention to Zod's inability to explain exactly what he would have done to avert Krypton's destruction, with Zod's only response being to reiterate his belief in his own success rather than provide any kind of counter to Superman's claims.

In addition, Zod's powers are often inferior to those of Superman, due to the latter being exposed to the yellow sun over the course of his entire life, while Zod typically only gets exposed for a short period of time before being defeated and returned to the Phantom Zone. This greater power combined with his superior control and experience with it gives Superman an edge over Zod's superior fighting skills. Additionally, similar to Superman, his strength is inferior to the likes of Doomsday and his speed is inferior to Speedsters such as the Flash. Like all Kryptonians, he is vulnerable to Kryptonite and red solar radiation; his durability does not provide protection from mind control and magic; and his strength and durability both have limits in that he cannot survive an atomic explosion without nearly fatal injuries and there are weights he cannot lift due to natural bodily limitation even under the empowering environment of a yellow sun as well as normal limits of adult Kryptonian superhuman strength.

==In other media==

===Television===

====Animation====
* General Zod appears in the 1988 animated series ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' episode &quot;The Hunter&quot;, voiced by [[René Auberjonois (actor)|René Auberjonois]]. This version is imprisoned in the Phantom Zone with two Kryptonian women ([[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Faora]]) whereas most portrayals of the conspiracy show the Zod trio composed of two men and one woman. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and his followers create The Hunter (a creature which can transmute itself into any substance that it touches) and send it to Earth. After the Hunter's fight with [[Superman]], Zod introduces it to Kryptonite where the Hunter ends up seeking a piece of Kryptonite that is in [[Lex Luthor]]'s possession. During the fight with the Hunter, Superman plays dead by going into a suspended animation thanks to a device he gave to [[Lois Lane]]. After being awoken from his suspended animation, Superman destroys the Hunter and uses the Phantom Zone Projector to ensure that Zod stays in the Phantom Zone.
* The Silver Age version of Zod makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' episode &quot;Phantoms&quot;. He is one of the many Phantom Zone prisoners attacking the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].
* General Zod appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode &quot;Field Trip,&quot; voiced by Jason J. Lewis. As Superman gives Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl a tour of the Fortress of Solitude and are shown the Phantom Zone Projector, General Zod, Faora, and an unidentified Kryptonian villain are released and Superman is accidentally sent to the Phantom Zone. Under the yellow sun, General Zod and his two followers gain superpowers and end up in a fight with Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl. As Blue Beetle and Stargirl hold off the Kryptonian villains, Firestorm uses Martin Stein's guidance to learn how to transmutate anything to Kryptonite. Testing on the ice, Firestorm transmutates it to Kryptonite which weakens General Zod and his two followers. Afterwards, Superman is freed from the Phantom Zone and General Zod and his followers are thrown into the Phantom Zone.

* Zod appears in the television series ''[[Smallville]]''. References to the character began to be made in the [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth season]] premiere, in which Zod's Kryptonian disciples Aethyr and Nam-Ek search for [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] (aka Kal-El). The season finale concludes with humanoid Kryptonian artificial computer and machine intelligence [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] turning [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] into a superpowered vessel for Zod's spirit, which has become a phantom wraith after its long imprisonment in the Phantom Zone. Clark is able to trap Zod's spirit once again in the [[Smallville (season 6)|sixth season]] premiere. [[Smallville (season 8)|Season eight]] later introduces a version of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] played by [[Samuel Witwer]] who is Zod and Faora's son. In [[Smallville (season 9)|season nine]], a powerless clone of Zod in his younger years (played by [[Callum Blue]]) emerges on Earth alongside an army of clones from Kryptonian city of [[Kandor]]. Over the course of the season, Zod is able to reacquire his Kryptonian powers and, learning of the original Zod's actions and accepting his true nature, becomes the villain he was always bound to become. When Clark defeats him in the season nine finale, he is left to the mercy of the Kandorian army once his crimes are exposed. He makes a final appearance in the [[Smallville (season 10)|tenth season]] episode &quot;Dominion&quot;, where it is shown that the Kandorians punished him by sending him to the Phantom Zone, where he was reunited with the original Zod's disembodied spirit, thereby resurrecting the original General Zod in a younger form. After Clark is able to escape his own imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, they destroy the exit, sealing Zod and his minions inside forever.

* General Zod appears in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', portrayed by actor [[Terence Stamp]]. [[Richard Donner]]'s [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|Director's Cut]] includes a scene where Zod is shown laughing while using an Armalite AR-10 to shoot soldiers in the White House. He is eventually defeated when Superman lures Zod and his allies to the Fortress after reprogramming a chamber designed to remove Kryptonian powers so that the red sunlight it generates will be reflected outward into the rest of the Fortress rather than into the chamber, allowing Superman to retain his powers while depriving Zod of his. In the Richard Donner cut, it was shown that Superman went backwards in time again to prevent Zod and his followers from escaping from the Phantom Zone. In 2009, issue #7 of the 15-story ''[[Superman: World of New Krypton]]'' copied this with the phrase &quot;Kneel Before Kal-El&quot; on the cover. Director [[Richard Lester]] inspired much of Zod (and company)'s destruction of downtown [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. One scene involved his heat vision being reflected by Superman. Standing in front of a tanning salon billboard, he comically imprints his silhouette over the bikini-clad figure; the rest of the poster is charred. In a later scene, Superman knocks him to the street and grabs him by his hand and foot; he spins Zod violently then throws him miles away where he crashes through a neon [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkfUUqowQjA |title=Superman II Coca Cola sign scene |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This portrayal is rated #58 on ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's &quot;100 Greatest Villains of All Time&quot; list.&lt;ref&gt;''Wizard'' #177; [[Jason Mewes]] also uses the phrase in the 1996 movie ''[[Mallrats]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Zod is notably the only other villain to appear in the film series originating from the comics beyond [[Lex Luthor]].
* During the early development of ''[[Superman Returns]]'', film director [[Brett Ratner]] wanted Zod to appear. He wanted English actor [[Jude Law]] for the role, but Law turned down the role when [[Bryan Singer]] entered for direct the project after Ratner's departure to direct ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slashfilm.com/jude-law-superman-story/&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Zod was omitted from the final script.&lt;ref&gt;http://screenrant.com/bryan-singer-superman-returns-criticism-darseid-sequel/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michael Shannon as Zod.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Shannon]] as General Zod in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.]]
* In the alternate world of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', Zod (voiced by [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]]) causes the destruction of Krypton by drilling the planet for its core in order to have the energy needed for his war machine and stops Jor-El from implanting his genetic code onto the egg created by Lara. Knowing the planet is about to blow up, Zod touches it to implant his genetic code, leading that world's version of Superman to grow up to look and behave more like Zod. Growing up, Superman is under the impression that his father was a good man due to having limited knowledge about Krypton. After being told about Zod, Superman calls his father a madman.
* General Zod appears in the [[Zack Snyder]] film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', played by [[Michael Shannon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Gregg | last=Kilday | title=Michael Shannon Set to Play Villain General Zod in 'Superman: Man of Steel' | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=April 10, 2011 | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/michael-shannon-set-play-villain-176799 | accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is from Kandor and is the head of Krypton's Military Guild, who becomes so dissatisfied with the planet's ruling council's decisions that he initiates a rebellion. He discovers that the scientist [[Jor-El]] stole The Codex, the key to genetically-engineering Kryptonians, and that his son [[Kal-El]] was born naturally (which is against Kryptonian Law as all Kryptonians are engineered to be more efficient). Angered, Zod fights Jor-El but loses. Zod manages to kill the scientist before he and his forces (called &quot;The Sword of Rao&quot;), including his second-in-command [[Faora]], are captured and sentenced to 300 cycles of somatic reconditioning within the [[Phantom Zone]]. Zod then cryptically warns Jor-El's [[Lara (comics)|widow]] that he will find their son. Krypton's core destroys itself, killing all Kryptonians. Thirty-three years later, Zod arrives on the planet Earth and extorts its people into handing over Kal-El (now going by the name [[Clark Kent]]) by threatening Earth's destruction. Zod reveals to Clark Kent how he and his team refit the Phantom Zone projector into the ship &quot;Black Zero&quot;, acquired a &quot;world engine&quot; device, scouted unsuccessfully for surviving Kryptonian colonies, and traveled to Earth after Clark Kent triggered the distress signal of the scout ship he found in the Arctic. He then reveals his plan to terraform the planet with the world engine and use The Codex (that Jor-El placed within Clark Kent's individual cells as a baby) to repopulate the world with genetically-engineered Kryptonians, which will kill all of Earth's indigenous life in the process. When Zod arrives at the Kent Farm and threatens [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]] for the location of the codex, Superman attacks him in a rage and defeats Faora and Nam-Ek in a destructive battle in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], forcing them to retreat. Zod releases the world engine on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and over the [[Indian Ocean]] to begin terraformation, but Clark Kent (now dubbed &quot;Superman&quot;) destroys the device while the [[United States Armed Forces|United States Military]] use Superman's modified ship as an airstrike device against Black Zero, creating a singularity that sucks all Kryptonians (save for Zod and Superman) back into the Phantom Zone, foiling Zod's plans. Enraged at the loss of his people, Zod engages Superman in an even, catastrophic fight throughout Metropolis and briefly in space; Zod's advantages, combat experience and training, are matched by Superman's superior adeptness to his powers and higher solar energy supply (having grown up on Earth and therefore adapted to its atmosphere and conditions). Eventually, Superman gets the upper hand and subdues Zod, but the General prepares to murder a trapped family with his heat vision and claims he will never stop, forcing Superman to reluctantly snap Zod's neck to save the family, killing him.
* In ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', LexCorp had taken in the corpse of Zod to study Kryptonian anatomy and origins. Lex Luthor discovers that Kryptonians are vulnerable to kryptonite and then uses it to get Zod's fingerprints to access the ancient Kryptonian scout ship to create a &quot;[[Doomsday (comics)|Kryptonian Deformity]]&quot; using Zod's body and his own blood where they created a cocoon that the &quot;Kryptonian Deformity&quot; emerged from. Michael Shannon did not film any scenes for ''Dawn of Justice'' despite being credited, and the corpse was created using the physique of fitness model [[Greg Plitt]] and a head-shot of Shannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=BATMAN VS SUPERMAN Zod Body BTS ADI|author=studioADI|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=April 2, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdRTQDXxdYY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', Zod makes a brief cameo on CNN News, in a clip showing Superman fighting him and then projecting him up into the Phantom Zone. He has no lines.

===Video games===
* The 1988 ''[[Superman (Kemco game)|Superman]]'' [[Nintendo|NES]] game has Zod, Ursa, and Non as the final bosses whom Superman must defeat in order to win the game. The fight takes place at the fictional Statue of Freedom in Metropolis, based on the [[Statue of Liberty]].

===Novels===
In the novel ''The Last Days of Krypton'' (by [[Kevin J. Anderson]], ISBN 0-06-134074-X), General Zod (also known as Commissioner Dru-Zod) is the son of Cor-Zod (former head of the Kryptonian Council). Initially a middle-level bureaucrat, he takes advantage of a major planetary cataclysm and the apparent decapitation of the government to seize absolute power as a military despot. He is ultimately overthrown by a resistance movement led by scientist [[Jor-El]] and his brother, civic leader [[Zor-El]]. They had formerly worked with Zod until his ambitions and misuse of Jor-El's Rao Beam and Phantom Zone, showed them his true nature and turned them against him. He and his two henchmen are banished forever to the Phantom Zone. The reactionary Council, however, decide to make sure Zod can never be released, and, in doing so snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. What the comet, pressures building up within Krypton and Rao's increasing instability fail to accomplish, is ironically achieved by the actions of Krypton's Council out of an irrational fear that Jor-El might free Zod and his minions.

'''Genevieve Lhermitte''' is a [[Belgians|Belgian]] woman who killed all her five children on February 28, 2007. She killed each of her children by slitting their throats with a kitchen knife stolen from a local grocery store while her husband was visiting family in Morocco. After Lhermitte killed her children, she then tried to kill herself. The suicide attempt failed, and Lhermitte was taken into custody and charged with [[murder|first-degree murder]]. She was subsequently sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyMotion&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1093211/Perfect-mother-massacred-children-slitting-throats-husband-away.html 'Perfect mother' massacred her five children by slitting their throats while husband was away | The Daily Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lhermitte had regularly seen a psychiatrist and was reported to demonstrate serious mental issues. She claimed that she was driven to kill her children due to troubles at home (namely, living with an outsider who financially supported the family).

==Personal life==
Genevieve Lhermitte was born on November 16, 1966 in [[Brussels]] to Michel Lhermitte, a businessman and student, and Marina Schoevaert, a nurse.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Lhermitte had two younger sisters: Catherine in 1969, and Mireille in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot;&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/extra/pdf/lhermitte.pdf Official Indictment of the General Counsel | The Standard Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Though she struggled with her coursework and self-confidence during her secondary studies, Lhermitte graduated in 1991 with a diploma in [[French language|French]] and [[History]] from the Educational Institute of Social Promotion of the French Community (IEPSCF) in [[Uccle]]. It was during the 1988-1989 year at IEPSCF that Lhermitte met her future husband, Bouchaib Moqadem, who was studying mathematics and physics but did not complete his studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt;

Lhermitte and Moqadem married on September 22, 1990,&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=parismatch&gt;[http://www.parismatch.com/Actu-Match/Monde/Actu/La-veritable-histoire-d-A-perdre-la-raison-420665/ The true story behind 'Loving Without Reason' | Paris Match]&lt;/ref&gt; and moved into the apartment of Dr. Michel Schaar, a physician, with whom Moqadem was residing. Schaar had befriended Moqadem's family in [[Morocco]] in the 1980s and served as the young man's host in [[Belgium]], and Moqadem considered Schaar as an adoptive father.&lt;ref name=&quot;parismatch&quot; /&gt; While Moqadem worked at a [[convenience store]], it was Schaar that was the primary financial provider.  Lhermitte did not object to living with Schaar in his apartment as she thought it would be on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt;

In 1991, Lhermitte was hired as a teacher. Shortly after beginning her new career, Lhermitte gave birth to her first child, Yasmine (b. August 13, 1992).&lt;ref name=&quot;parismatch&quot; /&gt; Three years later, she delivered her second child, Nora (b. February 13, 1995). From June 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996, Lhermitte was granted leave from her teaching position due to [[postpartum depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;parismatch&quot; /&gt; After the birth of Lhermitte's first child Yasmin, Schaar purchased a house for himself and the couple to live in, and he dedicated his apartment to his practice. In 1996, Schaar hired Moqadem to serve as his filing assistant part-time, then full-time in 1998. During this period, Schaar still covered most expenses, including vacations, house repairs, monthly allowances, and [[life insurance]] for each family member.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt; Lhermitte gave birth to two more daughters, Miriam (b. April 20, 1997) and Mina (May 20, 1999), before the family's move from Brussels to the provincial town of [[Nivelles]]. Schaar paid the [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] and lived on the second floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;parismatch&quot; /&gt;

Tensions began rising between Lhermitte and her husband. Moqadem would spend long hours away from home, becoming a regular at a bar and a spa. In addition, he would take several trips each year to visit his family in [[Marrakesh]], with the length of each trip ranging from a week to a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt; Lhermitte's first son and fifth child, Mehdi, was born on August 9, 2003. The following year, Schaar recommended that Lhermitte should see a psychiatrist&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt; and she began consulting the psychiatrist Dr. Diderick Veldekens in 2005.&lt;ref name=lesoir-reclame-3-millions&gt;[http://www.lesoir.be/archives?url=/actualite/belgique/2010-09-01/lhermitte-reclame-3-millions-a-son-psy-790622.php Lhermitte claims 3 million from her psychiatrist | Le Soir]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
On February 28, 2007, Moqadem was expected to return from a trip to [[Morocco]] to visit his family. Lhermitte took her eldest daughter Yasmin to a [[dermatology]] appointment. After picking up the rest of her children from school and preparing lunch for them, Lhermitte heard a voice tell her, &quot;the machine is running.&quot; &lt;ref name=le-soir-exasperated&gt;[http://www.lesoir.be/archives?url=/actualite/belgique/2010-09-01/lhermitte-reclame-3-millions-a-son-psy-790622.php Voice slipped into the head of exasperated mother | Le Soir]&lt;/ref&gt; Lhermitte mailed two letters: a letter with jewelry for her sisters, and the other letter to her friend Valerie. In the letter to Valerie, she called Dr. Michel Schaar &quot;a rotten bastard&quot; who &quot;stole&quot; the intimacy between herself, her husband, and her children.&lt;ref name=&quot;parismatch&quot; /&gt; She also accused her husband of being &quot;deaf&quot; and &quot;blind&quot; to her concerns regarding Dr. Schaar.&lt;ref name=&quot;le-soir-exasperated&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;7sur7&quot;&gt;[http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1502/Belgique/article/detail/530602/2008/12/05/Genevieve-Lhermitte-jugee-a-Nivelles-des-lundi-pour-cinq-infanticides.dhtml Genevieve Lhermitte tried at Nivelles Monday on five counts of infanticide | 7Sur7]&lt;/ref&gt; After mailing the letters, she went to a grocery store and slipped two knives into her shopping bag.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;7sur7&quot; /&gt;

Lhermitte told investigators that, when she returned, she hid the knives in a drawer and called over her youngest daughter Mina while the other children were watching [[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over|Spy Kids 3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;parismatch&quot; /&gt; Lhermitte tried to strangle Mina, but when the child struggled Lhermitte resorted to slashing her throat with one of the stolen knives, all while speaking comforting words and apologizing to the child.&lt;ref name=&quot;7sur7&quot; /&gt; Medhi was the next to be killed, the youngest and the only son. When her attempts to strangle her child again failed, Lhermitte cut Medhi's throat and washed the knife afterward in the bathroom sink.&lt;ref name=&quot;le-soir-exasperated&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;7sur7&quot; /&gt;

According to her account, Lhermitte then told daughter Myriam that she had a surprise for her in the office. When Myriam entered the office, Lhermitte told her to sit on a chair and wear a blue handkerchief over her eyes. Once Myriam was seated, Lhermitte took a marble plaque she found nearby and smashed it over Myriam's head, and then cut her throat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;7sur7&quot; /&gt; Nora, who was allegedly Dr. Schaar's favorite [[godparent|goddaughter]], was asked to sit in a chair while Lhermitte slit her throat from behind. After Nora had been killed, Lhermitte wrote the letters &quot;JUD&quot; on the bathroom mirror in Nora's blood, and later stated that she had intended to spell the name &quot;[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]].&quot;&lt;ref name=lefigaro&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2008/12/18/01003-20081218ARTFIG00014-infanticide-l-expertise-psychiatrique-fait-debat-.php Infanticide: psychiatric experts debate | Le Figaro]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dh.be&gt;[http://www.dhnet.be/infos/faits-divers/article/173515/trois-lettres-de-sang.html Three letters of blood | La Dernière Heure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lhermitte's last victim was her eldest daughter, Yasmin. The mother called over Yasmin and told her she had a surprise for her, just like she had done with Myriam. Lhermitte attacked Yasmin from behind as she entered the office, but Yasmin was able to dodge the knife by diving to the ground. After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed her in the back and slashed her throat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;parismatch&quot; /&gt; With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. When she realized that the wound would not be fatal, she wrote &quot;call the police&quot; in red marker on her door and called [[emergency service]]s to the house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;le-soir-exasperated&quot; /&gt; Investigators found the four children tucked in their beds, some with stuffed toys in their arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indictment&quot; /&gt;

==Trial==
The trial began on December 8, 2008 and lasted about two weeks, ending December 19, 2008 in the [[Assizes|Assize Court]] of Brabant-Wallon in [[Nivelles]].
Genevieve Lhermitte's lawyers were Daniel Spreutels and Xavier Magnee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/3697850/Belgian-mother-on-trial-for-killing-her-five-children.html Belgian mother on trial for killing her five children | The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[jury]] consisted of eight women and four men. Genevieve Lhermitte confessed to the murder of her children, so the trial focused on what drove Lhermitte commit the crime. Xavier Magnee told the jury, &quot;Your task is to discover why a woman who had hitherto been a perfect mother suddenly exploded.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyMotion&quot; /&gt; This statement was made early on in the trial and started the thought process of what made Lhermitte so unstable that she would kill her own children. Prosecutor Pierre Rans began opening statements with a description of the scene that met emergency services on February 28, 2007 at the former teacher's home in [[Nivelles]]. The [[prosecutor]] asked for 30 years in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;maximum sentence&quot;&gt;[http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/archief_EN/2.1340/news/1.438672 Lhermitte sentenced to life-long in prison | Flanders News]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Lhermitte testified that her role as wife and mother was disrupted by having the middle-aged Belgian doctor, Michel Schaar, living in the same house as part of the family. According to Lhermitte, Scharr accompanied her and Moqadem on their [[honeymoon]] and stayed in their room. Lhermitte stated, &quot;We [Lhermitte and Moqadem] had to wait until he fell asleep before we could make love. I found that weird but Bouchaib said he regarded him as his [[stepfamily|stepfather]]. I think the doctor loved my husband in a [[platonic love|platonic]] way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyMotion&quot; /&gt;
Apart from explaining Scharr's intrusion on her relationship with her husband, Lhermitte also mentioned their family's reliance on Dr. Schaar: &quot;He watched TV with us in the evenings and went on holiday with us in the summer. We depended on him financially.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyMotion&quot; /&gt;
In court, Lhermitte was asked why she laid the dead body of her 13-year-old daughter Nora in the bathroom used by Dr Schaar. She replied: &quot;I wanted to hurt him. Nora was his favorite.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyMotion&quot; /&gt;

The trial ended with Lhermitte receiving the maximum sentence for the [[murder]] of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her [[closing argument]], Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions.&lt;ref name =&quot;maximum sentence&quot; /&gt; Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of [[sanity|sound mind]] when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions.&lt;ref name =&quot;maximum sentence&quot; /&gt; Lhermitte had been battling with [[depression (mood)|depression]] for many years. She concluded that she saw the [[murder]] of her children and committing [[suicide]] as her only way out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/es/news/spanish-news/Lhermitte_-not-accountable_48108.html Lhermitte not accountable | Expatica Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Trial billing===
Lhermitte filed for and received a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le mari de Geneviève Lhermitte accepte le divorce|url=http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1502/Belgique/article/detail/634830/2009/01/22/Le-mari-de-Genevieve-Lhermitte-accepte-le-divorce.dhtml|accessdate=28 August 2013|newspaper=7sur7|date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the trial, Lhermitte was not able to pay for the trial costs, so under Belgian law it fell to her now ex-husband to pick up the bill. This conformed to the [[Law of Belgium]], with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system.&lt;ref name=&quot;husband&quot;&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/world-old/belgium-bills-ex-husband-of-child-killer-genevieve-lhermitte-for-court-costs/story-e6frfkyi-1225846393537 Belgium bills ex-husband of child killer Genevieve Lhermitte for court costs | News Limited]&lt;/ref&gt; Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature of the tragedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;husband&quot; /&gt;

In February 2010, Moqadem remarried Asmae Beldi, a professor of Islamic law at the Faculty of Islamic Sciences in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Je veux redevenir pere |url=http://archives.sudpresse.be/bruxelles-temoignage-%26%238220-je-veux-redevenir-pere_t-20100213-H2A2D7.html?queryand=%2Bgenevieve%2Blhermitte&amp;firstHit=0&amp;sort=datedesc&amp;by=20&amp;when=-1&amp;pos=0&amp;all=0&amp;nav=0 |publisher=Sudpresse.be |accessdate=28 August 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A daughter was born to the couple about a year later. In June 2013, it was reported that Moqadem had lost 30,000 euros in an investment scam and that he was being harassed by Lhermitte's former attorney for further fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bouchaib Moqadem victime d'un escroc|url=http://www.sudinfo.be/762677/article/actualite/belgique/2013-07-08/bouchaib-moqadem-victime-d-un-escroc-il-a-investi-30000%E2%82%AC-dans-une-agence-en-fail|accessdate=28 August 2013|newspaper=Sudinfo.be|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-trial lawsuit===
After being sentenced to life imprisonment, Lhermitte filed a [[lawsuit]] seeking €3m in damages against her [[psychiatrist]], Diderik Veldekens. She said that had her psychiatrist rushed to see her while she was in her disturbed state, the crime would not have been committed. Lhermitte wanted to “secure recognition of the prejudice genuinely suffered” due to the psychiatrist’s alleged inaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/World/News/Child-killer-mom-suing-doctor-20100901 Child-killer mom suing doctor | News24]&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Veldekens reported meeting with Lhermitte after a first alarming letter, but couldn't meet with her on February 13, 2007 due to his full schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bofywy.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/a-mothers-psychiatrist-infanticide-attack/ Veldekens Statement | Wordpress]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the case was dismissed against Veldekens. The court ruled that the criminal charges against the psychiatrist were &quot;irrelevant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;psychiatrist&quot;&gt;[http://www.lavenir.net/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20111217_00094917 Psychiatrist of Genevieve Lhermitte blamed in crime | Nivelles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Belgian [[film director|director]] and [[screenwriter]] [[Joachim Lafosse]] released ''[[Our Children]]'', a film based on the story, to positive reviews in 2012. One reviewer called the film a &quot;gloomy and penetrating psychological drama&quot; that portrays the [[claustrophobia]] of a [[protagonist]] who lives in an environment in which &quot;the walls are constantly closing in around her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/cannes-review-our-children-327715 Our Children: Cannes Review | The Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Our Children'' also attained an 93% rating on the aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/our_children_2012/ Our Children | Rotten Tomatoes]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émilie Dequenne]], a French-speaking Belgian actress, played the character based on Genevieve Lhermitte. Dequenne won the [[Un Certain Regard Award]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and &quot;Best Actress&quot; at the [[Saint Petersburg International Film Festival]] for her role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/theDailyArticle/59511.html Un Certain Regard Awards | Cannes Film Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Moqadem and Schaar filed a lawsuit against Lafosse demanding that they be able to review the film's screenplay. The 4th Civil Chamber of the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Court of Brussels]] ruled that the [[lawsuit]] was &quot;admissible but unfounded.&quot; However, production had already begun — cast negotiations were finished, and the team had already approached the French government about receiving subsidies — and Lafosse demonstrated no intent to hand over his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhnet-no-screenplay&quot;&gt;[http://www.dhnet.be/infos/faits-divers/article/336567/lhermitte-joachim-lafosse-ne-devra-pas-transmettre-la-copie-du-scenario-de-son-film.html Joachim Lafosse will not send a copy of his screenplay | La Dernière Heure]&lt;/ref&gt; The pair's lawyer subsequently released an official statement: &quot;Moqadem and Schaar feel that this is a violation of their privacy and do not understand why the filmmakers have so little respect for them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dhnet-no-screenplay&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12301">[[File:Geneviève Dieudonné.jpg|thumb|Geneviève, from the cover of ''The Vampire Genevieve''.]]

'''Geneviève Dieudonné''' is a character appearing in a number of works by [[Kim Newman]].

==Overview==
According to Newman, there are three versions of Geneviève, one for each series ([[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer Fantasy]], ''[[Anno Dracula]]'', and the ''[[Diogenes Club series]]''). Each has a different middle name but each is a &quot;trans-continual cousin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADBG&quot;&gt;[http://www.johnnyalucard.com/ad.html Anno Dracula: The Background]&lt;/ref&gt; All of them share a number of similar features, however: she is a beautiful blonde female [[vampire]] from [[Brittany]] (or its otherworldly equivalent), turned by the vampire elder Chandagnac when she was 16. Although she is around 400 years old by the time the stories with her are set, she still resembles a 16-year-old girl. According to Newman, her first name comes from a woman he once knew, while her last name comes from [[Albert Dieudonné]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Intro&quot;&gt;[http://www.johnnyalucard.com/introgen.html An Introduction to The Vampire Genevieve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
===Warhammer Fantasy===
'''Genevieve Sandrine du Pointe du Lac Dieudonné''' originally appeared in the 1989 [[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer Fantasy]] novel ''Drachenfels'', written under Newman's pen name Jack Yeovil. She later appeared in the novel ''Beasts in Velvet'', several short stories collected in ''Genevieve Undead'' and ''Silver Nails'', and the complete collection, ''The Vampire Genevieve''. According to Newman, &quot;the reason she doesn't have an accent on her name in GW books is that word-processing/printing techniques were so primitive back then that putting in accents was a major pain and used only on special occasions, like when listing her last name, Dieudonné.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Intro&quot; /&gt;

In the fictional setting of Warhammer Fantasy, Geneviève was born in [[Bretonnia]] in the year 1839 of the Imperial Calendar. She was given the Dark Kiss by Chandagnac in 1855, and traveled with him for some time. Their destinations included [[the Empire (Warhammer)|the Empire]], [[Cathay (Warhammer)|Cathay]] (where she studied magic and martial arts), and [[Araby (Warhammer)|Araby]] (where she was a slave). After Chandagnac's death, she worked at a vampire tavern for a century, before joining a band of adventurers. During this time and afterward, she became a [[mercenary]], [[spy]], a [[convent]]-dweller, an [[actress]] (for a single show) playing herself, a wanderer, and an [[assassination|assassin]]. After foiling a plot to start a war between vampires and humans, she settled down and married her lover, the [[playwright]] Detlef Sierck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiveworldterra.co.uk/Encyclopedia/definition_Genevieve.html Hive World Terra Encyclopedia - Genevieve Dieudonne]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman has stated that Geneviève is one of the most popular characters of Warhammer Fantasy and that &quot;a lot of girls were taken with Geneviève as an unusual, non-princessy identification figure (all the Jack Yeovil books have action heroines with [[Marvel Comics]]-style 'problems' beyond beating up the next bad guy).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Intro&quot; /&gt;

===Anno Dracula===
'''Geneviève Sandrine d'Isle Dieudonné''' is a major character in the first novel in Newman's [[Anno Dracula series|''Anno Dracula'' series]], ''[[Anno Dracula (novel)|Anno Dracula]]''. The ''Anno Dracula'' series combines characters and situations from numerous different works of fiction and Newman credited himself as Jack Yeovil in the back of the book.&lt;ref&gt;''Anno Dracula'' afterword&lt;/ref&gt;

Her fictional background is gradually revealed throughout the series. She was born in 1416 Brittany. Her father was a doctor, and she learned much from his trade. Disguised as a boy, she fought for [[Joan of Arc]];&lt;ref name=&quot;BRB&quot;&gt;''The Bloody Red Baron''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1432, after her death, she was given the Dark Kiss by Chandagnac.&lt;ref name=&quot;AD&quot;&gt;''Anno Dracula''&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, she had a variety of occupations, including nurse, courtesan, slave, and soldier, once more disguising herself as a male to fight under both [[Francis Drake]] against the [[Spanish Armada]] and [[Napoleon]] during the [[French invasion of Russia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BRB&quot; /&gt; She was a good friend and implied lover of [[Carmilla|Carmilla Karnstein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AD&quot; /&gt;

In 1888 (during the events of ''Anno Dracula''), several years after [[Count Dracula]] takes over Britain, Geneviève helps [[The Diogenes Club|Diogenes Club]] agent Charles Beauregard hunt down the vampire-killer known as &quot;[[Jack the Ripper|Silver Knife]]&quot;, who is eventually revealed to be [[John Seward|Jack Seward]], who she had worked with at [[Toynbee Hall]]. Shortly after, she helps Beauregard, whom she has become a lover with, assassinate [[Queen Victoria]] on orders of [[Mycroft Holmes]], thus dissolving Dracula's claim to the British throne. In the sequel, ''[[The Bloody Red Baron]]'', Geneviève is absent; according to Newman, this was because she &quot;was becoming too strong a character for her own good&quot; and it allowed him to build up another character, Kate Reed, in her stead.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADBG&quot; /&gt; She is mentioned often in the book, however, and is said to have moved to an [[Orange (fruit)|orange farm]] in [[California]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BRB&quot; /&gt; (which, from later works, would make her one of the first vampires in California, much less the [[United States]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CITD&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/originals/originals_archive/newman/newman1.html Castle in the Desert]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, she returns as a main character in the third book in the series, ''[[Dracula Cha Cha Cha]]'', where in 1959 she has to cope with the deaths of both Dracula and her lover Beauregard.&lt;ref name=&quot;JT&quot;&gt;''Dracula Cha Cha Cha''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Newman, he brought her back because he realized her story still was not finished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mania.com/dances-undead-conversation-kim-newman_article_22851.html Dances With the Undead: A Conversation with Kim Newman]&lt;/ref&gt;

She appears in several of the short stories set afterwards. In the 1970s, under the name &quot;Gené Dee&quot;, she becomes a [[private investigator]] after assisting [[Philip Marlowe]] in a case,&lt;ref name=&quot;CITD&quot; /&gt; although she finally retires from the business after a 1981 investigation involving [[Orson Welles]] and a cheerleader called &quot;[[Buffy Summers|Barbie the Vampire Slayer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSM&quot;&gt;&quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These stories were incorporated into the novel ''Johnny Alucard''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intemblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/casting-play-interview-with-kim-newman.html Casting a play: Interview with Kim Newman]&lt;/ref&gt;

A devout [[Roman Catholic]], she spent much of her early life wondering if she truly was [[damnation|damned]] as her priest had stated, but later learned to ignore and outgrow such self-destructive sentiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSM&quot; /&gt; However, she is still very conscious of her responsibilities, and refused to pass along the Dark Kiss in almost all situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;AD&quot; /&gt; She was also a forward-thinking and imaginative person, harboring an interest in [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[science fiction]], [[alternate history]], and [[dystopian fiction]]. She read ''[[Louis Geoffroy|Napoleon and the Conquest of the World]]'', ''[[Dracula]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|Big Brother]]'', ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', and ''[[On the Beach (novel)|On the Beach]]'' when they came out, and for a time wished to be an [[astronaut]] after reading works of [[Arthur C. Clarke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JT&quot; /&gt;

In a proposed ''Anno Dracula'' movie, Newman had hoped to cast first [[Isabelle Adjani]], and then [[Juliette Binoche]] as Geneviève.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mania.com/dances-undead-kim-newman-part-2_article_23033.html Dances with the Undead: Kim Newman, Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Diogenes Club===
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
'''Genèvieve Sandrine Ysolde Dieudonné''', also known as &quot;Jennifer Dee&quot; and &quot;Geneva Deodati&quot;, has appeared in a number of Newman's [[Diogenes Club series|Diogenes Club books and short stories]], along with several ''Anno Dracula'' characters including Beauregard, Edwin Winthrop, and Catriona Kaye. Although she is reticent about her past, it presumably resembles that of her ''Anno Dracula'' counterpart up to the late 19th century, where Dracula's invasion of England succeeded in the ''Anno Dracula'' timeline and failed (if it occurred at all) in the main Diogenes Club timeline. In this timeline, she remained in England throughout the 20th century, doing occasional work with the Diogenes Club. It is mentioned by the Undertaking that she was excommunicated in 1638 by the [[Roman Inquisition]].

This version of Genèvieve appears in the short story &quot;The Big Fish&quot;, battling [[Cthulhu Mythos|Lovecraftian]] menaces alongside Edwin Winthrop during [[World War II]];&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Big Fish&quot; was first published in ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' in 1993, and most recently collected in ''The Secret Files of the Diogenes Club''&lt;/ref&gt; four stories in the ''Seven Stars'' sequence (&quot;The Trouble with Barrymore&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Big Fish&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron8.htm |title=The Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology, part VIII |accessdate=2008-07-21 |first=Win Scott |last=Eckert |authorlink=Win Scott Eckert |date= |work=The Wold Newton Universe web site }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Biafran Bank Manager&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron10.htm |title=The Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology, part X |accessdate=2008-07-21 |first=Win Scott |last=Eckert |authorlink=Win Scott Eckert |date= |work=The Wold Newton Universe web site}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Dog Story&quot;; and &quot;The Duel of Seven Stars&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron12.htm |title=The Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology, part XII |accessdate=2008-07-21 |first=Win Scott |last=Eckert |authorlink=Win Scott Eckert |date= |work=The Wold Newton Universe web site }}&lt;/ref&gt;); and in the short story &quot;Cold Snap&quot;, featuring 1970s Diogenes Club agent [[Richard Jeperson]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cold Snap&quot; first appeared in the collection ''The Secret Files of the Diogenes Club'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She is a major character in &quot;Sorcerer Conjurer Wizard Witch&quot;, which depicts her first meeting with Beauregard in the Diogenes Club timeline.

==Other==
Geneviève Dieudonné is briefly mentioned in &quot;In the Air&quot;, the first segment of Newman and [[Eugene Byrne]]'s alternate history work ''[[Back in the USSA]]''. In it, she is a schoolgirl around sixteen years old in a 1951 Kansas that is part of the United Socialist States of America, and has a love song written for her. She is presumably not a vampire in this universe, and it is unexplained how a girl in a poor town in Soviet Kansas had a French name.

In Newman's short story &quot;The Mark of Kane&quot;, collected in ''[[Tales_of_the_Shadowmen#Tales_of_the_Shadowmen.2C_Volume_4:_Lords_of_Terror|Tales of the Shadowmen Volume 4: Lords of Terror]]'', Geneviève is briefly mentioned as one of the former agents of the &quot;Angels of Music&quot;, a ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''-type private detective agency run by [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Monsieur Erik]] out of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]].

'''Genildo Ferreira de França''' (aka. '''Neguinho de Zé Ferreira''') was a Brazilian [[mass murder]]er who killed 14 people in and around [[Santo Antônio do Potengi]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Brazil]] on May 21 and May 22, 1997. He was eventually cornered by police and committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wAZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wsAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3588,5020834&amp;dq= Rampage leaves 16 dead], ''[[Telegraph Herald]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SoJKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oYYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=4906%2C4620046&amp;dq= Former soldier kills 15 in rampage], ''[[The Vindicator]]'' (May 23, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ferreira was born in Santo Antônio dos Barreiros (now [[Santo Antônio do Potengi]]) and served in the 7th Battalion of Combat Engineers (7o Batalhão de Engenharia de Combate) in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] until January 1990,&lt;ref name=VEJA&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=COgeAQAAMAAJ Rastro de sangue], in ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' (May 28, 1997) (p. 96/97)&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed an affinity to weapons and was considered an excellent marksman.&lt;ref name=CDN&gt;[http://companhiadanoticia.com.br/exclusivo-fotos-e-carta-deixadas-pelo-matador-que-protagonizou-um-dia-de-furia-em-sao-goncalo-do-amarante/ Exclusivo: Fotos e carta deixadas pelo matador que protagonizou um dia de fúria em São Gonçalo do Amarante], ''[[Companhia de Notícia]]'' (April 2, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; He owned a grocery store, was married twice and had three children.

According to his friends Ferreira was a man of unpredictable behaviour, who had sudden outbursts of anger, during which he would utter death threats.&lt;ref name=VEJA/&gt; In 1995 he witnessed his son Iuri being run over by a taxi, after which he was said to have changed for the worse.&lt;ref name=FSP2305-1&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/23/cotidiano/1.html Homem assassina 14 e é morto no RN], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 23, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The driver of the taxi was never punished for the accident.&lt;ref name=FSP2305-3&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/23/cotidiano/3.html Para mãe, matador estava 'perturbado'], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 23, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1995 Ferreira and his wife Mônica separated for a month and she moved in with her aunt Maria das Dores Barbalho. According to Barbalho, Mônica told her family that she had decided to leave Ferreira, and to force the separation she invented the story that he was a homosexual, claiming that she had caught him [[In flagrante delicto|in flagrante]] in bed with Edilson Carlos do Nascimento.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_s9AQAAIAAJ&amp;q= Matou 15 para lavar a honra], in ''[[Manchete (magazine)|Manchete]]''; Block Editores, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IST&gt;[http://www.terra.com.br/istoe/politica/144329.htm Fúria e sangue], ''[[ISTOÉ]]'' (May 28, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The rumor spread rapidly in Santo Antônio do Potengi and people, especially his father-in-law Baltazar Jorge de Sá, began talking behind his back about his alleged homosexuality. Ferreira never forgave his wife that she had spread the rumor, and frequently threatened her and her family with murder ever since, whenever they had an argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/24/cotidiano/1.html Assassino planejava matar mais dez], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his brother Genilson, Ferreira stated that after losing his son and his honor of being a man he had nothing to lose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/24/cotidiano/17.html Fama de homossexual surgiu em briga], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; He also related that Ferreira had called a funeral parlour in October 1995 and ordered a coffin for his own funeral, which was never delivered, and also invited some of his friends to dig his grave. When they arrived at his home, they believed he was joking and called police, who then searched his home and seized two handguns and two hundred rounds of ammunition. Ferreira ordered another coffin in February 1997, telling the undertaker he was going to commit suicide, and began laughing when it arrived.&lt;ref name=FSP2305-3/&gt;

For four years Ferreira ran a bar, which he named &quot;Iuri's bar&quot; after his son's death, and was his main source of income, but when it got a reputation of being a haven for homosexuals, his customers began to stay away and it eventually went bankrupt two months prior to the shooting.&lt;ref name=FSP2605&gt;Falência pode ter detonado chacina no RN, ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 26, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; According to police the tavern was a hang-out for drug addicts, where Ferreira, who himself smoked marijuana, dealt with drugs.&lt;ref name=VEJA/&gt; After closing down, Ferreira sold a freezer and other equipment of his bar, using the money to buy arms.&lt;ref name=FSP2605/&gt; When questioned about the sale by a neighbour he replied that he needed the money to make a trip with some friends.

According to his wife's aunt, Ferreira had an altercation with his wife one month prior to shooting, after which she stayed with her parents. During the night Ferreira came to their home, and woke them by yelling that he would kill the whole family, if his wife would not return home. One week later Ferreira told his wife that he was preparing a trip, wishing that he could take her and her whole family with him. About five days prior to the shooting Ferreira told a neighbour that his detractors and debtors would soon get their reward.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-11&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/24/cotidiano/11.html Matador já havia comprado próprio caixão], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferreira's mother Maria related that in the days prior to the shooting he appeared very agitated and restless. Reliving the trauma of his son's death, he became even more upset when he found out the name of the taxi driver responsible for the accident, and constantly talked about taking revenge, of which she tried to dissuade him.&lt;ref name=FSP2305-3/&gt;

==Shooting==
According to his friend Francisco de Assis Ramos dos Santos, 27-year-old Ferreira had planned the murders for over a year&lt;ref name=FSP2405-2&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/24/cotidiano/2.html Acusado de ajudar França nos crimes é preso], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the days prior to the shooting had scouted the area for a place to which he wanted to lure his victims.&lt;ref name=VEJA/&gt; Ferreira also explained his plan to his lover, 16-year-old Valdenice Ribeiro da Silva, about two weeks before the massacre, telling her that he would drive around the city to kill everyone who owed him something, and that he would take her hostage, so she could tell what had happened. Da Silva later said that she did not tell anyone of the plan, because Ferreira had threatened to kill her, if she did.&lt;ref name=IST/&gt; According to da Silva, Ferreira wanted to escape to Coqueiros district after the shooting to watch the repercussions of his crimes on TV, saying: &quot;We are going to be famous, we will appear throughout the country!&quot; (&quot;Nós vamos ser famosos, vamos aparecer no país todo.&quot;) He also hoped to be interviewed by Josimar Gomes da Silva, host of a programme named &quot;Patrulha Policial&quot; that aired on [[TV Ponta Negra]], where he wanted to explain that he was not gay.&lt;ref name=FSP2705&gt;Matador queria ser comparado a Rambo, ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 27, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferreira had a list of about 20 people he wanted to kill, either because they owed him money, or for spreading rumors that he was a homosexual. During his rampage he wore a camouflage vest and was armed with a semi-automatic pistol with two 15-round magazines, as well as a .38-caliber revolver with [[suppressor]], both manufactured by [[Taurus (manufacturer)|Taurus]], and had with him five boxes of ammunition with a total of 250 rounds, a hunting knife and a nylon bag.&lt;ref name=VEJA/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDN/&gt;&lt;ref name=FSP2705/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESP&gt;[http://www.espbr.com/noticias/doze-anos-massacre-virou-filme Doze anos de um massacre que virou filme], ''[[espbr.com]]'' (May 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; During five of the murders Ferreira was assisted by 22-year-old dos Santos, who was holding his victims' hands to their back.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-5&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/24/cotidiano/5.html Assassino planejava matar mais dez], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2bwfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JtgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6482,2922771 Former Brazilian soldier kills 15 in shooting spree], ''[[The Gadsden Times]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 21===
The shooting started on May 21 some time between 16:00 and 18:00 in a remote area near [[São Gonçalo do Amarante, Rio Grande do Norte|São Gonçalo do Amarante]], where Ferreira killed taxi driver Francisco Marques Carneiro, who was dating his ex-wife and made comments about him being a homosexual, with a shot to the forehead.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt; After putting the body in the trunk of the Fiat Palio, Ferreira drove to his friend Francisco de Assis Ramos dos Santos, where he arrived at around 18 o'clock, inviting him, as well as Valdenice Ribeiro da Silva to join him for a ride. Questioned after the murders why they had helped Ferreira and did not seize one of their multiple opportunities to flee, dos Santos and da Silva stated that they were intimidated by the gunman, who threatened to kill them and their families if they tried to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/24/cotidiano/3.html 'Ele ria muito antes de atirar nas vítimas'], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Together they drove to the home of Elias dos Anjos Pimenta in Santo Antônio do Potengi, arriving there at about 19:30. After Pimenta, who owed Ferreira R$10, had joined the trio they drove to Ferreira's father-in-law, Baltazar Jorge de Sá, whom they asked to help with the [[Childbirth|delivery]] of a cow. At a coppice Ferreira ordered his father-in-law and Pimenta to kneel down and shot them dead.&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt;

Ferreira and his two companions subsequently drove to the house of Manoel Brito Marcolino, a farmer with whom Ferreria previously had an argument, in which he demanded that Marcolino should stop spreading rumors about his manhood. They arrived there at approximately 20:30 and asked him to help them buy a shotgun. João Maria Silva de Lima, who was visiting Marcolino, offered to join them. Ferreira eventually killed them both for spreading rumors he was a homosexual.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-5/&gt;

The trio then drove back to Santo Antônio do Potengi and at about 21 o'clock invited Edilson Carlos do Nascimento to a party. Before he too was killed, Ferreira allegedly yelled: &quot;Now I want to see you saying that you screwed me.&quot; (Quero ver agora você dizer por aí que me comeu.)&lt;ref name=IST/&gt; The bodies of Marcolino, de Lima, and Nascimento were later found together in a thicket near Guajiru, a hamlet 2&amp;nbsp;km from Santo Antônio do Potengi, all of them killed with shots to the head and chest. According to dos Santos and da Silva Ferreira laughed frantically while killing them, and asked god for forgiveness afterwards.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-5/&gt;

At about 21:30 Ferreira dumped dos Santos in the city, while he himself, together with da Silva, made his way to his own home, where he arrived between 21:30 and 23:00. There he approached his wife Monica, who was chatting with her brother Erasmo Fidelis de Sá, and shot at her four times, hitting her thrice. Ferreira told de Sá to leave, since he had nothing against him,&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt; and then dictated a letter to da Silva, which he left with his wife's body. Afterwards the couple took Ferreira's 8-month-old son Mateus and brought him to his cousin Maria dos Anjos F. de Souza, telling her that his wife was sick.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-4&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/24/cotidiano/4.html Cronologia], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 24, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FSP2305-8&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/23/cotidiano/8.html França queria matar todos, diz irmã], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 23, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night Ferreira was said to have searched for William Duarte Nobre Junior, coming to his house three times, but due to a breakdown of his truck Nobre did not return home that night.&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt; He also visited several members of his family to say goodbye,&lt;ref name=FSP2305-8/&gt; and told his younger sister Hosana that he was on a mission.&lt;ref name=VEJA/&gt;

===May 22===
The next day, at about 6 o'clock, the couple arrived at the home of Ferreira's parents, José Ferreira and Maria do Carmo. Ferreira took them to the backyard of their house, pointed his weapons at them, and threatened them with murder. Upon his brother Genilson's question why he wanted to kill them, Ferreira replied that he didn't want his family to suffer for what he was doing, though before he was able to put his intentions into practice military police sergeant Francisco de Assis Bezerra and soldier Ilton de Lima Ciríaco, who were searching for the gunman, arrived at the scene. Ferreira fired shots at them, fatally hitting Bezerra twice in the head, and wounding Ciríaco in the shoulder.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-5/&gt;&lt;ref name=FSP2305-2&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/23/cotidiano/2.html Cronologia], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 23, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferreira, apparently abandoning his plan to kill his parents, returned to the home of his father-in-law, where he and da Silva arrived at 6:30, to search for de Sá's two daughters, who were already at school at that time. After killing his mother-in-law Tereza Carlos Ribeiro, Ferreira drove to the house of his ex-wife Maria Valdete Rafael da Costa, just 200m away, and killed her, as well as her mother Francisca Neide Rafael da Costa, when she tried to help her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/23/cotidiano/22.html Matador convidava vítimas para o ajudar], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 23, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; He then took his 5-year-old daughter Nayara (or Gislaine according to other sources)&lt;ref name=VEJA/&gt; and walked back to his own home, leaving the car behind.

Ferreira and da Silva arrived at their destination at 6:45, and while they were searching the neighbourhood for a man named Aruanã, whom Ferreira also suspected of spreading rumours about his alleged homosexuality, they came across his neighbour Flávio Silva de Oliveira, who was a mute and asleep. Ferreira killed Oliveira, allegedly because he had once made hand gestures indicating that Ferreira had a sexual preference for men,&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt; and also shot dead truck driver Fernando Correia de Souza in front of the house.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-5/&gt;

At 7:30 Antônio Josemberg Campelo, a messenger of [[Oi (telecommunications)|Telern]] who had earlier witnessed the murder of sergeant Bezerra and also cast doubt on Ferreira's sexuality,&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt; was killed by Ferreira in the street with seven shots. By that time Ferreira was chased by about 120 police officers, who were more and more closing in on him.&lt;ref name=IST/&gt; He escaped police by hiding in a school and several homes, whose inhabitants he threatened with murder,&lt;ref name=FSP2305-2/&gt; until 12:10 when he was finally surrounded in a banana plantation near a ceramic tile factory just 2&amp;nbsp;km from his home.&lt;ref name=FSP2305-1/&gt; After letting da Silva and his daughter go, Ferreira shot himself in the chest with his revolver and engaged in a shootout with police, until he eventually died of his self-inflicted wound.&lt;ref name=FSP2405-4/&gt; Police afterward fired shots at his head until it was unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=VEJA/&gt; Besides his guns he still had 104 rounds of unspent ammunition and the knife in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1997/5/23/cotidiano/5.html Homem mata 14 pessoas em 22 horas], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' (May 23, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

|The reason I am writing these few lines is not to justify the wrong I have done, but it is only in this way that I can prove to the entire world, and can challenge those who wanted to prove that I was a homosexual, I was not, nor am I going to be [a homosexual] because of this claim, which is the reason for this tragedy. I don't feel like a normal person, after these lies have been told about me.

Here I write my final words, they may say I went crazy so I recommend everyone's souls to God.

And I hope God will forgive me for what I did, but it was my only solution. I hope this letter will be sent to J. Gomes, so he can disclose it to the public, and it may advise everyone not to bear false witness against other people.

I stop here because I can't go on.

I wish everybody a life in dignity which I had not.

I may even fail to avenge the death of my son, if I'm not able to do so.

It was difficult to live unaccepted in society, because of a single [[caboclo]] who told lies about me but now is dead.

I beg forgiveness from all who try to understand me. I did not do it for fun, but was forced to.

Still going on I leave a strong hug and a kiss to all my family, and my whole family no matter the religion, but let them all get together, and create a strong chain of prayer so that God may take care of my soul.

GOODBYE

TO

EVERYONE

|O motido deu escrever estas poucas linhas, não é pra justificar o erro que eu fiz, mais só assim eu consegueria provar pra todo mundo, e deixo o desafio pra qualquer um que queira provar que eu era homo-sexual, nem eu era, nem vou ser por esse comentário foi que aconteceu toda essa tragédia eu não me sinto como pessoa normal depois desse falso que levantaram contra minha pessoa.

Aqui eu escrevo minhas palavras finais, Poderam dizer que eu fiquei louco mais mesmo assim eu recomendo a alma de todos para Deus.

E espero que Deus me perdoe por esse ato que eu fiz, mais era minha única solução. eu espero que essa carta seja enviada para J. Gomes para que ele divulgue para o público, e que aconselhe a todos a não levantar falsos do seu próximo.

Paro aqui porque não tenho mais condições.

Para todos desejo uma vida de dignidade a qual não tive.

Eu posso até não vingar a morte do meu filho se não tiver condições.

Tava difício viver não aceito na sociedade pelo simples caboclo que me levantou um falso mais agora está morto.

Eu imploro perdão de todos que tentam me compreender. eu não fiz esto por prazer fiz forçado.

Ainda continuando deixo um forte abraço e um beijo pra toda minha família, e que toda minha família não emporta a religião, más que todos se reúnam e construam uma forte corrente de oração para que Deus tome conta de minha alma.

ADEUS

PARA

TODOS

* '''Ganbar [[Missile]]''' &lt;br&gt; It fires a missile form the trunk on the [[shield]]
* '''Ganbar Slugger''' &lt;br&gt; It throws an energy [[boomerang]] created from the [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] on the head

The first of the two [[reinforcements]]. Its transforming command is '''&quot;{{nihongo|Miracle Change|ミラクル変形|Mirackuru Henkei}}&quot;''', as opposed to the '''&quot;Miracle Change&quot;''' of the previous robots(although later on they do use Miracle Change for it a few times). Its pilot is Red Ganbare, and the [[cockpit]] is close to what Rikiya is used to in King Elephant. It launches from underneath a [[railroad]] crossing. In beast mode it can use its [[claws]] and [[teeth]] to attack, as well as [[fire]] shots form the [[tail]], and in robot mode it has:
* '''Head Bomber''' &lt;br&gt; It fires shots from the &quot;[[revolver]]&quot; in the head
* '''Shot Blaster''' &lt;br&gt; It fires blasts from its [[rifle]]

=== {{nihongo|RevolBuster|リボルバスター|Riborubasutaa}} ===
The [[gun]] mode. When the command '''&quot;Miracle Bussou&quot;'''is given, it transforms into a huge [[double-barrel gun]]. This mode is called the RevolBuster, and used for the finisher RevolBuster Last Fire.

Gekiryuger is the last of the reinforcements, granted to Yuusuke. Besides its [[natural]] [[weapons]] it can fire shots from the tailguns(Back Shot) and duplicate the tornado that Mach Eagle creates(Gekiryu Hurricane). After it transforms with Miracle Henkei(and also Change later):
* '''Dragon Shot''' &lt;br&gt; It summons and fires shots form its handheld [[rifle]]
* '''Gekiryu [[Cannon]]''' &lt;br&gt; The first part of the major attack(and sometimes finisher). It summons two over-the-shoulder cannons and starts charging an energy blast between them.
* '''[[Dragon]] [[Thunder]] Crash''' &lt;br&gt; The second part of the major attack. It launches the generated [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] ball at the enemy with a blast from the dragon head on the chest.
* There is also a nameless energy [[boomerang]] launched from the head crest.
* It can also join hands with Revolger and Ganbaruger for a team attack and part-time finisher called Ultra Ganbare Ninpo. They become a [[wheel]] of flame and roll through the enemy.

The final form. The main [[torso]] is Ganbaruger, though Revolger adds onto it, and forms the [[head]], and lower [[arm]]s at least. Gekiryuger becomes the [[leg]]s, and [[wing]]s. Its attacks are:
* '''Ganbar [[Breast]] Flash''' &lt;br&gt; It fires an energy blast shaped like the symbol on its chest from its chest at the enemy.
* '''Final Ganbar [[Sword]]''' &lt;br&gt; It summons the sword from a pillar of light between earth and sky. Note: It seems as if it can barely handle the weight of the sword!
* '''Great Final Attack''' &lt;br&gt; The finishing move, firing an electric blast form the sword to immobilize the enemy, then jet forward and slash it in half.
* It can also swap the [[hand]] for a [[cannon]] and [[fire]] in a nameless attack.

'''Gennady Modestovich Mikhasevich''' ({{lang-be|Генадзь Мадэставіч Міхасевіч}}; 7 April, 1947 – 25 September, 1987) was a Soviet [[serial killer]]. He murdered 36&lt;ref&gt;http://crynews.ru/persprint/553.html&lt;/ref&gt; women during the period from 1971 to 1985 in [[Vitebsk]], [[Polotsk]] and the rural areas in the nearby regions of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]].

== Biography ==
Gennady Mikhasevich was born in the village of Ist ([[Vitebsk Oblast]]) in 1947,&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton_177&quot;&gt;Newton, Michael (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq= ''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'']. Infobase Publishing. p. 177. ISBN 0816069875.&lt;/ref&gt; and served in the army. He committed his first murder on 14 May 1971. He himself later explained that the killing spree started after he had returned from the army only to find out that his girlfriend had left him and got married in the meantime. On the night of 14 May 1971, he was on his way from [[Vitebsk]] to [[Polotsk]]. It was late so he could not catch a bus to Polotsk where his parents lived. Mikhasevich reported he was feeling despondent because of the breakup with his girlfriend and had prepared a loop to [[suicide|hang himself]]. However, he accidentally met a young woman on the road. He decided to kill her, venting his anger on her. He murdered again in October, 1971, and strangled two other women in 1972, near Vitebsk. Mikhasevich graduated from a technical school in Vitebsk in 1973 and returned to Ist, starting to work in a [[sovkhoz]]. He got married in 1976. In the meantime, the murders went on.  

Many of his murders coincided with [[rape]]. He either strangled or smothered his victims, either assaulting them in solitary locations or (during later years) after having lured them into his own car (he possessed a red [[Zaporozhets]]) or the machines of his workplace (he later had a job in machine repair service). Mikhasevich did not carry weapons, instead he used improvised means (e.g. a cord made of [[rye]]). Besides killing, he robbed his victims of money and valuable items (that he would sometimes give to his wife as a gift), and sometimes even of household items like scissors. 

In outward appearance, Gennady Mikhasevich was a good family man, a [[teetotaller]], had two children, was a conscientious worker; he was also member of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]] (also served as a local party functionary) and of [[Voluntary People's Druzhina]].

The investigation started to advance in the 1980s, as the young investigator Nikolay Ignatovich firmly stood up for the idea that all the killings of females near motorways in the region were committed by one person, a [[serial killer]], not separate murderers, as the investigators had conveniently presumed. The police also suspected that the serial killer was using a red Zaporozhets; as they started checking all the people of the Oblast, who possessed such a car, Mikhasevich [[Voluntary People's Druzhina|as a druzhinnik]] participated in these actions, in a way searching for himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton_177&quot;/&gt; This also enabled him to learn of the steps the investigators were taking beforehand. The year 1985 was especially 'prolific' for the murderer: he killed 12 women in this year alone. 

Eventually, Mikhasevich, who was now getting concerned, made a fatal mistake: in order to derail the investigation, he sent an anonymous letter to the local newspaper on behalf of an imaginary underground organization 'Patriots of Vitebsk', supposedly calling on his fellow militants to intensify their struggle of killing communists and lewd women. When he left a similar hand-written note next to his new victim, again signed on behalf of 'Patriots of Vitebsk', the investigators started to ascertain the handwritings of the male residents of the Oblast. Having checked 556,000 samples, the experts detected that the sample with the handwriting of Gennady Modestovich Mikhasevich had striking resemblance with the handwriting on the murderer's notes. Further investigation revealed other evidence, convincing them of Mikhasevich's guilt. 

He was finally arrested in December 1985, after initial denial, he confessed and was sentenced to death and executed in 1987. His case became notorious in the USSR (“The Vitebsk Case” (“Витебское дело”)), as it revealed both the incompetence of the police and the corruption of the [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]]: by the time Mikhasevich was finally arrested, 14 people had already been convicted for the crimes Mikhasevich committed, the suspects had been often forced to confess by torture, and a couple of them had been sentenced to death and executed for the crimes they did not commit.

'''Gennaro Rubino''' (November 23, 1859&lt;ref name=&quot;milillo1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Stefano|last=Milillo|year=2006|title=Gennaro Rubino e l'attentato a Leopoldo II re del Belgio|journal=Studi Bitontini|issue=80|pages=90|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources report Rubino's date of birth as November 24, 1859, due to a discrepancy in the birth records of the city of Bitonto. The original baptism record, however, records the date as November 23.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; March 14, 1918; also spelled '''Rubini''') was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[anarchism|anarchist]] who unsuccessfully tried to assassinate [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] of [[Belgium]].

==Early life==
Rubino was born in [[Bitonto]], during the period of [[Italian unification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;milillo1&quot;/&gt; While serving in the Italian army as a young man, Rubino was condemned to five years' detention for writing a subversive newspaper article.&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The Attempt on the Belgian King |work=The Scotsman |date=November 17, 1902|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, he was arrested again during bread riots in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;Milillo, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than serving a lengthy prison sentence, Rubino fled the country. He first took up residence in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] and then moved to [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Milillo, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to find work, however, until offered assistance by the Italian Embassy. He was then employed by the Italian Secret Service to spy on anarchist organizations in London. He was dismissed from the job, however, once embassy officials discovered that he sympathized with the anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=King of the Belgians Attacked by Anarchist |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06EEDA1E3DEE32A25755C1A9679D946397D6CF |work=The New York Times |date=November 16, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Attempt on the King of the Belgians |work=The Scotsman |date=November 17, 1902|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1902, Rubino's employment with the Italian Secret Service was uncovered, and he was denounced by the international anarchist press as a spy. Evidently, Rubino then resolved to commit an assassination in order to prove his allegiance to the anarchist cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=King Leopold's Escape |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02E4DC1E30E132A25754C1A9679D946397D6CF |work=The New York Times |date=November 17, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he wrote in a letter to his former comrades, &quot;perhaps tomorrow or after, I will be able to prove my rebellion in a manner more consistent with my and your aspirations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Milillo, 97. Original Italian: &quot;E forse domani o dopo, potrò dimostrare la mia ribellione in un modo più consono alle mie e vostre aspirazioni.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to later police interrogations, he considered killing [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], but decided against it due to the strong feeling of the English people in favour&lt;!--Not favor please as the context is British, not American--&gt; of the monarchy. Instead he chose King Leopold II of Belgium.&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The Brussels Anarchist |work=The Scotsman |date=November 18, 1902|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination attempt==
In late October, 1902, Rubino relocated to [[Brussels]]. On the morning of November 15, 1902, King Leopold was returning from a ceremony in memory of his recently deceased wife, [[Marie Henriette of Austria|Marie Henriette]].

The royal cortege left the cathedral; in the first carriage Prince Albert was seated with the king, and in the second carriage princess Elisabeth was seated.

Rubino took a revolver and waited for the King's procession among a crowd on the [[Rue Royale, Brussels|Rue Royale]] in front of the Bank of Brussels. After Leopold's carriage passed, Rubino drew his gun and fired three shots at the third carriage. In this carriage Count [[Charles John d'Oultremont]], the Grand Marshal of the Royal court was seated, and he received broken glass in his face. The carriages didn't stop and continued to the palace. When he arrived in the royal palace, the Grand Marshal was questioned by officials. His uniform was covered in broken glass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meuse La 17-11-1902&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Attentat contre le roi des Belges|work=La Meuse|date=November 17, 1902|pages=1–2|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal De Charleroi 16-11-1902&lt;/ref&gt; The king and members of the royal family were told that they had escaped an assassination attempt. The king asked if anybody had been hurt and then continued his day.

All three shots missed, although one smashed the window of a carriage of Count Charles d'Oultremont, who was almost killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman2&quot;/&gt;
The king was saved by M. J. Bernard from Bar-le-duc who successfully disarmed Rubino. Bernard received in 1903 by Royal decree the Civique medal, first class.&lt;ref&gt;Meuse (La) 25-07-1903&lt;/ref&gt; Paul van den Bosch, from Liege, caught Rubino by his throat and handed him to the police. Both went to the office of police to be interrogated by General Willmaers, officer of police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meuse La 17-11-1902&quot;/&gt;

Rubino was immediately apprehended by the crowd and then rescued by police and put in a cab. The infuriated crowd surrounded the cab and attacked the vehicle with knives and sticks. The police had great difficulty in forcing their way through the crowd, which shouted alternately, &quot;Kill him!&quot; and &quot;Long live the King!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;/&gt;

At the police station, Rubino was searched and found to be carrying a package of ball cartridges and picture postcards bearing portraits of King Leopold, [[Albert I of Belgium|Prince Albert]], and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876-1965)|Princess Elisabeth]]. Rubino said he procured the cards so he would be able to recognize the members of the royal family. He also said he did not regret his act and would have fired &quot;at the King of Italy as readily as at the King of Belgium, because monarchs are tyrants who cause the misery of their peoples.&quot; He also asserted that he had no accomplices, although several people who were near Rubino when he fired the revolver asserted that he was accompanied by another man who escaped among the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;/&gt;

Following the attempted assassination, anarchists further condemned Rubino as an [[agent provocateur]], with some even speculating that the entire event was staged in order to justify subsequent police crackdowns against European anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ross|last=Winn|date=January 1903|title=Editorial Comment|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Editorial_Comment|journal=Winn's Firebrand|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speculation was fueled by early reports that the unfired cartridges left in Rubino's revolver were [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Shots Fired at King of the Belgians|work=Nashville Banner|date=November 15, 1902|quote=The other chambers in the revolver proved to be blank, so it is presumed that those fired were equally harmless.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was contradicted by later reports that Rubino's revolver was never found by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=King of the Belgians Attacked by Anarchist |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C06EEDA1E3DEE32A25755C1A9679D946397D6CF |work=The New York Times |date=November 16, 1902 |quote=It is thought possible that this individual was an accomplice who carried off the revolver which the police have not yet found.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milillo, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
After the attempt he was sent to the prison of Saint Gilles, where he received three glasses of beer for dinner and some bread.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meuse La 17-11-1902&quot;/&gt; He was questioned by the Examining magistrate M. J. Count d'Oultremont. Rubino chose [[Emile Royer]] (1866-1916), a socialist Chamber of Representatives member as his lawyer.

There was an issue: because the grand Marshall of the royal Court count Charles d'Oultremont was related to Examining magistrate M. J. d'Oultremont, he had to be replaced by Mr. van Nerom to respect a neutral examination.&lt;ref&gt;Meuse (La) 19-11-1902&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubino stood trial in [[Brussels]] in February 1903. At the trial Rubino was unrepentant and even boastful, declaring that he had hoped to be able to kill the King, Prince Albert, and a few of the clergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Anarchist Rubino on Trial |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CEEDE1130E733A25754C0A9649C946297D6CF |work=The New York Times |date=February 7, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial Rubino often expounded [[anarchist]] doctrines which, he said, recognized neither laws nor judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trail of an Anarchist |work=The Scotsman |date=February 7, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury found Rubino guilty and the court then sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt4&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Life Sentence for Anarchist |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04E2DD1130E733A25752C1A9649C946297D6CF |work=The New York Times |date=February 11, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Trial of Rubino |work=The Scotsman |date=February 11, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Rubino died on March 14, 1918 in Leuven Centraal, the main prison of [[Leuven]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Milillo, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda''' ({{lang-ru|Ге́нрих Григо́рьевич Яго́да}}; 7 November 1891&amp;ndash;15 March 1938), born '''Yenokh Gershevich Iyeguda''' ({{lang-ru|Енох Гершевич Иегуда}}) was a Soviet-Russian  [[secret police]] official who served as director of the [[NKVD]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s security and intelligence agency, from 1934 to 1936. Appointed by [[Joseph Stalin]], Yagoda supervised the arrest, [[Moscow Show Trial|show trial]], and execution of the [[Old Bolshevik]]s [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], events that initiated the [[Great Purge]]. Yagoda also supervised the construction of the [[White Sea–Baltic Canal]] with [[Naftaly Frenkel]], using slave labor from the [[GULAG]] system, during which many laborers died.

Like many Soviet secret policemen of the 1930s, Yagoda himself was ultimately a victim of the Purge. He was demoted from the directorship of the NKVD in favor of [[Nikolai Yezhov]] in 1936 and arrested in 1937. Charged with the crimes of [[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], espionage, [[Trotskyism]] and conspiracy, Yagoda was a defendant at the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet &quot;Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites&quot;|Trial of the Twenty-One]], the last of the major Soviet show trials of the 1930s. Following his confession at the trial, Yagoda was found guilty and shot.

==Early life==
[[File:1912 genrich jagoda kartei orchrana.jpg|thumb|left|Yagoda on police information card from 1912]]
Yagoda was born in [[Rybinsk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genrikh Yagoda|website=http://spartacus-educational.com/RUSyagoda.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a [[Jewish]] family. The son of a jeweller, trained as a statistician, who worked as a chemist's assistant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montefiore|first1=Simon Sebag|title=Stalin, The Court of the Red Tsar|date=2004|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=0 75381 766 7|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed that he was an active revolutionary from the age of 14, when he worked as a compositor on an underground printing press in [[Nizhni-Novgorod]], and that at the age of 15 he was a member of a fighting squad in the Sormovo district of Nizhi-Novgorod, during the violent suppression of the [[1905 revolution]]. One of his brothers was killed during the fighting in Sormovo; the other was shot for taking part in a mutiny in a regiment during the war with Germany. He said he joined the Bolsheviks in Nizhni-Novgorod at the age of 16 or 17, and was arrested and sent into exile in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Case of the Anti Soviet Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites, Verbatim Report|date=1938|publisher=People's Commissariat of Justice of the U.S.S.R.|location=Moscow|page=784|last1=See Yagoda's last plea at his trial in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his arrest, he married Ida Averbakh, one of whose uncles, Yakov Sverdlov, was a prominent Bolshevik, and another, Zinovy Peshkov, was the adopted son of the writer Maxim Gorky. In 1913, he moved to St Petersburg to work at the Putilov steel works. After the outbreak of war, he joined the army, and was wounded in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Бажанов|first1=Борис|last2=Кривицкий|first2=Вальтер|last3=Орлов|first3=Александр|title=Ягода.

There is another version of his early career, told in the memoirs of the former NKVD officer [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov|Aleksandr M. Orlov]], who alleged that Yagoda invented his early revolutionary career and did not join the Bolsheviks until 1917, and that his deputy [[Mikhail Trilisser]] was dismissed from the service for trying to expose the lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Alexander|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be assumed that this was gossip put around by Yagoda's successors after his fall from power.

== Political career ==
After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Yagoda rose rapidly through the ranks of the ''[[Cheka]]'' (the predecessor of the OGPU and  [[NKVD]]) to become the second deputy of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], the head of the Cheka, in September 1923. After Dzerzhinsky's appointment as chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy in January 1924, Yagoda became the real manager of the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|State Political Directorate]] (OGPU), as the deputy chairman [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]] had little authority because of his serious illness. In 1924, he joined the USSR's head of government, [[Alexei Rykov]] on a ship tour of the Volga. An American journalist who was allowed to join them on the trip described Yagoda as &quot;a spare, slightly-tanned, trim looking, youngish officer&quot; adding that it was &quot;difficult to associate terror with the affable and modest person&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I Dreamt Revolution|last=Reswick|first=William|publisher=Henry Regnery Company|year=1952|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the chemist [[Vladimir Ipatieff]] met Yagoda briefly in Moscow in 1918 and thought that &quot;it was unusual for a young men in his early twenties to be so unpleasant. I felt then that it would be unlucky for me or anyone else ever to fall into his hands.&quot; When he saw him again in 1927, &quot;his appearance had changed considerably: he had grown fatter and looked much older and very dignified and important.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of a Chemist: Memoirs of Vladimir Ipatieff|last=Ipatieff|first=Vladimir|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1946|isbn=|location=Stanford, Ca|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Yagoda appears to have known [[Joseph Stalin]] since 1918, when they were both stationed in [[Tsaritsyn]] during the civil war, &quot;he was never Stalin's man&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stalin, The Court of the Red Tsar|last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|publisher=Phoenix|year=2004|isbn=0 75381 766 7|location=London|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Stalin ordered that the Soviet Union entire rural population were to be forced onto collective farms, Yagoda is reputed to have sympathised with Bukharin and Rykov his opponents on the right of the communist party, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] claimed in a leaked private conversation in July 1928 that &quot;Yagoda and Trilisser are with us&quot;, but once it became apparent that the right was losing the power struggle, Yagoda switched allegiance. In the contemptuous opinion of Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, Yagoda &quot;traded his personal views for the sake of his career&quot; and degenerated into a &quot;criminal&quot; and a &quot;miserable coward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This I Cannot Forget|last=Larina|first=Anna|publisher=Pandora|year=1993|isbn=0 04 440887 0|location=London|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1922 exit visa hand signed by Genrikh Yagoda..jpg|thumb|1922 exit visa hand signed by Genrikh Yagoda in Moscow.]]
Yagoda continued to be effective head of the OGPU until July 1931, when the little known Old Bolshevik [[Ivan Akulov]] was appointed First Deputy Chairman, and Yagoda was demoted to the post of Second Deputy. Akulov was dismissed and Yagoda reinstated in October 1932, After Yagoda's fall, one of his former colleagues confessed: &quot;We met Akulov with violent hostility...the entire party organisation in the OGPU was devoted to sabotaging Akulov.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I Was Stalin's Agent|last=Krivitsly|first=W.G.|publisher=The Right Book Club|year=1940|isbn=|location=London|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin must have agreed to his reinstatement with ill grace, because four years later he accused the OGPU/NKVD of being &quot;four years behind&quot; in rooting out the supposed Trotskyite anti-Soviet conspiracy, although Yagoda had been complicit in the execution of one of Trotsky's sympathisers, [[Yakov Blumkin]], and in sending others to the [[GULAG]], the system of forced labour created under his supervision. 

As deputy head of the OGPU, Yagoda organized the building of the [[White Sea–Baltic Canal]] using [[forced labor]] at breakneck speed between 1931 and 1933 at the cost of huge casualties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulag.eu/GULAG/Storm.html Gulag, The Storm projects - The White Sea Canal], ''Gulag.eu''. Retrieved 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For his contribution to the canal's construction he was later awarded the [[Order of Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,745910,00.html Russia: Canal Heroes], ''[[Time Magazine]]''; 14 August 1933. Retrieved 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the [[Moscow-Volga Canal]] was also started under his watch, but only completed after his fall by his successor [[Nikolai Yezhov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758021,00.html Russia: Stalin's Mercy]; ''Time Magazine''; 26 July 1937. Retrieved on 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He also supervised{{fact|date=August 2016}} the deportations, confiscations, mass arrests and executions that accompanied the forced collectivisation, which he reputedly opposed at the outset. The death toll is estimated to have been as high as seven million.{{fact|date=August 2016}} In Ukraine, this catastrophe is known as Holodomor. In March 1934, he was rewarded by being made a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Almost the first case Yagoda dealt with after the death of his nominal boss, Menzhinsky, on 10 May 1934, was that of the poet [[Osip Mandelstam]], who had composed an epigram attacking Stalin and had recited it to trusted friends, one of whom informed on him. Bukharin visited Yagoda to intercede for Mandelstam, unaware of the nature of his offence. According to Mandelstam's widow: &quot;Yagoda liked M.'s poem so much that he even learned it by heart - he recited it to Bukharin - but he would not have hesitated to destroy the whole of literature, past, present and future, if he had thought it to his advantage. For people of this extraordinary type, human blood is like water.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hope Against Hope, A Memoir|last=Mandelstam|first=Nadezha (translated by Max Hayward)|publisher=Collins &amp; Harvill|year=1971|isbn=0 00 262501 6|location=London|pages=82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, Menzhinsky's death was followed one day later by that Max Peshkov, the son of [[Maxim Gorky]], the doyen of Soviet literature. Yagoda had been cultivating Gorky as a potentially useful contact since 1928, and employed Gorky's secretary, Pyotr Kryuchkov, as a spy. &quot;Whenever Gorky met Stalin or other members of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], Yagoda would visit Kryuchkov's flat afterward, demanding a full account of what had been said. He took to visiting public baths with Kryuchkov. One day in 1932, Yagoda handed his valuable spy $4,000 to buy a car.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fear and the Muse Kept Watch, The Russian Masters - from Akhmatov and Pasternak to Shostakovich and Eisenstein - Under Stalin|last=McSmith|first=Andy|publisher=The New Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-59558-056-6|location=New York|pages=91|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also developed an obsession with Max Peshkov's wife, Timoshka, and visited her daily when she was newly-widowed, though her mother denied that they were ever lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fear and the Muse Kept Watch|last=McSmith|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=92|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Involvement in the Holodomor===
Yagoda is held responsible for his service in the implementation of Stalin's policies that caused the deaths of 2.4 to 7.5 million soviet people during the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukemonde.com/genocide/margolisholocaust.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agnieszka Bieńczyk-Missala, Sławomir Dębski (2010).

===NKVD Chief===
[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Yagoda (middle) inspecting the construction of the Moscow-Volga canal. Behind him is [[Nikita Khrushchev]].]]

Yagoda, as an NKVD official, would have been involved with the seizures or blockades of food, tools, etc., and the movement of inhabitants. Though people elsewhere in the Soviet Union died from hunger in 1932 and 1933, the authorities in Ukraine went much further by quarantining and starving the population. On the basis of performances in that famine he was promoted in 1934 to a full-fledged member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LEVY|first1=CLIFFORD|title=A New View of a Famine That Killed Millions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/world/europe/16kiev.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 August 2016|date=15 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 1934, two months after Menzhinsky's death, Joseph Stalin appointed Yagoda [[People's Commissar]] for Internal Affairs, a position that included the oversight of both the regular and the secret police, the [[NKVD]]. Yagoda worked closely with [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] in organizing the first [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Show Trial]], which resulted in the prosecution and subsequent execution of former Soviet politicians Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in August 1936 as part of Stalin's [[Great Purge]]. The [[Red Army]] high command was not spared and its ranks were thinned by Yagoda, as a precursor to the later and more extensive [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|purge in the Russian military]]. More than a quarter of a million people were arrested during the 1934–1935 period; the GULAG system was vastly expanded under his stewardship, and slave labor became a major developmental resource in the Soviet economy.

Stalin became increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda's performance. In the middle of 1936, Stalin received a report from Yagoda detailing the unfavorable public reaction abroad to the show trials and the growing sympathy among the Soviet population for the executed defendants. The report enraged Stalin, interpreting it as Yagoda's advice to stop the show trials and in particular to abandon the planned purge of [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] and the former commander in chief of the Red Army. Stalin was already unhappy with Yagoda's services, mostly due to the mismanagement of Kirov's assassination and his failure to fabricate &quot;proofs&quot; of ties between Kamenev and Zinoviev and the [[Okhrana]] (the tsarist security organization).&lt;ref&gt;Brackman, Roman., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nA7YzQMzO9YC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=stalin+telegram+to+politburo+genrikh+yagoda&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0ZVeTpHDDcjjrAf6lfSxDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=stalin%20telegram%20to%20politburo%20genrikh%20yagoda&amp;f=false The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life]'', London: Frank Cass Publishers (2001), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; As one Soviet official put it, &quot;The Boss forgets nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), pp. 295-296&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 25 September 1936, Stalin sent a telegram (co-signed by [[Andrei Zhdanov]]) to the members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. The telegram read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We consider it absolutely necessary and urgent that Comrade Yezhov be appointed to head the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs. ''Yagoda has obviously proved unequal to the task of exposing the Trotskyite-Zinovievite bloc.'' The [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] was four years late in this matter. All party heads and the most of the NKVD agents in the region are talking about this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Medvedev, Roy., ''Let History Judge'', New York (1971), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A day later, he was replaced by Yezhov, who managed the main purges during 1937–1938. Yagoda was demoted to the post of [[People's Commissariat for Post and Telegraph|People's Commissar for Post and Telegraph]].

===Arrest, trial, and execution===
In March 1937, Yagoda was arrested on Stalin's orders. [[Yezhov]] announced Yagoda's arrest for diamond smuggling, corruption, and spying for [[Germany]] since joining the party in 1917. Yezhov even sprinkled [[mercury (element)|mercury]] around his office, then blamed it on Yagoda as an attempt to assassinate him. It was discovered that Yagoda's two Moscow apartments and his [[dacha]] contained 3,904 [[Pornographic photography|pornographic photos]], 11 [[pornographic film]]s, 165 pornographic pipes, one [[dildo]] and the two bullets that killed Zinoviev and Kamenev.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=195}} Yezhov took over the apartments. He had spent four million [[roubles]] decorating his three homes, boasting that his garden had &quot;2,000 orchids and roses.&quot;{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=85}}

Yagoda was found guilty of [[treason]] and [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against the Soviet government at the Trial of the Twenty-One in March 1938. Unlike some of the other defendants, he put up resistance in the dock. In particular, he denied a charge that he had had Max Peshkov murdered in order to have an affair with his widow. He scored a victory by getting the court to go into private session to deal with the alleged murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet 'Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites'|publisher=People's Commissariat of Justice of the USSR|year=1938|location=Moscow|pages=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]] describes Yagoda as trusting in deliverance from Stalin even during the show trial itself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just as though Stalin had been sitting right there in the hall, Yagoda confidently and insistently begged him directly for mercy: &quot;I appeal to you! ''For you'' I built two [[White Sea-Baltic Canal|great]] [[Moscow-Volga Canal|canals]]!&quot; And a witness reports that at just that moment a match flared in the shadows behind a window on the second floor of the hall, apparently behind a muslin curtain, and, while it lasted, the outline of a pipe could be seen.&lt;ref&gt;See Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. ''The Gulag Archipelago'' Vol I–II, Harper &amp; Row, 1973, ISBN 0-06-013914-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yagoda was summarily shot soon after the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsru.com/russia/24jun2010/beria.html Лаврентия Берию в 1953 году расстрелял лично советский маршал]&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Ida Averbakh was also executed in 1938. In 1988, on the 50th anniversary of the trial, the Soviet authorities belatedly cleared all of the other 20 defendants of any criminal offence, admitting that the entire trial was built on false confessions. Yagoda was the only defendant not to be posthumously rehabilitated.

'''Gentleman Ghost''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] published by [[DC Comics]] publications.

==Publication history==
Gentleman Ghost first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #88 (October 1947) and was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Joe Kubert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Gentleman Ghost | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 137 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
&quot;Gentleman Ghost&quot; '''Jim Craddock''' is the son of an English gentleman who abandoned both Jim and his mother, forcing them into poverty. Craddock grew up to become a notorious [[highwayman]] and robber who terrorized [[England]] in the 19th century, after a prophecy from a gypsy said he would be a highwayman. He encountered the ghosts of other highwaymen and [[Dick Turpin]] left him a horse. He journeys to the [[United States]] and encounters the [[gunslinger]]s [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]] and [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]]. The hot-headed Nighthawk lynches Craddock after wrongly assuming that he sexually assaulted Cinnamon, but Craddock somehow eludes death to rise again as a [[Ghost|phantom]].

The Gentleman Ghost learns he must wander the earth until the [[spirit]] of his killer moves on to the next [[plane (metaphysics)|plane of existence]]. Unfortunately, Nighthawk and Cinnamon turn out to be the [[reincarnation]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian royalty Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara: their [[soul]]s (due to their exposure to the [[Thanagar]]ian [[Nth metal]]) can never truly pass on. Both are eventually resurrected as [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]], and the Gentleman Ghost becomes their recurring nemesis during the 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; Craddock has over the decades menaced other heroes, including [[Batman]], [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[The New Teen Titans]], [[Max Mercury]] and [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]], but the [[vengeful ghost]] always returns to his main foes, the Hawks, sometimes as a foe and sometimes as a friend.

Gentleman Ghost has clashed with [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] on different occasions. In ''JSA Classified'', issues 5-7, the Gentleman Ghost is a member of the [[Injustice Society]]. In ''[[Villains United]]'' #1, he joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

His origin is explored and altered in the pages of ''JSA'' #82-87 (2006). The [[Legitimacy (law)|natural]] son of an abusive father and a poor mother, young Jim Craddock soon slips into a life of crime, making contacts with the supernatural. After a [[Romani people|gypsy]] prophesizes that he will be able to transcend death and return to life fighting and killing his enemies on English soil, his villainous career is put to an end when he is captured and sentenced to death by hanging after he is tricked by a woman he is trying to seduce who summons Redcoats. Returning as a ghost, he battles the JSA, hoping for the prophecy to come true.

The Ghost is briefly seen in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', during the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]]' attack on Metropolis and its dozens of superpowered and human defenders. Afterwards, the Ghost becomes involved in a fight with [[Alan Scott]]. This ends badly for Scott, leaving him in a coma.

When the rightful time arrives, the Ghost gains the additional power of summoning vengeful ghosts from his enemies' (the JSA) past, like someone Scott accidentally killed with an electrical accident, although this is a fake, and other highwaymen. His plan is foiled by [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]], who, as a [[virginity|virgin]] girl, is impervious to ghostly attacks, an army of ghostly nobles who attack his army, and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], surprisingly a descendant of the Royal House of England, who decapitates him. Vanquished, he disappears.

Gentleman Ghost is seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Gentleman Ghost is still a thief but no longer a ghost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gotham By Midnight Annual #1&quot;&gt;''Gotham By Midnight Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; In his first appearance, he steals the Mortis Orb, which has the power to resurrect the dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Hawkman'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkman deduces that Gentleman Ghost is Jim Craddock and Gentleman Ghost confirms it. Gentleman Ghost tells Hawkman he invited him here because the Nth metal drew him to the Mortis Orb. Then, he tells Hawkman he will take him to the orb, but Hawkman refuses, so Gentleman Ghost sends more apparitions after him, Hawkman escapes the building. Then, Gentleman Ghost appears again, saying that the warlock's spell rendered the orb inert years ago, but the Nth Metal broke the spell causing the orb to regain its power. Gentleman Ghost takes the orb, saying that he will use it to transcend death and resurrect himself through the life-force of every man, woman, and child nearby. Then, he disappears and the [[Zombie]]s attacking Hawkman fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Hawkman'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Gentleman Ghost begins fully harnessing the orb’s power, creating a portal from which Julius Gates comes out. Gates (demanding the orb) grabs Craddock, while Hawkman takes the orb from him. The portal vanishes with Craddock and Gates inside causing them both to disappear along with the apparitions and zombies. Hawkman drops the Mortis Orb somewhere in Antarctica to keep it from falling into the wrong hands again.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Hawkman'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Craddock took up residence in a New Hampshire called Duskhaven which he operated out of while he robbed wealthy socialites of Gotham. When the Midnight Shift apprehended him, he revealed his new origins. Some time in the past, Craddock had been a philanderer and drew the ire of a witch, who cursed him, granting his abilities but forcing him to commit criminal acts. He believed the curse would be lifted once the witch died, but it was not, and he found himself to be immortal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gotham By Midnight Annual #1&quot;/&gt;

===DC Rebirth===
In the [[DC Rebirth]] reboot universe, Gentlemen Ghost is first seen sneaking onto the back of a train occupied by Batman, armed with a machine gun.&lt;ref&gt;''All-Star Batman'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he is mentioned by Cheshire and Copperhead as one of the many villains that attempted to kill Batman for Two-Face, but failed. The actual fight between the two is not shown.&lt;ref&gt;''All-Star Batman'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Injustice society.jpg|thumb|150px|Gentleman Ghost in the [[Injustice Society]]. Art by [[Joe Bennett (penciller)|Joe Bennett]].]]
Originally, the Gentleman Ghost seemed to rely on devices to simulate a ghostly existence; the original 1940s stories left the question of his nature open to speculation. Later, however, he is [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned into a true ghost and his abilities altered to follow suit. As a ghost, Craddock has several abilities. He can become intangible and pass effortlessly through solid material. He can become completely invisible. In fact, the appearance of his head as a floating hat and monocle is actually him rendering his decayed face invisible. He has been shown as being able to teleport as short a distance as a few rooms or as far as across states. Gentleman Ghost can also summon spectral weapons including a cane that shoots spectral fire, and flintlock pistols. When passing through Craddock's ghostly form, people will sometimes experience an intense feeling of cold. Since this does not happen every time, it would seem that he can control this effect. Craddock can apparently track psionic energy and travel across dimensions as he did when he followed an astral tether from the Wizard to Johnny Sorrow. On certain occasions most of the manifestations of his abilities like teleportation and phasing are accompanied by a purple glow of spectral energy or transparent mist (possibly courtesy of different pencilers). Around the time of his prophesied return to life, he gains the power to summon and control the spirits of the dead due to his mother's spirit spending centuries recruiting them to help her son. It is unknown if he can still call upon them.

The Gentleman Ghost is apparently unable to touch or be touched by virgins. This is confirmed by his inability to do harm to both [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]] and [[Jakeem Thunder]]. However, he can pick up a real weapon and be able to hurt them, as when he brandished the Cosmic Rod.

As a supernatural being, Gentleman Ghost cannot be killed and is very hard to hurt. However, those with royal blood can physically harm him and, when unaware, energy hitting him causes pain.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Gentleman Ghost appears in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]]. This version is referred to only as 'Gentleman Jim Craddock' instead of 'Gentleman Ghost'. In the episode &quot;Ghost&quot;, a man casts a spell to bring Gentleman Ghost to the living so that he can take revenge on [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] for imprisoning his spirit. He uses his powers to turn U.N. representatives into ghosts and later turns Superman and Wonder Woman into ghosts. The curse is eventually broken, after which the Superfriends used the mystical Rods of [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] to send Gentleman Ghost back to his grave, never to return.
* Gentleman Ghost was briefly considered to be featured in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. The producers wanted to cast legendary British actor [[Patrick Stewart]] for the role.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/unused/batman/gentleman.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gentleman Ghost appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]].

* Gentleman Ghost appears in several episodes of the animated series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold|Batman: The Brave and The Bold]]'', voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]. In this version, &quot;Gentleman&quot; Jim Craddock was an infamous [[highwayman]] in 20th century London who tried to obtain immortality by offering 10 souls to the demon [[Asteroth]] in exchange. However, he was stopped by the combined efforts of [[Sherlock Holmes]], the demon [[Etrigan]] and a time-displaced [[Batman]]. After being hung for his crimes, Craddock rose as Gentleman Ghost, swearing revenge on Batman (the demon stated that only &quot;his soul&quot; would not leave the Earthly plane). Centuries later, he sought revenge by trying to kill Batman in several ways. However, Batman could defend himself with Nth metal.

===Film===
* Gentleman Ghost appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://comicbook.com/dc/2016/12/12/new-lego-batman-movie-tv-spot-features-gentlemen-ghost-calendar-/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
* Gentleman Ghost also appears as a villain in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold – The Videogame]]'' voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]. Gentleman Ghost hires the [[Clock King]] to lure Batman to London, England, and later lures him and Hawkman into the underworld, in order to offer them to Astaroth as a sacrifice in exchange for his life back. When that fails, a vengeful Craddock attempts to bury them under, and later fights them in a graveyard. After being humiliated, Hawkman teaches Batman to have respect even for his enemies, and picks up the villain respectfully to take him to jail.
* Gentleman Ghost also appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Jason Brenizer.

{{nihongo|'''Genzo Kurita'''|栗田 源蔵|''Kurita Genzō''|extra=November 3, 1926 – October 14, 1959}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[serial killer]] who murdered eight people.

== Murders ==
Kurita [[murder]]ed two girlfriends in February 1948. On August 8, 1951, he [[rape]]d and murdered a 24-year-old woman beside her baby. He then had [[Necrophilia|sex with her corpse]].

On October 11, 1951, he raped and murdered a 29-year-old woman. He threw her three children from a [[cliff]] called [[Osen Korogashi]]. One survived.

Kurita killed a 63-year-old woman and her 24-year-old niece on January 13, 1952. Afterward, he had sex with the niece's dead body. At the crime scene, the police found his [[fingerprint]]s.

== Arrest, trial, and execution ==
Kurita was arrested on January 16, 1952.

On August 12, 1952, the district court in Chiba [[death penalty|sentenced him to death]] for the last two murders. The district court in Utsunomiya sentenced him to death for six others on December 21, 1953. He [[appeal]]ed the sentences, but because of mental instability he retracted his appeals on October 21, 1954. He was considered to be [[neurosis|neurotic]] and a danger to himself. He was executed on October 14, 1959.

== Aftermath ==
On May 10, 1956, a pro-[[death penalty]] prosecutor in Supreme Public Prosecutors Office introduced Kurita into a debate about capital punishment in the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | script-title=ja:第024回国会 法務委員会公聴会 第2号 | publisher=[[National Diet Library]] | language=Japanese | url=http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/024/0640/02405100640002c.html | date=1956-05-10 | accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georg Bachmayer''' (August 12, 1913 – May 8, 1945) was an [[SS]]-''[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' (captain) and member of the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' who served as the ''[[Schutzhaftlagerführer]]'', with responsibility for prisoners while they were inside the [[Mauthausen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] concentration camp, he also oversaw granite production in the quarry. In this position he also inspected the satellite camps and supervised the construction of the Ebensee camp. He was considered a brutal sadist:

''&quot;Bachmayer was clearly a sadist. His speciality was to set two mastiff-like bloodhounds (one in 1944 &quot;Lord&quot;) on inmates, which would literally tear them to death. This was known in camp jargon as ‘dying from the dog’s kiss’. The real cause of death from a medical point of view was usually general sepsis, if the inmate didn’t die immediately of heart failure. Of the thousands of inmates that Bachmayer himself killed or tortured, just two cases are mentioned here. One day the evening roll call in block 20 didn’t tally and one inmate was missing. In block 20 the unfortunate victims of Action K were housed under special security measures [...] where they were left to die of hunger. When the missing inmate was noticed, all the other inmates in the entire camp were first required to fall in and remain standing in the roll call area. At the same time a search was initiated and the missing inmate was ultimately found in one of the normal inmate blocks where he had hidden in the hope of avoiding starvation. When Bachmayer received the report that the inmate had been found, he was standing by chance next to the undersigned. He began to tremble with gleeful excitement and said half to himself ‘I’ll batter this one to death myself’, which he then proceeded to do.&quot;''
Gerhard Kanthack, former German government official and political prisoner at Mauthausen (AMM V/3/20)

Several examples of Bachmayer's brutality are described by Vasily Bunelik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bunelik.wix.com/bunelik#!books/cnec|title = mauthausen survivor|date = |accessdate = 1 March 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Thompson|first = Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachmayer committed suicide nearby Prihetsberg (Austria) on May 8, 1945 after shooting his wife and two children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Klee]]: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich - Wer war was vor und nach 1945, Frankfurt am Main, 2.

'''Georg Johannes Rickhey''' (25 August 1898, [[Hildesheim]] &amp;ndash; 1966) was a [[Germany|German]] engineer and the general director of [[Mittelwerk]] GmbH in [[Dora-Mittelbau]].

Rickhey, a doctor of engineering, joined the [[Nazi Party]] in October 1931 as member number 664,050. 
From 1940 he guided Gauamt Technik in Essen and was promoted in 1942 to the leader of NSDAP Gau [[Essen]] and was also at the same time authorized officer in an Essen mining company.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rainer Eisfeld]]: ''Mondsüchtig.

During the [[Second World War]] he held a number of positions with the ''Reichsministerium für Bewaffnung und Munition'' (Reich Ministry for Armament and Munitions) before becoming manager of [[Demag]], a tank production company, in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klee&quot;&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945''., Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

He became head of [[Mittelwerk]] GmbH in [[Dora-Mittelbau]] from April 1944, overseeing production of the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and [[V-2]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;Jens-Christian Wagner: ''Produktion des Todes: Das KZ Mittelbau-Dora'', Göttingen 2001, p. 198f&lt;/ref&gt; His work on these weapons saw him awarded the Knights Cross of the [[War Merit Cross]] along with [[Walter Dornberger]] and [[Wernher von Braun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peenemunde.de/History/jahr1944.html Peenemünde in 1944]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrested in 1945, he was taken by the [[U.S. Army]] to live at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], [[Ohio]] where he worked under the terms of [[Operation Paperclip]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Klee&quot;/&gt; He was subsequently indicted as part of the [[Dachau Trials]] of 1947 under accusations that he had worked closely with the [[SS]] and [[Gestapo]] and witnessed executions. He was acquitted due to a lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Robert Sigel: ''Im Interesse der Gerechtigkeit.

Assigned to assassinate U.S. Vice President [[Andrew Johnson]], he lost his nerve and did not make an attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Hamner, Christopher. &quot;[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24242 Booth's Reason for Assassination] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202112805/http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24242 |date=December 2, 2010 }}.&quot; [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was executed along with three other conspirators by [[hanging]].

==Early life==
Atzerodt was born in Dörna, today part of [[Anrode|Anrode, Germany]]. He immigrated to the United States in 1843 at the age of eight. As an adult, he opened his own carriage repair business in [[Port Tobacco, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://porttobacco.blogspot.com/2010/09/yep-got-it.html|title=Port Tobacco Archaeological Project|author=Jim|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The conspiracy==
In January 1865, some years after opening his failed carriage repair business, Atzerodt was introduced to [[John Wilkes Booth]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] by [[John Surratt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jampoler, Andrew C. A., The Last Lincoln Conspirator: John Surratt's Flight from the Gallows, Naval Institute Press, 2009. p&lt;/ref&gt; Atzerodt was willing to join in Booth's earlier conspiracy to kidnap [[President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], as he later admitted in his trial, which began May 1, 1865.

According to the prosecution, Booth assigned Atzerodt to assassinate [[Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] on April 14, 1865. On that morning, Atzerodt booked room 126 at the [[1111 Pennsylvania Avenue|Kirkwood House]] in Washington, where Johnson was staying. However, he could not muster the courage to kill Johnson so he began drinking at the hotel bar. He presumably got drunk and spent the night walking the streets of Washington.

During his stay at the hotel, Atzerodt had asked the bartender about Johnson's whereabouts. That aroused suspicion the next day after Lincoln was assassinated. An employee of the hotel contacted the police regarding a &quot;suspicious looking man in a gray coat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pitman, Benn ; ''The assassination of President Lincoln and the trial of the conspirators&amp;nbsp;...'' Clark, N.J.: Lawbook Exchange, 2006. ISBN 978-1-58477-600-0 ; p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The military police then conducted a search of Atzerodt's room on April 15 and found that he had not slept in it the night before. Additionally, he had a loaded [[revolver]] concealed under his pillow as well as a concealed [[Bowie knife]]. The police also found a bank book belonging to Booth in the room. Atzerodt was arrested on April 20. He was apprehended at the house of his cousin, Hartman Richter, in [[Germantown, Montgomery County, Maryland|Germantown, Maryland]].

==Trial and execution==
[[File:Lincoln conspirators execution2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Execution of [[Mary Surratt]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]], [[David Herold]] and George Atzerodt on July 7, 1865 in the courtyard of Washington Arsenal (now [[Fort Lesley J. McNair|Fort McNair]]). Digitally restored.]]

Atzerodt's [[Lawyer|attorney]], [[Captain (land)|Captain]] William Doster, stated to the court that he intended &quot;to show that George Atzerodt was a constitutional coward; that if he had been assigned the duty of assassinating the Vice President, he could never have done it; and that, from his known cowardice, Booth probably did not assign to him any such duty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;umkcAtz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/atzerodt.html|title=The Trial of the Lincoln Assassination Conspirators 1865&amp;nbsp;– George Atzerodt|first=Douglas |last=Linder |publisher=Law.umkc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that was to no avail.

After the conviction Atzerodt offered a confession to Reverend Butler, a minister who came to his cell to offer him comfort.  
Butler said that Atzerodt admitted going to the meeting in March to help plan the kidnapping of Lincoln while he attended a play at a hospital.

Atzerodt said he first heard about Booth's plan to assassinate the President just two hours before the shooting. Atzerodt said that Booth really wanted David Herold to assassinate Vice President Johnson because he thought that Herold had &quot;more pluck&quot; than Atzerodt did. Atzerodt said Booth wanted him to &quot;back up&quot; Herold and &quot;give him more courage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;umkcAtz&quot;/&gt;

Atzerodt and three other convicted conspirators ([[Mary Surratt]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]], and [[David Herold]]) were [[hanging|hanged]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], on July 7, 1865.  Atzerodt's [[last words]] were &quot;May we all meet in the other world. God take me now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;umkcAtz&quot;/&gt; He did not die instantly; his neck did not break upon impact, and his body shuddered for several minutes before dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/herald78.html|title=herald415|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atzerodt is interred in Glenwood Cemetery, located at 2219 Lincoln Road NE in Washington, D.C..

[[File:GBPHILLIPS.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Dr George Bagster Phillips in 1888&lt;/center&gt;]]
Dr '''George Bagster Phillips''' [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MBBS]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|MRCS Eng]], [[Midwifery#Midwifery in the United Kingdom|L.M.]], [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|LSA]] (February 1835 in [[Camberwell]], Surrey &amp;ndash; 27 October 1897 in London), was, from 1865, the Police Surgeon for the [[Metropolitan Police|Metropolitan Police's]] 'H' Division, which covered [[London|London's]] [[Whitechapel]] district. He came to prominence during the murders of [[Jack the Ripper]] when he conducted or attended [[Autopsy|autopsies]] on the bodies of four of the victims, namely [[Annie Chapman]], [[Elizabeth Stride]], [[Catharine Eddowes]] and [[Mary Jane Kelly]]. He was called by the police to the murder scenes of three of them: Chapman, Stride and Kelly.

Detective [[Chief Inspector]] [[Walter Dew]], who was a [[constable|detective constable]] in the Whitechapel [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] throughout the Ripper investigation, and who knew Phillips well, remembered him as being in his fifties in 1888. &quot;He was a character,&quot; Dew later wrote, &quot; An elderly man, he was ultra old-fashioned both in his personal appearance and his dress. He used to look for all the world as though he had stepped out of a century-old painting. His manners were charming: he was immensely popular both with the police and the public, and he was highly skilled&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dew, Walter 'I Caught Crippen' Blackie &amp; Son Ltd (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips lived at 2 Spital Square in Whitechapel.

==Early career==
[[File:bagsterphillips3.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Dr George Bagster Phillips&lt;/center&gt;]]
The son of Sarah ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Bagster) and Henry Phillips, George Bagster Phillips was appointed a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. 1888 Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 1888&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips is first mentioned in the [[United Kingdom|British]] national press in [[The Times]] of 24 May 1866, when he attended on James Ashe, who had been cut with a knife and wounded by his brother-in-law, Patrick O'Donnell, a 20-year-old journeyman tailor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 May 1866&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, in 1870, Phillips was called to the [[Stepney]] police station concerning a case of child abuse, when he was asked to examine a 7-year-old girl and the man charged with her sexual assault. He diagnosed both as suffering from [[gonorrhea]] and also found that the young girl had a [[vagina]]l rupture, which Phillips said was an indication of &quot;violence of some kind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Child sexual abuse in Victorian England By Louise Ainsley Jackson Published by Routledge, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Phillips married Eliza Toms (1838-1940) in Kensington in London.

''The Times'' referred to Phillips again on 6 March 1882 when Mary Ann Macarthy, aged 17 and living in a common lodging-house in [[Spitalfields]], was charged on remand with feloniously cutting and wounding Henry Connor, by stabbing him with a knife. Again, Phillips dressed the wounds of the injured party.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 March 1882&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annie Chapman==
[[File:bagsterphillips2.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Phillips examines the body of [[Annie Chapman]] at [[Hanbury Street|29 Hanbury Street]].]]&lt;/center&gt;
Phillips was called by the police to 29 [[Hanbury Street]] at 6.20 a.m. on Saturday 8 September 1888 and arrived there at 6.20. He then immediately examined the body of [[Annie Chapman]] where it lay in the back yard. He stated that &quot;the body was cold, except that there was a certain remaining heat, under the intestines, in the body.&quot; He added that &quot;stiffness of the limbs was not marked, but it was commencing.&quot; At the [[post mortem]], conducted at 2.00 p.m. that afternoon, he also noted that &quot;the stomach contained a little food.&quot; From this information he estimated Chapman's time of death at some time before 4.30 a.m. However, eyewitnesses claimed that the yard was empty at that time, and at the inquest [[Coroner]] [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Wynne Baxter]], who had no medical background, chose the witness testimony over the doctors' opinions and argued that the time of death was 5.30 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/rn-doubt.html [[Casebook: Jack the Ripper]] website]&lt;/ref&gt; After examining Chapman's body he concluded that her reported recent ill health was due to [[tuberculosis]]. Phillips also concluded that she had been sober at the time of death and had not consumed [[alcohol]] for at least some hours before it. ''[[The Lancet]]'' quoted Phillips on the surgical proficiency of Chapman's killer. 'Obviously', Phillips wrote, 'the work was that of an expert- or one, at least, who had such knowledge of anatomical or pathological examinations as to be enabled to secure the pelvic organs with one sweep of the knife'.  His original opinion, given at 6.20 a.m. and backed up by 22 years as a police surgeon, was that Chapman had been dead &quot;for two hours, probably more.&quot;  When a witness said that he had not seen Chapman's body in the yard when he went there at 4.45 - when by Phillips' original estimate she would have been dead for over half an hour - the doctor qualified this by saying that with the coldness of the morning and the amount of blood that she had lost, the victim might have appeared to have been dead for longer than she was.   This gave credence to the dubious evidence of Mrs Elizabeth Long, who claimed to have seen Chapman alive at 5.30.   Chapman was found about 20 minutes after the alleged sighting and Phillips estimated that it would have taken much longer than that to have inflicted all the injuries that he found on her body.&lt;ref&gt;Kendell, Colin 'Jack the Ripper - The Theories and The Facts' Amberley Publishing 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elizabeth Stride==
Phillips was called to Dutfield's Yard in [[Berner Street]] at 1.20 a.m. on Sunday, 30 September 1888, to examine the body of [[Elizabeth Stride]]. At her inquest, held on 3 October 1888, he reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The body was lying on the near side, with the face turned toward the wall, the head up the yard and the feet toward the street. The left arm was extended and there was a packet of cachous in the left hand.

The right arm was over the belly, the back of the hand and wrist had on it clotted blood. The legs were drawn up with the feet close to the wall. The body and face were warm and the hand cold. The legs were quite warm. Deceased had a silk handkerchief round her neck, and it appeared to be slightly torn. I have since ascertained it was cut. This corresponded with the right angle of the jaw. The throat was deeply gashed and there was an abrasion of the skin about one and a half inches in diameter, apparently stained with blood, under her right arm.

At three o'clock p.m. on Monday at St. George's Mortuary, Dr. Blackwell and I made a post mortem examination. Rigor mortis was still thoroughly marked. There was mud on the left side of the face and it was matted in the head. The body was fairly nourished. Over both shoulders, especially the right, and under the collarbone and in front of the chest there was a bluish discoloration, which I have watched and have seen on two occasions since.

There was a clear-cut incision on the neck. It was six inches in length and commenced two and a half inches in a straight line below the angle of the jaw, one half inch in over an undivided muscle, and then becoming deeper, dividing the sheath. The cut was very clean and deviated only a little downwards. The arteries and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through. The cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial, and tailed off to about two inches below the right angle of the jaw. The deep vessels on that side were uninjured. From this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left cartoid artery.

Decomposition had commenced in the skin. Dark brown spots were on the anterior surface of the left chin. There was a deformity in the bones of the right leg, which was not straight, but bowed forwards. There was no recent external injury save to the neck. The body being washed more thoroughly I could see some healing sores. The lobe of the left ear was torn as if from the removal or wearing through of an earring, but it was thoroughly healed. On removing the scalp there was no sign of extravasation of blood.

The heart was small, the left ventricle firmly contracted, and the right slightly so. There was no clot in the pulmonary artery, but the right ventricle was full of dark clot. The left was firmly contracted as to be absolutely empty. The stomach was large and the mucous membrane only congested. It contained partly digested food, apparently consisting of cheese, potato, and farinaceous powder. All the teeth on the lower left jaw were absent.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Catherine Eddowes==
[[Catherine Eddowes]] was killed in the [[City of London]], and so her murder came within the jurisdiction of the [[City of London Police]], who had their own police surgeon, Dr. Frederick Gordon Brown. He was called to the murder scene at [[Mitre Square]]. However, because of his familiarity with the Ripper's previous victims, Phillips was called by the [[Metropolitan Police]] to take part in Eddowes's autopsy.  In his opinion the way in which the incisions were made could only have been the work of someone who had knowledge of anatomical or pathological examinations.

==Mary Jane Kelly==
Together with Dr [[Thomas Bond (British physician)|Thomas Bond]], Phillips examined the remains of [[Mary Jane Kelly]] on 9 November 1888. At the [[inquest]], Phillips reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I was called by the police on Friday morning at eleven o'clock, and on proceeding to Miller's Court, which I entered at 11.15.  I found a room, the door of which led out of the passage at the side of 26, Dorset street, photographs of which I produce. It had two windows in the court. Two panes in the lesser window were broken, and as the door was locked I looked through the lower of the broken panes and satisfied myself that the mutilated corpse lying on the bed was not in need of any immediate attention from me, and I also came to the conclusion that there was nobody else upon the bed, or within view, to whom I could render any professional assistance. Having ascertained that probably it was advisable that no entrance should be made into the room at that time, I remained until about 1.30p.m., when the door was broken open by McCarthy, under the direction of Superintendent Arnold.

On the door being opened it knocked against a table which was close to the left-hand side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition. The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two-thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead, nearest the door. Deceased had only an under-linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination I am sure the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the bedstead which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the bedstead, the saturated condition of the palliasse, pillow, and sheet at the top corner of the bedstead nearest to the partition leads me to the conclusion that the severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead and her head and neck in the top right-hand corner&quot;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was only general evidence.  The coroner, Dr Roderick MacDonald, had told the jury that they would hear Dr Phillips' full post mortem report at &quot;the adjourned inquest&quot; - clearly indicating that there would be a further session, as had happened with the previous victims.   However, after hearing a few more witnesses, he said that he did not know if the jury wished to bring in a verdict - all they had to go was agree on the cause of death, &quot;leaving other matters in the hands of the police&quot; and there was no point in continually going over the same matters.   The jury conferred quickly, then said that they wished to bring in a verdict of &quot;Wilful murder against a person or persons unknown.&quot;  MacDonald then closed the inquest.  Consequently, the coroner had not complied with the legal requisite that the length, breadth and depths of all wounds to the deceased must be recorded and, with conflicting evidence having been given to the inquest, the time of death had not been established.   Phillips had conferred in private with the coroner before the hearing opened, something he had wanted to do at a previous inquest but had been refused.&lt;ref&gt;Kendell, Colin 'Jack the Ripper - The Theories and The Facts' Amberley Publishing 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later cases==
[[File:bagsterphillips1.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Dr George Bagster Phillips&lt;/center&gt;]]
During the later Whitechapel murder investigation, Phillips performed the [[post-mortem]] examination of [[Alice McKenzie]] (nicknamed &quot;Clay Pipe&quot; Alice and who used the alias Alice Bryant), who was killed on 17 July 1889 in Castle Alley in Whitechapel. At the coroner's inquest on 22 July 1889, Phillips stated that the injuries to her throat had been caused by someone who &quot;knew the position of the vessels, at any rate where to cut with reference to causing speedy death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MEPO 3/140, ff. 263-71 22 July 1889&lt;/ref&gt; She had two jagged wounds in the left side of her neck. Phillips also found five superficial marks on the left side of McKenzie's abdomen, which had been made, he thought, by the pressure of a right thumb and fingers prior to mutilating her body with a knife that was held in the murderer's left hand.

Phillips was involved in investigating &quot;The Pinchin Street Murder,&quot; a term coined after the headless and legless torso of a woman was found under a railway arch in Pinchin Street in Whitechapel on 10 September 1889. After examining the medical evidence Phillips, Commissioner [[James Monro]] and Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] concluded that the murder was not committed by Jack the Ripper &lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Sugden (historian)|Sugden, Philip]] 'The Complete History of Jack the Ripper' Robinson, London (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also performed the autopsy on [[Frances Coles]] (also known as Frances Coleman, Frances Hawkins and nicknamed &quot;Carrotty Nell&quot;), born in 1865 and killed on 13 February 1891. He believed that the minor wounds on the back of her head suggested that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut three times. Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body. Phillips did not believe that her murderer displayed any medical knowledge. Cole's body was found under a railway arch in Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel.

His [[obituary]] in ''[[The Lancet]]'' on 13 November 1897 described Phillips as &quot;a leading [[Forensic pathology|police surgeon]] in London&quot;. In it he was described by his assistant, Dr. Percy John Clark, as &quot;a modest man who found self-advertising abhorrent... under a brusque, quick manner engendered by his busy life, there was a warm, kind heart, and a large number of men and women of all classes are feeling that by his death they have lost a very real friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lancet'', 13 November 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips died from [[apoplexy]] on 27 October 1897.

==Portrayal in film==
In the 1988 made-for-television film ''Jack the Ripper'' starring [[Michael Caine]], Phillips was played by actor [[Gerald Sim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095388/fullcredits#cast ''Jack the Ripper'' (1988) on the [[Internet Movie Database]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Emil Banks''' (born June 22, 1942)  is an [[United States|American]] [[spree killer]].  A former Camp Hill [[Prison officer|prison guard]], he shot 13 people to death on September 25, 1982 in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] and [[Jenkins Township, Pennsylvania|Jenkins Township]], including seven children - five being his own - their mothers, some of their relatives, and one bystander. His attorneys argued for the insanity defense, but Banks was convicted of charges including 12 counts of first-degree murder and [[sentenced to death]]. He killed more people in Pennsylvania than any other single mass murderer.

On November 29, 1990, the [[Pennsylvania State Legislature]] barred further use of the electric chair amid debate that electrocution was [[cruel and unusual punishment]]; it approved execution by [[lethal injection]]. Banks' case was appealed and, on December 2, 2004, he received a stay of execution following a determination that he was incompetent for execution. On May 12, 2010, Banks was again declared incompetent to be executed, following a competency hearing held the previous month.&lt;ref name=&quot;incompetent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael R. Sisak (Staff Writer) |url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/judge-banks-incompetent-can-t-be-executed-1.784178 |title=Judge: Banks incompetent, can't be executed |publisher=The Times-Tribune |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
George Emil Banks was born in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] to John Mack, who was African American, and Mary Yelland, who is white. His parents were not married. According to his attorneys at his later trial, he suffered severely from racism while he was growing up because of being [[mixed race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Various|title=Various Articles from 1982 and 1983|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=George+Banks+murders&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=G&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;tbs=nws:1,ar:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=JzeOTeviGJGatwe7z7i9DQ&amp;ved=0CHcQggE|work=Various Articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP12&gt;[Associated Press, &quot;Decades on death row: Now delusional, George Banks killed 13 people, including 5 of his children in 1982&quot;], PennLive, 29 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult life==
In 1961 at the age of 19, Banks and some accomplices robbed a tavern, shooting and injuring the unarmed owner. He served eight years in prison for these offenses.&lt;ref name=AP12/&gt;

After getting out, he married Doris M. Banks, who is black, on August 23, 1969. They had two daughters together. The couple divorced in 1976. 

As noted by his attorney during his trial, Banks seemed to have been deeply affected by racial issues. After his divorce, he dated white women. By September 1982 he had broken up with girlfriend Sharon Mazillo, who had lived with him at one time, and they were disputing custody of their young son. He was living with three women in his house; they were mothers of four of his children, and one had another daughter living with her.&lt;ref name=AP12/&gt;

Despite his criminal record for an armed offense, Banks had started working as a prison guard at [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania]] in 1980. In 1982 Banks had told coworkers at the prison that &quot;the world would soon be consumed by a race war and said he wanted to prevent the five children he fathered with the four white girlfriends from the torment and agony of racism.&quot;&lt;ref name=AP12/&gt; He was put on &quot;an extended leave of absence&quot; the first week in September 1982 after a conflict with a supervisor and threatening [[suicide]]. The prison ordered Banks to be examined for mental health issues at a Harrisburg-area hospital.&lt;ref name=AP12/&gt;

==Shootings==
On the night of September 24, 1982, Banks drank quantities of straight gin and took prescription drugs at his home on Schoolhouse Lane in [[Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania]].  The next morning on September 25, 1982, he used an [[AR-15]] [[semi-automatic rifle]] to kill eight people in his house, including three women in their 20s (all girlfriends and mothers of his children) and five children, four of them his. Two of the women were sisters.&lt;ref name=AP12/&gt; Banks dressed in military fatigues and went outside, where he saw 22-year-old Jimmy Olsen and 24-year-old Ray Hall, Jr, who were leaving a house across the street. He shot at them both, reportedly yelling that they &quot;would not tell anyone about this,&quot; before he fired. He hit both men, fatally wounding Hall; Olsen survived. Banks drove away.   

He went to Heather Highlands mobile home park, where his former girlfriend Sharon Mazzillo and their son Kissamayu lived. He had been trying to get custody of their son. Banks forced his way in and shot Mazzillo. He next shot and killed his sleeping son. Banks killed Sharon’s mother, who was trying to call police, and Sharon's 7-year-old nephew, who were also in the home. Hiding in the closet was Sharon’s brother, whom Banks did not see. He was the only survivor and called police, identifying Banks as the shooter.

When police examined the victims at the mobile home park, they made the connection to the shooting of Olsen and Hall, who had been discovered at Schoolhouse Lane. They next found Banks' victims in his house. Police began to search for Banks, who abandoned his car and carjacked another vehicle. He abandoned that vehicle and drove around, stopping in an isolated area. He lay down in a grassy area and fell asleep.   

After Banks awoke, he went to his mother’s house, also in Wilkes Barre. He was said to confess to her. She called his home to check on his children and reached police there, who tried to keep Banks on the phone. He hung up, got more ammunition and went to a vacated rental house.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

A standoff between Banks and police began. The police brought his mother to their base to talk with him. They tried various tactics to get Banks to surrender, including having a false news report played over WILK radio saying that the children were alive and needed blood to survive.  The police tried to draw Banks out of the house. Finally, Robert Brunson, a former co-worker of Banks, was able to talk him out. It took 4 hours for the standoff to end. As of September 30, 1982, Banks was charged with 8 counts of murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person, stealing a car, robbery and theft. He was held without bail.&lt;ref name=AP82&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=Associated Press|title=Banks named in 8 more murder indictments|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MfwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=feQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5013,6481003&amp;dq=george+banks+murders&amp;hl=en|work=The Reading Eagle|date= 30 September 1982 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On June 6, 1983 the trial for Banks began at the Luzerne County Courthouse in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.  Banks insisted on testifying. He said that he had only wounded some of the victims and police had killed them. Several scene witnesses, Banks family members, and Olsen testified. Olsen identified Banks as the person who shot him and left him for dead. Closing arguments took place on June 21, 1983. Banks' attorney argued that he was insane, but the jury found Banks guilty of 12 counts of first-degree murder, one count of third-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, and one count each of robbery, theft, and endangering the life of another person. On June 22, 1983, the jury recommended the death penalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap12&quot;/&gt;

Banks was incarcerated in the maximum-security unit at Huntingdon until November 1985. His appeals reached the US Supreme Court but it refused to overturn his verdict. He was then sent to the Correctional Institute at Graterford, where he was housed in a contained housing unit.  

From 1987 to 2000 Banks' attorneys continued to appeal his case. The US Supreme Court refused to hear his attorneys' argument that he lacked the mental competency to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press|first=Associated|title=Pennsylvania man who killed his family is ruled incompetent for execution|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/05/pennsylvania_man_who_killed_hi.html|work=PennLive.com|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania Governor [[Tom Ridge]] twice signed a death warrant for Banks; however, both times federal appellate courts have stayed his execution.

In 2001, 2006 and 2008 the court held hearings about the mental state of Banks in order to determine if he could be executed. He exhibited delusional behavior that caused the court to rule him incompetent for execution. During this period, various appeals were being heard by state and federal courts.

'''George Bennett''' (died 23 July 1880) was charged with the murder of [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], one of the [[Fathers of Confederation]]. He was convicted of this crime and hanged in Toronto, Ontario. 

==Background to armed confrontation with George Brown==

Bennett had been an employee of the ''[[Toronto Globe]]'' where George Brown was founder and editor. He had been dismissed after repeated problems with drinking and general work habits. 

An armed confrontation with the editor ensued on 24 March 1880. This resulted in a bullet wound which became infected and led to Brown's death.

===Execution of Bennett===

After Brown had succumbed to his injuries seven weeks subsequent to Bennett's armed attack, Bennett was tried and hanged on conviction, a few weeks later.

'''George Chapman''' (14 December 1865 &amp;ndash; 7 April 1903) was a Polish [[serial killer]] known as the Borough Poisoner. Born '''Seweryn Antonowicz Kłosowski''' in [[Congress Poland]], he moved as an adult to [[England]], where he committed his crimes. He was convicted and executed after poisoning three women, but is remembered today mostly because some police officers suspected him of being the notorious serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]].

== Early life ==
Chapman was born in the village of Nagórna, (now part of [[Koło]]), in the [[Warsaw Governorate]] of [[Congress Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.441&quot;&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, p.441&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a certificate found in his personal effects after his arrest, he was apprenticed at age 14 to a senior surgeon, Moshko (Mosze) Rappaport, in [[Zwoleń]], whom he assisted in procedures such as the application of [[leech]]es for blood-letting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.441&quot;/&gt;  He then enrolled on a course in practical surgery at the [[Warsaw]] Praga Hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.441&quot;/&gt;  This course was very brief, lasting from October 1885 to January 1886 (attested to by another certificate in his possession) but he continued to serve as a nurse, or doctor's assistant in Warsaw until December 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.441&quot;/&gt;  He later left Poland for London, though the time he arrived at London has never been reliably ascertained. Witness testimony at his trial seems to indicate that he emigrated to London in 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loriol2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author= Peter De Loriol|title= Murder and Crime in London|year= 2010|publisher= History Press Limited|ISBN= 978-0-7524-5657-7|p= 61, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in the [[East End of London|East End]] he had married a young Polish girl, Lucie Badewski in 1889 and had two children with her&lt;ref&gt;[http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/5889905/person/-1378624179 Severin Antoniovich Klosowski on [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt; and soon afterwards was confronted because of this by his original Polish wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loriol2010&quot; /&gt;

== Crimes and execution ==

Chapman took at least four mistresses, who posed as his wife. Three were poisoned to death by him.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot; p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; They were Mary Isabella Spink (1858 - 25 December 1897),&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.445&quot;&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, p.445&lt;/ref&gt; Bessie Taylor (died 14 February 1901)&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.445&quot;/&gt; and Maud Marsh (died 22 October 1902).&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.447&quot;&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, p.447&lt;/ref&gt; He administered the compound [[Tartar emetic#Derivatives|tartar-emetic]] to each of them, having purchased it from a chemist in [[Hastings]], [[Sussex]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Philip Sugden p.444&quot;&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper, p.444&lt;/ref&gt; Rich in the metallic element [[antimony]], improper usage of tartar-emetic causes a painful death with symptoms similar to [[arsenic poisoning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.444&quot;/&gt;

His motives for these murders are unclear. In one case, his victim left him a legacy of [[£]]500, but he gained nothing from the other two victims.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, p.462&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspicions surrounding Marsh's death led to a police investigation. It was found that she had been poisoned, as had the other two women, whose bodies were [[exhumation|exhumed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.447&quot;/&gt;

An indictment for murder could contain only one count and Chapman was therefore charged only with the murder of Maud Marsh. He was prosecuted by Sir [[Archibald Bodkin]] and the solicitor-general, Sir [[Edward Carson]], convicted on 19 March 1903 and [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth Prison]] on 7 April 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.447&quot;/&gt; Immediately following his death his widow Lucie Kłosowski married Frank Szymanski in April 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=FreeBMDMarriage&amp;h=28043345&amp;ti=5538&amp;indiv=try&amp;gss=pt&amp;ssrc=pt_t5889905_p6131993647_kpidz0q3d6131993647z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid  Marriage of Frank Szymanski and Lucie Kłosowski in the England &amp; Wales, Free BMD Marriage Index, 1837-1915 [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jack the Ripper suspect ==
[[File:Klosowski.jpg|left|100px|George Champman]]
One of the detectives at [[Scotland Yard]], [[Frederick Abberline]], is reported to have told [[George Godley]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casebook.org/police_officials/po-god.html&lt;/ref&gt; the policeman who arrested Kłosowski: &quot;You've got Jack the Ripper at last!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; In two 1903 interviews with the ''Pall Mall Gazette'', Abberline spelled out his suspicions, referring to Kłosowski by name.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete history of Jack the Ripper&quot;, pp.440—441.&lt;/ref&gt; Abberline thought Chapman was Jack the Ripper because during the &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; frenzy he had closely interviewed his first &quot;wife&quot; since arriving in England, Lucie Badewski, and she had told him that her husband often used to go out during the night for hours on end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loriol2010&quot; /&gt;

Speculation in contemporary newspaper accounts and books has led to Chapman, like fellow serial killer [[Thomas Neill Cream]], becoming one of many [[List of proposed Jack the Ripper suspects|suspects]] in the infamous Jack the Ripper murders of 1888. As far as is known, Chapman was not a suspect at the time of the murders. Chapman was a later surname borrowed in 1895 from one of his [[common-law marriage|common-law wives]] whom he did not poison — (Sarah) Annie Chapman (not to be confused with the [[Annie Chapman|Jack the Ripper victim of the same name]]).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper, p.443&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Recent writers are divided about whether Chapman should be regarded as a serious Ripper suspect. [[Philip Sugden (historian)|Philip Sugden]] considered that Chapman ''is'' the most likely candidate among known Ripper suspects, but that the case against him is far from proven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.465&quot;&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, p.465&lt;/ref&gt;  However John Eddleston rated Chapman at only 2 (&quot;a remote possibility&quot;) on his 0 to 5 rating of Ripper suspects.&lt;ref name=Eddleston&gt;Eddleston, John J ''Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Begg only dealt with Chapman briefly, and evidently did not regard him as a serious suspect.&lt;ref name=Begg&gt;Begg, Paul ''Jack the Ripper: The Facts''&lt;/ref&gt;

The case against Chapman rests mainly on the point that he undoubtedly was a violent man with a [[misogynist]]ic streak. He was known to beat his common-law-wives and was prone to other violent behaviour. While living in the US, Chapman allegedly forced his wife, Lucy Klosowska, down on their bed and began to strangle her, only stopping to attend to a customer who walked into the shop which adjoined their room. When he left, she was said to have found a knife under the pillow. He reportedly later told her that he had planned to behead her, even pointing out the spot where he would have buried her and reciting what he would have said to their neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, pp. 449-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman had arrived at [[Whitechapel]] roughly around the time the first murder took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loriol2010&quot; /&gt; His description matched the man seen with [[Mary Jane Kelly]] (the fifth victim of the &quot;canonical five&quot;) and the murders stopped when he left for the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loriol2010&quot; /&gt;  It has even been suggested that he carried out a Ripper-style killing in [[New York City]], the murder of [[Carrie Brown (murder victim)|Carrie Brown]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.465&quot; /&gt; but recent research suggests he did not reach the US until after this murder.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderlinden, Wolf, &quot;The New York Affair - Part 3&quot; ''Ripper Notes'' #19 (July 2004) ISBN 0-9759129-0-9&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is a lack of any hard evidence that would link Chapman to the Ripper murders. The main argument against treating him as a serious Ripper suspect is that it would be unusual for a serial killer to change his method of killing, from mutilation to poisoning,&lt;ref name=Begg/&gt; although some authorities have cast doubt on whether this is as unusual as is supposed.&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas, &quot;American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology&quot;, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also some doubt about whether he could speak English at the time, as the Ripper would have had to, and whether as a recent immigrant he would have had the intimate knowledge of the Whitechapel district that the Ripper seems to have had.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loriol2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eddleston/&gt;  The Ripper appears to have selected victims who were previously unknown to him, while Chapman killed acquaintances, and although Chapman did live in Whitechapel it was not particularly near the scene of the murders.&lt;ref name=Eddleston/&gt;

Chapman's story was dramatised twice by [[Harry Alan Towers|Towers of London]]. Firstly in 1949 in ''Secrets of Scotland Yard'' as ''George Chapman... Poisoner, Publican and Lady Killer'' and then again in a 1951 episode of ''[[The Black Museum]]'' entitled &quot;The Straight Razor&quot;. Both conclude with a brief argument for Chapman's identity as Jack the Ripper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1501">'''George Dale''' (1895 – April 20, 1934) was the lover and criminal partner of [[Eleanor Jarman]], dubbed by the press &quot;The Blonde Tigress&quot;, and was [[capital punishment|executed]] by the state of [[Illinois]] for the murder of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] [[Tailor|clothier]] Gustav Hoeh.

Dale was the triggerman in the robbery of Hoeh's store, and was the only one of the gang (the other member was Leo Minnici) to get the death penalty. Both Minnici and Jarman were sentenced to 199 years for the August 1933 murder. Minnici was paroled in 1954. Jarman escaped from prison in 1940 and was never caught.

One of Dale's last acts before his electrocution was to write a love letter to Jarman.

'''George David Silva''' (1884 &amp;ndash; 1912) was an [[Australian]] [[mass murderer]]. Silva, who was of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] descent, worked as a farmhand on a property owned by Charles Ching at Alligator Creek, about 20 miles from [[Mackay, Queensland]].

On 16 November 1911, Charles Ching told Silva he was traveling to town for supplies and money for Silva's wages. While he was away Silva murdered the six Chings after the eldest daughter Maud had rejected his advances. The bodies of Agnes, Maud, Hugh and Winnie were found in the house. Mother and eldest daughter had been shot by a [[revolver]] and a [[muzzle-loading rifle]], while the boy and baby had their skulls smashed in. The bodies of Teddy and Dolly Ching were found a mile and a half away; both had been shot and their skulls smashed in.

Police and aboriginal trackers inspected the crime scene, and after the trackers stated that there was no trail to follow the police homed in on Silva. Silva, fearing a lynch mob from Mackay, eventually confessed to police.

Tried only for the murder of Maud Ching, Silva was hanged at [[Boggo Road Gaol]] in [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] on 10 June 1912 and buried in [[South Brisbane Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=123920 Silva George David] &amp;mdash; Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Engel''' (April 15, 1836{{spaced ndash}}November 11, 1887) was an [[anarchist]] and [[labor union]] activist executed after the [[Haymarket Riot|Haymarket riot]], along with [[Albert Parsons]], [[August Spies]], and [[Adolph Fischer]].

==Early life==
George Engel was born to an impoverished family with three other children.  His father, Konrad, a mason and bricklayer, died when he was less than two years old. His mother died when he was 12, leaving him an [[orphan]].  He lived for a short time with a [[foster care|foster family]], but at the age of 14 was forced to look for work.  He was apprenticed to a shoemaker, but was unable to afford the dues.

He travelled to [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]] and finally found work as a painter's apprentice.  He travelled around [[Germany]] working, and in 1868 opened a business of his own.  He married the same year, but found that the economic conditions in Germany made survival difficult, and so decided to follow his boyhood dream of emigrating to the [[United States]]. He left Germany in 1872, arriving first in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in January 1873, where he worked in a sugar refinery. In 1874, he left Philadelphia and moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he later, in 1876, was to open his own toyshop.

==Activism==

Working at a factory, Engel first became acquainted with [[socialism]] when one of his coworkers took him to a meeting of the [[International Workingmen's Association]]. He soon joined. In 1878, a crackdown on socialist organizations led to the dissolution of the IWA, but Engel was instrumental in forming another organization, the Socialistic Labor Party of North America, and finally, in 1882 he joined the new International Working People's Association.

==Haymarket Square==
On May 3, 1886, after hearing about the massacre at the McCormick Plant earlier that day, he attended a meeting at Grief's Hall. This meeting, later dubbed by prosecutors the &quot;Monday Night Conspiracy&quot;, was used to prove that there was a conspiracy in the bombing at the Haymarket. A witness claimed that Engel had arranged a plan to storm and/or [[dynamite]] police stations and shoot policeman should trouble occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagohs.org/hadc/tranSCRIPT/volumei/051-100/I053-075.htm HADC - Testimony of Godfried Waller (first appearance), 1886 July 16&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Engel claims it was a meeting only &quot;in which it was proposed to give aid to any strikers if the police or the Pinkertons should attack said strikers.&quot;

The following night, May 4, as the bombing took place, Engel was not in Haymarket Square, but was at home playing cards. Nevertheless, he was arrested the next day and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] in the bombings. At 50, he was the oldest of the defendants to stand trial. He was convicted and was sentenced to be [[hanging|hanged]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/haymarket/haymarketdefendants.html Meet the Haymarket Defendants&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing in 1887 that several letters had been written from [[Samuel Fielden]] and [[Michael Schwab]] to [[Illinois Governor]] [[Richard James Oglesby]], Engel wrote his own letter asking the governor not to consider any [[clemency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagohs.org/hadc/manuscripts/m04/M04.htm HADC - George Engel letter to Governor Richard Oglesby, 1887 Nov. 9&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Engel was hanged with three others of the condemned on November 11, 1887. His last words were reportedly &quot;Hurrah for anarchy! This is the happiest moment of my life&quot;, screamed from the gallows in his native [[German language|German]].

Engel was buried, in a plot marked since 1893 by the Haymarket Martyrs Monument, in the [[German Waldheim Cemetery|Waldheim Cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=10545593|title=Haymarket Martyrs Monument|accessdate=2008-05-05 |format= |work=Findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now Forest Home Cemetery) in [[Forest Park, Illinois|Forest Park]], [[Illinois]].

'''George Fleetwood''' (1623–1672) was an English major-general and one of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides of King Charles I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;David Plant,[http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/fleetwood-george.htm George Fleetwood, Regicide, bap.1623], the British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleetwood was one of the commissioners for the [[trial of Charles I]], 1648–9; member of last Commonwealth [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]] and M.P. for Buckinghamshire, 1653; for Buckingham, 1654; member of [[Cromwell's Upper House]], 1657; joined General [[George Monck]], 1660, and though condemned to death at the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], was never executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Lee|Lee, Sidney]] (1903), [[Dictionary of National Biography]] [https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft Index and Epitome]  [https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft#page/444/mode/1up p. 444].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
George Fleetwood was the grandson of Sir George Fleetwood (died December 1620), and the son of Charles Fleetwood (died 1628) and inherited the family estate of [[the Vache]] on the death of his father.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Christopher Durston, &quot;Fleetwood, George, appointed Lord Fleetwood under the protectorate (bap. 1623, d. in or after 1664)&quot;, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9685, accessed 16 November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some older sources such as [[Dictionary of National Biography]] (1889) &quot;Fleetwood, George, Volume xix&quot; [https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofnati19stepuoft#page/265/mode/1up pp. 265,266] state that George Fleetwood was the son of Sir Georg Fleetwood, knt., of [[the Vache]], near Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire, and Catherine, daughter of Henry Benny of Waltham, Essex; and that in the will of Sir George Fleetwood, who died December 1620, George Fleetwood is described as his third son, but Edward and Charles, his elder brothers, appear to have died without issue. While [[Bernard Burke|John Bernard Burke]] publishing in the 1830s lists George Fleetwood (regicide) as a brother of [[Charles Fleetwood]] (parliamentary general), and [[George Fleetwood (Swedish general)]] as their uncle, brother of Sir William who is listed as their father (John Burke, ''A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland Enjoying Territorial Possessions Or High Official Rank: But Uninvested with Heritable Honours'', Volume 4, Colburn, 1838. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DchsAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA522&amp;lpg=PA522&amp;dq=EDMUND+FLEETWOOD+of+Rossall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pvu--ADzXV&amp;sig=uFR5J-o6-o_-BUl_yx8mLZPe5E4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j0CmSoqOAoG5jAe6jcSfDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=EDMUND%20FLEETWOOD%20of%20Rossall&amp;f=false p. 522])&amp;mdash;This is unlikely as Burk's family tree does not explain how George the regicide came to inherit (and lose) the Vache when there were others closer in line to inherit the estate, but several other old sources also include this relationship, for example [[Mark Noble (biographer)|Mark Noble]] (1798) in ''The lives of the English regicides: and other commissioners of the pretended High court of justice, appointed to sit in judgement upon their sovereign, King Charles the First'', Volume I, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v_1HAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Fleetwood+regicide+brother+of+charles#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 243].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mercunrius Aulicua,'' 7 December 1643, it is stated that &quot;Young Fleetwood of The Vache&quot; had raised a troop of dragoons for the parliament, to defend the Chiltern parts of Buckinghamshire; and in an ordinance of 27 June 1644 the name of Fleetwood appears in the list of the Buckinghamshire committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=265}}. Cites: Husband, ''Ordinance'', 1646, p.&amp;nbsp;54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleetwood entered the [[Long Parliament]] in July 1647 as member for Buckinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}. Cites: ''Names of Members returned to serve in Parliament'', i 485.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1648 he was appointed one of the commissioners for the trial of the king, attended two sittings of the court, and was present also when sentence was pronounced, and signed the death-warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}: Nalson, ''Trial of Charles I''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1649 and 1650 Fleetwood was colonel of the Buckinghamshire militia, and was chosen a member of the eighth and last [[Council of State (England)|council of state]] of the Commonwealth from 1 November to l0 December 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}. Cites: ''Cal State Papers'', Dom. 1653-4, p. xxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; He represented the county of Buckingham in the [[Barebones Parliament|assembly of 1653]], and the town in the [[First Protectorate Parliament|parliament of 1654]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}. Cites: ''Old Parliamentary History'', xx. 176, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell knighted him in the autumn of 1656, and summoned him to [[Cromwell's Upper House]] in December 1657.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}. Cites: ''Perfect Politician'', ed. 1680, p.&amp;nbsp;293 ; ''Old Parliamentary History'' , xxi. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of Sir [[George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer|George Booth]]'s rising parliament authorised Fleetwood to raise a &quot;troop of well-affected volunteers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}. Cites: ''Cal. State Papers'', Dom. 1669–60, pp.&amp;nbsp;125, 606.&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to assist [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] against [[George Monck]], opposed the oath of abjuration in parliament, was entrusted with the command of a regiment by Monck in the spring of 1660, and proclaimed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] at York on 11 May 1660.&lt;ref name=&quot;Firth - HMC 159&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}. Cites: ''Hist. MSS. Comm.'' 7th Rep. p.&amp;nbsp;159.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[regicides]] were summoned to surrender he gave himself up on 16 June 1660, but was excepted from the [[Act of Indemnity of 1660|Act of Indemnity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}. Cites: Kennett, ''Register'', pp.&amp;nbsp;181, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; At his trial (October 1660) Fleetwood pleaded guilty, was sentenced to death, and said, weeping, that he had confessed the fact, and wished he could express his sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1889|p=266}}. Cites: ''Trial of the regicides'', pp.&amp;nbsp;28, 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

A saving clause in the Act of Indemnity suspended the execution of those who claimed the benefit of the king's proclamation, unless their conviction was followed by a special act of parliament for their execution. Fleetwood accordingly petitioned parliament, stating that his name was inserted in the list of commissioners without his knowledge and against his will, and that his signature to the warrant was extorted by Cromwell, &quot;whose power, commands, and threats (he being then young) frighted him into court&quot;.

'''George Forster''' (or '''Foster''') was found guilty of murdering his wife and child by drowning them in [[Paddington Canal]], [[London]]. He was [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Newgate]] on 18 January 1803, shortly after which his body was taken to a nearby house where it was used in an experiment by [[Italy|Italian]] scientist [[Giovanni Aldini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The Newgate Calendar]] |url=http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng464.htm |title=George Foster Executed at Newgate, 18th of January, 1803, for the Murder of his Wife and Child, by drowning them in the Paddington Canal; with a Curious Account of Galvanic Experiments on his Body |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his trial the events were reconstructed. Forster's mother in law recounted that her daughter and grandchild had left her house to see Forster at 4 p.m. on Saturday 4 December 1802. Joseph Bradfield, in whose house Forster lodged, reported that they had stayed together that night and gone out at 10 a.m. on the Sunday morning. He also stated that Forster and his wife had not been on good terms because she wished to live with him. Various witnesses saw Forster with his wife and child in public houses near Paddington Canal during the day on the Sunday. The body of his child was found on the Monday morning and, after the canal was dragged for three days, his wife's body was also found.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

Forster claimed that upon leaving The Mitre he set out alone for [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]] in order to see his other two children who were in the [[workhouse]] there, though he was forced to turn back at [[Whetstone, London|Whetstone]] due to the failing light. This was contradicted by a waiter at the Mitre who said the three left the inn together. Scepticism was also expressed that he could have walked to Whetstone in the time he claimed. The jury found him guilty. He was sentenced to death and also to be dissected thereafter. This sentence was designed not only to provide medicine with corpses on which to experiment, but also to ensure that the condemned could not rise on [[Judgement Day]], their bodies having been cut into pieces and selectively discarded. Forster was hanged on 18 January, shortly before which he made a full confession. He said he had come to hate his wife and had twice before taken his wife to the canal but his nerve had both times failed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

A recent ''[[BBC Knowledge]]'' documentary (''Real Horror: Frankenstein'') questions the fairness of the trial. It notes that friends of George Forster's wife later claimed that she was extremely suicidal and had often talked about killing herself and her daughter. According to this documentary, Forster attempted suicide by stabbing himself with a crudely fashioned knife. This was to avoid awakening during the dissection of his body, should he not have died when hanged. This was a real possibility owing to the crude methods of execution at the time. The same reference suggests that his 'confession' was obtained under duress. In fact, it alleges that Pass, a [[Beadle]] on Aldini's payroll, fast-tracked the whole trial and legal procedure in order to obtain the freshest corpse possible for his benefactor.

[[File:A Galvanised Corpse.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of a galvanised corpse]]After the execution Forster's body was given to [[Giovanni Aldini]] for experimentation. Aldini was the nephew of fellow scientist [[Luigi Galvani]] and an enthusiastic proponent of his uncle's method of stimulating muscles with electric current, known as [[Galvanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/History/early-nineteen.htm |title=Early Nineteenth century electrochemistry |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment he performed on Forster's body was a demonstration of this technique. ''[[The Newgate Calendar]]'' (a record of executions at Newgate) reports that, &quot;On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened. In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

Several of those present believed that Forster was being brought back to life (''The Newgate Calendar'' reports that even if this had been so, he would have been re-executed since his sentence was to &quot;hang until he be dead&quot;) and one man, Mr Pass, the beadle of the Surgeons' Company, was so shocked that he died shortly after leaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt; The hanged man was certainly dead, since his blood had been drained and his [[spinal cord]] severed after the execution.

*The [[Galvanism]] experiment performed on George Forster was explored in the [[Science Channel]]'s ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]''.
*George Forster was noted on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] show called, ''Zombies: A Living History''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3719">'''George William Gee''' (c. 1881 - 22 July 1904) was the first person to be hanged in the town of [[Woodstock, New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]. He was tried for the murder of Miss Millie Gee, his cousin and ex-lover. The trial took place in the [[Old Carleton County Court House]], and he was hanged in the [[Woodstock Gaol]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GEORGE GEE SENTENCED TO DEATH|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nbcarlet/geetrial.htm|accessdate=26 November 2011|newspaper=Carleton Sentinel|date=April 29, 1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The murder ==
George and Millie had been seeing each other for three or four years, when Millie lost interest and asked him not to see her anymore. Shortly thereafter, she was hired to look after the house and children of Bennie Gee because his wife had left him. She stayed in the house next door with Bennie's sister Catherine and her husband Daniel Crane.

On Saturday, 12 March 1904, George arrived at Bennie's residence with a [[Lee–Enfield|Lee–Enfield Rifle]] that he had borrowed from a Lt. Weldon W. Melville. He had been drinking steadily for most of the afternoon, but was friendly enough when he arrived, and left the rifle at the door. He stayed late, playing cards with Bennie and continuing to drink until three in the morning, when George announced that he should leave and was helped to the door by Millie.

As he was going out he uttered his later famous words, ''I suppose you don't know that this is the night you're going to die.'' He then turned around, picked up the rifle and fired. The bullet ricocheted off the frame of the door and entered Millie's chest, knocking her to the floor.

Hearing the shot, Bennie ran to the door. George fired twice in his direction but missed. He then fled. After a time he walked the long distance to a phone and called Dep. Sheriff Foster to turn himself in.

Three doctors were called to attend Millie, but they could not save her life. She died the following Wednesday a short time after giving her deposition to Dep. Sheriff Foster.

== The trial ==
After a preliminary hearing, the trial was set for 26 April 1904 with Judge Tucker presiding. Attorney General Pugsley was for the Crown. J. Chipman Hartley and T C L Ketchum were for the defense.

Gee pleaded not guilty and the calling of witnesses began. In all, 23 were called, most of them close friends and relatives. In his closing arguments Ketchum pleaded with the jury that Gee was insane, drunk, and too poor to mount a proper defense. He claimed a charge of [[manslaughter]] would be more appropriate. His full argument lasted a full hour and left Gee in tears.

The crown argued that the crime was premeditated and that Gee couldn't have been insane, as he had obviously realized his crime when he turned himself in.

The jury deliberated for only 45 minutes before they returned a verdict of guilty. Judge Tucker sentenced Gee to hang on the grounds of the (then) new jail.

== The execution ==
The hanging went forward as planned, although there was a delay for the rope to be shipped in from out of town, since no one from the town would sell it. The executioner, Radcliffe, was swift in the hanging, and the rope snapped Gee's neck. He was pronounced dead 13 minutes afterwards.

[[File:Godloy.jpg|thumb|right|George Godley]]
'''George Albert Godley''' (31 October 1857 &amp;ndash; 20 July 1941) was a police officer of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] who was involved in the hunt for [[Jack the Ripper]] in 1888.&lt;ref name=begg&gt;Begg, Fido, and Skinner ''The Jack the Ripper A-Z''&lt;/ref&gt;

Born at [[East Grinstead]] in [[Sussex]] in 1857, the third eldest of 11 children born to George Godley (1829-1900), a sawyer, and Elizabeth (née Howard, born 1830),&lt;ref name=Tree&gt;[http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/15141325/person/218930587 The Godley Family Tree on [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt; like his father, George Albert Godley initially worked as a [[wikt:sawyer|sawyer]]. He then joined the Metropolitan Police on 26 February 1877, and was assigned warrant number 61230.&lt;ref name=Met /&gt; At the time of the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders in 1888 Godley was a [[Police Sergeant#Police 6|Sergeant]] in London's J Division ([[Bethnal Green]]). He transferred to H Division ([[Whitechapel]]) where he assisted [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]] [[Frederick Abberline]] in the hunt for the killer. ''[[The Times]]'' of 12 November 1888 reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Since the murders in [[Henriques Street|Berner Street]], St. Georges, and [[Mitre Square]], [[Aldgate]], on September 30th, Detective Inspectors [[Edmund Reid|Reid]], Moore and Nairn, and Sergeants Thick, Godley, M'Carthy and Pearce have been constantly engaged, under the direction of [[Frederick Abberline|Inspector Abberline]] (Scotland Yard), in prosecuting inquiries, but, unfortunately, up to the present time without any practical result. As an instance of the magnitude of their labours, each officer has had, on average, during the last six weeks to make some 30 separate inquiries weekly, and these have had to be made in different portions of the metropolis and suburbs. Since the two above-mentioned murders no fewer than 1,400 letters relating to the tragedies have been received by the police, and although the greater portion of these gratuitous communications were found to be of a trivial and even ridiculous character, still each one was thoroughly investigated. On Saturday (10th November) many more letters were received, and these are now being inquired into.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', &quot;The Whitechapel Murder&quot;, Issue 32541, 12 November 1888, p. 6 col. C.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Godley arrested poisoner [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]] in 1902 the then retired Inspector Abberline allegedly said &quot;You have caught Jack the Ripper at last&quot; or similar words.&lt;ref name=begg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8g6vSscwjT8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=george+godley+ripper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sTn1Zxcjj_&amp;sig=t4wu59NrA8eB8enZ-at5p6OUtxc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rhXqSpvmHs2ZjAez97ibDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20godley%20ripper&amp;f=false Odell, Robin ''Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer and a Literary Phenomenon'' Published by the Kent State University Press (2001) pg 67 ''[[Google Book Search|Google Books]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Godley retired on 20 January 1908 by which time he was an Inspector in K Division.&lt;ref name=Met&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/externalrequest.asp?requestreference=MEPO4/343 Piece details of MEPO 4/343], &quot;Metropolitan Police: Office of the Commissioner: Miscellaneous Books and Papers—Registers of Leavers, No. 8&quot;, ''The Catalogue'', [[The National Archives]].  Godley's details are listed on page 62. An [https://www.flickr.com/photos/naphotorecords/3291070407/in/set-72157614046081915/ image is available on] [[flickr]], and also a [http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=MEPO_4/343_Pages_61_and_62 transcription].&lt;/ref&gt; He died in July 1941 aged 83.

In 1881 he married Emma Adeline Mitchell (1863-1936). They had three children: Albert George Godley (1892-1972), Arthur Godley (born 1894) and Ella Adeline Godley (born 1897).&lt;ref name=Tree/&gt; His cousin was [[Sidney Frank Godley]] who won the [[Victoria Cross]] during [[World War I]].

==In fiction==
In the 1988 TV [[miniseries]] ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' starring [[Michael Caine]] Godley was played by [[Lewis Collins]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095388/ ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' on the [[Internet Movie Database]]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'', the character 'Peter Godley' played by [[Robbie Coltrane]] was based on George Godley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120681/ ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' on the [[Internet Movie Database]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Jefferson Hassell''' (July, 1888 &amp;ndash; February 10, 1928)&lt;ref name=&quot;TexasExec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/prefurman/electrocutions.htm |title=State of Texas Electrocutions 1923 - 1973 |publisher=tx.us |date=2000-03-02 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a convicted [[mass murder]]er who murdered his wife and eight children (ranging in age between two and 21 years old) on December 5, 1926  in [[Farwell, Texas]].

==Family background==
Hassell was born in [[Smithville, Texas]], the youngest of seven children. After his brother died from being kicked in the head by a [[mule]], he married his brother's widow, Susan Ferguson of [[Oklahoma]].

==Crime==
On the night of December 5, 1926, Hassell and his wife argued over his involvement with Ferguson's under-aged daughter. Hassell proceeded to strike his wife in the face repeatedly with a [[ballpeen hammer]]. After the murder of his wife he moved between each member of the family's beds, using a [[straight razor]] and [[stockings]] to kill them, in order from youngest to oldest. He woke the two eldest boys and a scuffle ensued, ending with Hassell killing them with a [[shotgun]] and an [[axe]]. All of the bodies were then stored in the newly dug [[root cellar]] by the house.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===The victims===
Susie, age 41&lt;br /&gt;
Alton, age 21&lt;br /&gt;
Virgil, age 15&lt;br /&gt;
Maudie, age 13&lt;br /&gt;
Russell, age 11&lt;br /&gt;
David, age 7&lt;br /&gt;
Johnnie, age 6&lt;br /&gt;
Nannie Martha, age 4&lt;br /&gt;
Samuel, age 22 months&lt;br /&gt;

===Arrest, trial, and execution===
Hassell claimed to the town he and his family were returning to Oklahoma, and sold all of their belongings in a large yard sale. During the auction a wagon ran over the sinkhole and aroused the suspicion of law enforcement. Soon afterward, Hassell attempted [[suicide]] but survived, and excavations revealed the remains in the root cellar.

After Hassell confessed, a short trial was convened, and Farwell and its sister city of [[Texico, New Mexico]] took on a carnival atmosphere. On February 10, 1928,&lt;ref name=&quot;TexasExec&quot;/&gt; George Hassell became the [[List of individuals executed in Texas, 1920–1929#By electrocution: 1924.E2.80.931929|37th man]] to be put to death in the [[electric chair]] in the state of Texas.

==Motive==
Hassell had a long history of criminal behavior, including the murder of another family in [[California]], [[embezzlement]] and military [[desertion]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}. According to his testimony his initial act was a crime of passion, and he killed the children to protect himself. A [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] report at the time characterizes him as a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">'''George Henry Lamson''' (8 September 1852 – 28 April 1882) was an American doctor and murderer.  

In his early career he had been a volunteer surgeon in [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]], and decorated for his work. He returned to England and practised in [[Bournemouth]]. He became addicted to [[morphine]] and his financial situation grew desperate.

In 1881 he visited his 18-year-old brother-in-law Percy John, a [[hemiplegia|hemiplegic]], at his boarding school and gave him a slice of [[Dundee cake]]. He also gave him a capsule from a batch that were later tested and found to contain the poison [[aconitine]], as recorded in the case history at Old Bailey Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/8361106.The_American_doctor__war_hero__drug_addict_and_murderer_who_lived_among_us/ |title=The American doctor, war hero, drug addict and murderer who lived among us |first=Stephen |last=Bailey |newspaper=Bournemouth Echo  |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamson was tried in March 1882 with [[Montagu Williams]] acting for his defence: he was found guilty of murdering Percy in order to secure a share of the family inheritance.  He had poisoned his victim with [[aconitine]] in the cake, a substance which Lamson had learnt about from Professor [[Robert Christison]] in university. Christison had taught that aconitine was undetectable but forensic science had improved since Lamson's student days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macinnis|first=Peter|title=It's true!: you eat poison every day|series=It's true|volume=18|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=2006|isbn=1-74114-626-7|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macinnis|first=Peter|title=Poisons: from hemlock to Botox and the killer bean of Calabar|publisher=Arcade Publishing|year=2005|isbn=1-55970-761-5|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry &amp; Wright (2000) p.103&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lamson's execution was delayed when word came that his family and friends in the United States requested time to send proof of insanity in the doctor's family and in his own life. The evidence was sent but was not sufficient to reduce the sentence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3039">'''George II''' ({{lang-ka|გიორგი II}}, ''Giorgi II'') also known as '''George the Bad, the Mad''' or '''the Evil''' (''Av-Giorgi'', ავგიორგი) (1464–1513), of the [[Bagrationi Dynasty]], was a [[List of sovereigns of Kakheti|king]] of [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] in eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] from 1511 to 1513.

He was the eldest son of King [[Alexander I of Kakheti]] by his wife Queen Ana. He is reported by the Georgian chronicles to have been extremely grasping and ambitious and to have had frequent conflicts with his peace-loving father, insisting that Alexander made war upon the rival Bagrationi branch presiding over Kakheti’s western neighbor, the [[Kingdom of Kartli (1484-1762)|Kingdom of Kartli]]. Also, he was suspicious of his younger brother, Demetre, whom Alexander had entrusted an important diplomatic mission to [[Safavid dynasty|Shah of Iran]], [[Ismail I]].

On April 27, 1511, George murdered Alexander, had Demetre blinded, and seized the crown. Immediately after his accession to the throne, George II organized an expedition against Kartli, and attempted to depose King [[David X of Kartli|David X]]. David’s brother, [[Bagrat I, Prince of Mukhrani]], who led the successful defense of the kingdom, was rewarded with the castle of [[House of Mukhrani|Mukhrani]], thus founding a long-lasting branch of Bagration-Mukhraneli. In 1513, George II made another incursion into Kartli, but was again defeated and ambushed by Bagrat’s men on his route back to Kakheti. George was put in the Mtveri castle where he soon died. Kakheti was briefly annexed to Kartli.&lt;ref&gt;Mikaberidze, Alexander (2007).

'''George Joseph Smith''' (11 January 1872 – 13 August 1915) was an [[English people|English]] [[serial killer]] and [[bigamy|bigamist]]. In 1915 he was [[criminal conviction|convicted]] and subsequently [[hanging|hanged]] for the slayings of three women, the case becoming known as the &quot;Brides in the Bath Murders&quot;. As well as being widely reported in the media, the case was significant in the history of [[forensic pathology]] and detection. It was also one of the first cases in which similarities between connected crimes were used to prove deliberation, a technique used in subsequent [[prosecution]]s.

== Early life and marriages ==
The son of an insurance agent, George Joseph Smith was born in [[Bethnal Green]], [[London]]. He was sent to a [[reformatory]] at [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]], at the age of nine and later served time for swindling and theft. In 1896, he was imprisoned for 12 months for persuading a woman to steal from her employers. He used the proceeds to open a [[baker]]'s shop in [[Leicester]].

In 1898, he married Caroline Beatrice Thornhill (under another alias, Oliver George Love) in Leicester; it was his only legal marriage (although he also married another woman bigamously the following year). They moved to [[London]], where she worked as a maid for a number of employers, stealing from them for her husband. She was eventually caught in [[Worthing]], [[Sussex]], and sentenced to 12 months. On her release, she incriminated her husband, and he was imprisoned in January 1901 for two years. On his release, she fled to [[Canada]]. Smith then went back to his other wife, cleared out her savings, and left.

In June 1908, Smith married Florence Wilson, a widow from [[Worthing]]. On 3 July, he left her, but not before taking [[£]]30 drawn from her [[savings account]] and selling her belongings from their [[Camden Town|Camden]] residence in London. On 30 July in [[Bristol]], he married Edith Peglar, who had replied to an advertisement for a [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]]. He would disappear for months at a time, saying that he was going to another city to ply his trade, which he claimed was selling [[antique]]s. In between his other marriages, Smith would always come back to Peglar with money.

In October 1909, he married Sarah Freeman, under the name George Rose Smith. As with Wilson, he left her after clearing out her savings and selling her [[war bond]]s, with a total take of £400. He then married Bessie Munday and Alice Burnham. In September 1914, he married Alice Reid, under the alias Charles Oliver James. In total, Smith entered into seven bigamous marriages between 1908 and 1914. In most of these cases, Smith went through his wives' possessions before he disappeared.

== Two similar deaths ==
In January 1915, Division [[Detective Inspector]] [[Arthur Neil]] received a letter from a Joseph Crossley, who owned a [[boarding house]] in [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]]. Included with the letter were two newspaper clippings: one was from the ''[[News of the World]]'' dated before [[Christmas]], 1914, about the death of '''Margaret Elizabeth Lloyd''' (née Lofty), aged 38, who died in her lodgings in 14 Bismarck Road, [[Highgate]], London (later renamed Waterlow Road). She was found in her bathtub by her husband, John Lloyd, and their [[landlady]].

The other clipping contained the report of a [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] dated 13 December 1913, in Blackpool. It was about a woman named '''Alice Smith''' (née Burnham), who died suddenly in a boarding house in that seaside resort while in her bathtub. She was found by her husband George Smith.

The letter, dated 3 January, was written by Crossley, the [[landlord]] of Mr and Mrs Smith, on behalf of Crossley's wife and a Mr. Charles Burnham, who both expressed their suspicion on the striking similarity of the two incidents and urged the police to investigate the matter.

== The hunt ==
On 17 December, Neil went to 14 Bismarck Road, where Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd had taken lodgings. He found it hard to believe that an adult like Mrs. Lloyd could have drowned in such a small tub, especially since the tub was three-quarters full when she was found. He then interviewed the [[coroner]], a Dr. Bates, who had signed the [[death certificate]], and asked if there were signs of violence on the woman. There were none except for a tiny bruise above the left elbow.

Upon further investigation, Neil learned that a [[will (law)|will]] had been made on the 18th, three hours before Margaret Lloyd died, and the sole [[beneficiary]] was her husband who had submitted the will to a lawyer &quot;for settlement&quot;. In addition, she had withdrawn all her savings on that same day.

On 12 January, Dr. Bates called Neil. He had had an inquiry from the [[Yorkshire]] [[Insurance]] Company regarding the death of Margaret Lloyd. She had, three days before she was married, taken out a [[life insurance]] policy for £700, with her husband John Lloyd as sole beneficiary. Neil promptly asked the doctor to delay his reply. At the same time, he requested more information on the Smith case from the Blackpool Police. Similarly, the late Mrs. Smith had earlier taken out a life insurance policy, and made a will in her husband's favour, and she took the lodgings in Blackpool only after Mr. Smith inspected the bathtub.

Neil asked the coroner to issue a favourable report to the insurance company. He was counting on the suspect to get in touch with his lawyer, and the office was watched day and night. On 1 February, a man fitting Lloyd/Smith's description appeared. Neil introduced himself and asked him whether he was John Lloyd. After Lloyd answered in the affirmative, Neil then asked him whether he was also George Smith. The man denied it vehemently. Neil, already sure that John Lloyd and George Smith were the same man, told him that he would take him for questioning on suspicion of bigamy. The man finally admitted that he was indeed George Smith, and was arrested.

== Spilsbury enters the case ==
When Smith was arrested for the charge of bigamy and suspicion of murder, the [[pathologist]] [[Bernard Spilsbury]] was asked to determine how the women died.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rose, Lethal Witness, Sutton Publishing 2007, Kent State University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was the [[Home Office]] [[pathologist]] and acted mainly in a consulting capacity, he was also available for direct assistance to the [[police force]].

Margaret Lloyd's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]], and Spilsbury's first task was to confirm [[drowning]] as the cause of death; and if so, whether by accident or by force. He confirmed the tiny bruise on the elbow as noted before, as well as two microscopic marks. Even the evidence of drowning was not extensive. There were no signs of [[heart disease|heart]] or [[circulatory disease]], but the evidence suggested that death was almost instantaneous, as if the victim died of a sudden [[stroke]]. Poison was also seen as a possibility, and Spilsbury ordered tests on its presence. Finally, he proposed to Neil that they run some experiments in the very same bathtub in which Margaret died. Neil had it set up in the [[police station]].

Newspaper reports about the &quot;Brides in the Baths&quot; began to appear. On 8 February, the [[chief police officer]] of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]], [[Kent]], a small seaside resort in [[Kent]], had read the stories, and sent Neil a report of another death which was strikingly similar to the other two.

== A third victim ==
A year before Burnham's death in Blackpool, one Henry Williams had rented a house with no bath in 80 High Street, for himself and his wife Beatrice &quot;Bessie&quot; Munday, whom he married in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[Dorset]] in 1910. He then rented a bathtub seven weeks later. He took his wife to a local doctor, Frank French, due to an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] fit, although she was only complaining of headaches, for which the doctor prescribed some medication. On 12 July 1912, Williams woke French, saying that his wife was having another fit. He checked on her, and promised to come back the following afternoon. However, he was surprised when, on the following morning, he was informed by Williams that his wife had died of drowning. The doctor found Bessie in the tub, her head underwater, her legs stretched out straight and her feet protruding out of the water. There was no trace of violence, so French attributed the drowning to epilepsy. The inquest [[jury]] awarded Williams the amount of £2,579 13s 7d (£2,579.68p), as stipulated in Mrs Williams' will, made up five days before her death.

Neil then sent photographs of Smith to Herne Bay for possible identification, and then went to Blackpool, where Spilsbury was conducting an [[autopsy]] of Alice Smith. The results were the same as with Margaret Lloyd: the lack of violence, every suggestion of instantaneous death, and little evidence of drowning. Furthermore, there were no traces of poison on Margaret Lloyd. Baffled, Spilsbury routinely took measurements of the corpse and had the tub sent to London.

Back in London, Neil had received confirmation from Herne Bay. &quot;Henry Williams&quot; was also &quot;John Lloyd&quot; and &quot;George Smith&quot;. This time, when Spilsbury examined Bessie Williams, he found one sure sign of drowning: the presence of [[Goose bumps|goose pimples]] on the skin. As with the other two deaths, the tub in which Mrs Williams had died was sent to London.

== Solution ==
For weeks Spilsbury pondered over the bathtubs and the victims' measurements. The first stage of an epileptic fit consists of a stiffening and extension of the entire body. Considering her height (5 feet, 7 inches) and the length of the tub (5 feet), the upper part of her body would have been pushed up the sloping head of the tub, far above the level of the water. The second stage consists of violent spasms of the limbs, which were drawn up to the body and then flung outward. Therefore, no one of her size could possibly get underwater, even when her muscles were relaxed, in the third stage: the tub was simply too small.

Using French's description of Bessie Williams when he found her in the bathtub, Spilsbury reasoned that Smith must have seized her by the feet and suddenly pulled them up toward himself, sliding the upper part of the body underwater. The sudden flood of water into her nose and throat might cause [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and sudden loss of consciousness, explaining the absence of injuries and minimal signs of drowning.

Neil hired several experienced female divers of the same size and build as the victims. He tried to push them underwater by force but there would be inevitable signs of struggle. Neil then unexpectedly pulled the feet of one of the divers, and her head glided underwater before she knew what happened. Suddenly Neil saw that the woman was no longer moving. He quickly pulled her out of the tub and it took him and a doctor over half an hour to revive her. When she came to, she related that the only thing she remembered was the rush of water before she lost consciousness. Thus was Spilsbury's theory confirmed.

George Joseph Smith was charged for the murders of Bessie Williams, Alice Smith and Margaret Lloyd on 23 March 1915.

== Trial and legal legacy ==
On 22 June, the trial began at the [[Old Bailey]]. The prosecuting Counsel were [[Archibald Bodkin]] (later [[Director of Public Prosecutions]]), [[Cecil Whiteley]] (later [[Queen's Counsel|KC]]) and [[Travers Humphreys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Encyclopedia of Murder|last= Wilson|first= Colin|authorlink= |author2=Patricia Pitman |year= 1984|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-28300-6|pages= 577–580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Trial of George Joseph Smith|last= Watson|first= ER (Ed)|authorlink= |year= 1922|publisher= [[William Hodge]]|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he could only be tried for the murder of Bessie Munday in accordance with [[English law]], the [[prosecution]] used the deaths of the other two to establish the pattern of Smith's crimes; this was allowed by Mr [[Thomas Edward Scrutton|Justice Scrutton]] despite the protests of Smith's [[barrister|counsel]], Sir [[Edward Marshall Hall]]. Smith decided not to give evidence in his own defence, indicating this to Marshall Hall in a handwritten note.(''pictured'')
[[File:Smith's instructions to counsel.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Smith's handwritten note to Marshall Hall]]

It took the jury about 20 minutes on 1 July to find him guilty; he was then [[death sentence|sentenced to death]]. Marshall Hall [[appeal]]ed on the grounds that the evidence of &quot;system&quot; has been improperly admitted, but [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Lord Reading LCJ]] dismissed the appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Famous cases: nine trials that changed the law | author1=Brian P. Block | author2=John Hostettler | publisher=Waterside Press| year=2002 | isbn=1-872870-34-1 | pages=225–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith was hanged in [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone Prison]] by hangman [[John Ellis (executioner)|John Ellis]].

The use of 'system'—comparing other crimes to the one a criminal is being tried for to prove guilt—set a [[precedent]] that was later used in other murder trials. For example, the doctor and suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams]] was charged for the murder of [[Edith Alice Morrell]], but the deaths of [[Gertrude Hullett]] and her husband Jack were used in the committal hearing to prove the existence of a pattern. This use of 'system' was later criticised by the trial judge when Adams was tried only on the Morrell charge.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin, Patrick. Easing the passing: The trial of Doctor John Bodkin Adams, London, The Bodley Head, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==

In his book ''[[Why Britain is at War]]'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Why Britain is at War&quot; (1939) by Harold Nicolson, republished as ISBN 978-0-14-104896-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Nicolson]] used the behaviour of George Smith and his repeatedly murderous behaviour as a parallel to Hitler's repeatedly acquisitive behaviour in Europe in the 1930s.
In Evelyn Waugh's book ''Unconditional Surrender'', which is set during the Second World War, General Whale is referred to as &quot;Brides-in-the-bath&quot; because all the operations he sponsored seemed to require the extermination of all involved.

The Smith case is mentioned in Dorothy L. Sayers' mysteries, ''[[Unnatural Death]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''[[Unnatural Death]]'', Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Busman's Honeymoon]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''[Busman's Honeymoon]'', Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also mentioned in Agatha Christie's novels ''A Caribbean Mystery'' and ''The Murder on the Links''. It is also mentioned on Patricia Highsmith's novel ''A Suspension of Mercy'' at page 63: &quot;Not for him the Smith brides-in-a-bath murders for peanuts.&quot; The crimes of George Joseph Smith also feature in William Trevor's novel ''The Children of Dynmouth'' in which the sociopathic protagonist plans to re-enact the crimes as part of the community's Easter Fete. On page 273 of Monica Ferris's novel &quot;The Drowning Spool,&quot; it mentions &quot;a certain George Joseph Smith&quot; who is discovered through the work of &quot;a very clever forensic investigator back then.&quot; [[Margery Allingham]]'s short story &quot;Three Is a Lucky Number&quot; (1955) adapts the events and refers to James Joseph Smith and his Brides. The Smith case was dramatised on the radio series ''[[The Black Museum]]'' in 1952 under the title of ''The Bath Tub''. Czechoslovak Television's series ''Adventures of Criminology'' (1990), based on famous criminal cases in which new methods of investigation were used, depicts this case in the episode ''Reconstruction''.

A missing episode of ''[[Dead of Night (TV series)|Dead of Night]]'' (1972), a [[BBC2]] paranormal anthology series, entitled ''Smith'' concerned Smith's spirit possessing a man and re-enacting one of his murders. There was also ''[[The Brides in the Bath]]'' (2003), a TV film made by [[Yorkshire Television]], starring [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]] as George Smith and the play [[Tryst (drama)|''Tryst'']] by [[Karoline Leach]], first  produced in New York in 2006, starring [[Maxwell Caulfield]] and [[Amelia Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wild-reality.net/tryst/ |title=TRYST |publisher=wild-reality.net |accessdate=2010-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This story is the basis for the play ''The Drowning Girls'' by Beth Graham, Charlie Tomlinson, Daniela Vlaskalic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/stage/2009/10/16/11420751-sun.html | journal=Toronto Sun | date=16 October 2009 | author=John Coulbourn | title=

For some years his waxwork was exhibited in the [[Chamber of Horrors (Madame Tussauds)|Chamber of Horrors]] at [[Madame Tussauds]] in London.

'''George Akin Lusk''' (1839–1919) was a builder and [[interior decorator|decorator]] who specialised in [[music hall]] restoration, and was the [[Chairman]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] during the 'Whitechapel Murders' of [[Jack the Ripper]] in 1888.

==Background==
Lusk was the son of Margaret Elizabeth ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Murray) (born 1807) and John Arthur Lusk (born 1803), a solicitor's clerk. In January 1863 he married Susannah Price (1843&amp;ndash;5 February 1888)&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/iexec?htx=View&amp;r=5538&amp;dbid=1904&amp;iid=31874_222776-00452&amp;fn=Susannah&amp;ln=Lusk&amp;st=r&amp;ssrc=&amp;pid=278422  England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966 Record for Susannah Lusk -  [[Ancestry.co.uk]]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stepney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/browse/view.aspx?dbid=1623&amp;iid=31280_194771-00088&amp;pid=2100340&amp;ssrc=&amp;fn=George+Aken&amp;ln=Lusk&amp;st=g London Metropolitan Archives London, England, Marriages and Banns, 1754-1921 Record for George Aken Lusk [[Ancestry.co.uk]]]&lt;/ref&gt; They had seven children: Albert Arthur Lusk (1863-1930); Walter Leopold Lusk (1865-1923); George Alfred Lusk (1870-1918); Edith Rose Lusk (1872-?); Maud Florence B. Lusk (1875-1967); Selina Grace Lusk (1877-?), and Lilian Violet Lusk (1881-1962).

Lusk was a [[Freemason]], having been initiated into the Doric Lodge on 14 April 1882, but he was excluded from his membership of the Lodge in 1889 for non-payment of dues.&lt;ref name=MQM&gt;[http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-2/p-49.php MQ MAGAZINE Issue 2 - Jack the Ripper: Exploring the Masonic link&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.mqmagazine.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the [[Churchwarden]] of his local church.&lt;ref name=MQM/&gt;

==Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee==
Lusk was elected Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] by other local businessmen who made up the Committee on 10 September 1888. His name was printed on the numerous posters pasted up around [[Whitechapel]] appealing for information during the murders. He and the Committee's Treasurer, Joseph Aarons, wrote a letter to  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', addressed to the then [[Home Secretary]] [[Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff|Henry Matthews]], stating that the offer of a substantial reward from the government would &quot;convince the poor and humble residents of our East-end that the government authorities are as much anxious to avenge the blood of these unfortunate women as they were the [[assassination]] of [[Lord Frederick Cavendish|Lord Cavendish]] and [[Thomas Henry Burke (civil servant)|Mr Burke]].&quot;

==From Hell letter==
{{main article|From Hell letter}}
[[Image:FromHellLetter.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;The 'From Hell' letter sent to Lusk&lt;/center&gt;]]
In October 1888 Lusk came to believe that his house was being watched by a sinister bearded man, and requested police protection. He received a small package in the evening mail at his home, 1 Alderney Road, Mile End. On opening the package he found a letter addressed to himself, inside which was half a human [[kidney]]. The letter read:

:&quot;From hell

:Mr Lusk
:Sor
:I send you half the Kidne I took from one women prasarved it for you tother pirce I fried and ate it was very nise I may send you the bloody knif that took it out if you only wate a whil longer.

:signed  Catch me when 
:you Can 
:Mishter Lusk.&quot;

This letter is referred to as the &quot;[[From Hell letter]]&quot; by Ripperologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4042087.stm  'Why are we obsessed with Jack the Ripper?' [[BBC News]] 26 November 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced the letter was a practical joke, Lusk placed the box and the kidney in his desk drawer. At a meeting of the Vigilance Committee the next day he showed it to other members of the Committee. Joseph Aarons, W Harris and two other members called Reeves and Lawton visited Lusk at home to inspect the letter and the kidney. Lusk wanted to throw both away, but he was persuaded to take them to Dr Frederick Wiles, who had a surgery nearby on the Mile End Road.

Wiles was out, so his assistant, F S Reed examined the contents of the box and took the kidney to Dr. [[Thomas Horrocks Openshaw]] at the nearby [[London Hospital]]. The kidney was handed over to the [[City of London Police|City Police]] in whose jurisdiction [[Catherine Eddowes]] had been murdered.

Lusk is also mentioned in the 17 September 1888 'Dear Boss' letter, but this letter is regarded by many Ripperologists as being a modern hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casebook.org/ripper_letters/ Casebook: Jack the Ripper - Ripper Letters&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.casebook.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television portrayals==
*In the 1988 [[made for TV]] film ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]], Lusk was played by [[Michael Gothard]]. During the film, Lusk is portrayed as a violent Marxist and power hungry politician, though in real life he was known for his peaceful nature.
*In the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'', starring [[Johnny Depp]], Lusk was played by [[Vincent Franklin]].
*In [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Ripper Street]]'' (2013) he was played by [[Michael Smiley]], who reconvenes the Vigilance Committee, in spite of its official disbandment, to persecute a young boy suspected of a violent murder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2931">'''Jerome Bannigan''' (d. 1970), aka '''George Andrew McMahon''', was an Irish &quot;fraudster,&quot; and &quot;fanaticist,&quot; and would-be assassin of King [[Edward VIII]]. On 16 July 1936 he pulled a gun as the king was riding through [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] after leaving an army parade during the [[Trooping the Colour|Colour]] ceremony. Police and bystanders acted and managed to subdue McMahon after a struggle, and an unfired revolver fell near the feet of the King's carriage as he continued safely down [[Constitution Hill, London|Constitution Hill]]. McMahon, denounced in 1940 as a Nazi sympathizer [[citation needed]], claimed he had been angered by the [[Home Secretary]]'s alleged failure to respond to his reports of a plot to kill the King and later claimed to have been working with [[MI5]].

McMahon had earlier attempted to provide questionable evidence of Irish and Republican plots against the British government, including a claim of plans to ship weapons to the [[Irish Free State]] in 1935 as well as reports of Italian agents operating from the Italian embassy, before publishing [[anti-semitic]] literature and other letters to ''[[Daily Worker (UK newspaper)|The Daily Worker]]''.

Although under the attention of the [[MI5|Security Service]], his warnings against a supposed assassination plot by Communists were ignored and, two days later, he managed to throw a loaded revolver at the King during a parade before being arrested by the [[Metropolitan Police]] on 16 July 1936.

McMahon was subsequently sentenced to 12 months imprisonment; shortly after his release, however, he continued his subversive activities. During November 1939, he claimed in a letter to have had a personal audience with senior Nazi official [[Julius Streicher]] the previous year, and offered information from that meeting to British authorities.

The following year, he began sending anti-Semitic letters (which included an attack on Minister of War [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]]) using War Office [[letterhead]]s on the pretext of official government communications. McMahon continued to be under the surveillance of the Security Service between 1945 and 1951, and they intercepted several letters including one to [[Oswald Mosley]].

'''George C. &quot;Tiny&quot; Mercer''' (August 31, 1944 &amp;ndash; January 6, 1989) was President of two motorcycle clubs in [[Belton, Missouri]]: the Missing Links and Rancid Riders. Mercer was convicted for the rape and murder of 22-year-old Karen Keeton in [[Belton, Missouri]], United States, on August 31, 1978. At the time of the murder, Mercer had a charge pending against him of raping a 17-year-old girl. He was executed at the age of 44 by the state of [[Missouri]] by [[lethal injection]]. He became the first person to be executed in Missouri since 1965. His execution was carried out in the former gas chamber which was converted to use lethal injection.

'''George Nassar''' (born June 1932) is an [[United States|American]] murderer; [[Albert DeSalvo]] allegedly confessed to being the [[Boston Strangler]] to Nassar in late 1965. Nassar contacted his lawyer [[F. Lee Bailey]] and informed him of this confession, which led to DeSalvo becoming the prime suspect in the unsolved Strangler murders.

== Life ==
===Early life===

Nassar was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], the oldest of two children of Henry Nassar and Helen (née George), both of [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] descent. Henry had come to America with his parents as a child and worked at various [[textile mill|mill]]s in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. He would pass away there in 1955. Helen was born in [[Dover, New Hampshire]] and worked as a [[bobbin]] setter in mills; a previous marriage (that ended in 1931) to a man named Lawrence Otis, yielded one son named after his father. Nassar has one sister named Eileen. Eileen and George grew up in Lawrence, and were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s. George was involved in sports, and was a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]]. At school, his teachers found him reserved, quiet, and a poor mixer.

===First murder===

George first ran afoul of the law while he was in his sophomore year. In May 1948, he and two of his friends, [[Gennaro Pullino]] and William Kenney went on a robbery spree that netted eighty dollars. In one of the places they hit, shopowner Dominic Kirmil lunged at the trio with a Coke bottle; Nassar pulled out a nickel-plated revolver from his dark-colored trench coat and shot Kirmil four times. The shopkeeper died three hours later from the loss of blood. Several witnesses described Nassar's distinct trench coat to the police.

On May 20, Nassar was picked up by Lawrence patrolmen Charles Keenan and Walter Sliva after crashing a stolen car on [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] in [[Ayer, Massachusetts]]. Initially charged with [[auto theft]], Nassar soon became a prominent suspect in the Kirmil murder. The police found two thirty-eight-caliber bullets in his pocket, and the nickel-plated [[revolver]] used in the murder in the wrecked car. Nassar and his friends Pullino and Kenney were indicted and pleaded guilty to a [[second degree murder]] charge. They were formally sentenced to [[life in prison]].

Nassar was sent to the prison MCI-Norfolk in [[Norfolk, Massachusetts]]. Once there, Nassar formed a friendship with [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister William Moors and joined the Prison's Debating Society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2011-07/NorfolkPrisonDebateTeam.html&lt;/ref&gt; Through the efforts of Moors, Nassar was [[parole]]d early in 1961. The Boston Strangler slayings would begin the following year.

===Hilton's murder===

On September 29, 1964, Nassar brutally murdered 44-year-old [[Texaco]] station owner Irvin Hilton in full view of Rita Buote and her 14-year-old daughter Diane. As Buote pulled in to the station, Nassar fired one shot into the kneeling Hilton, and three more after he crumpled to the floor. Then he approached Buote's car, and tried to get her to open up. Failing, he jumped into another car and drove off toward [[North Andover, Massachusetts|North Andover]]. A truck driver, William King, wrote down the plate number and called the police.

The getaway car was found later that evening on a street in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]] next to [[Phillips Academy]]. The police soon learned that the car had been stolen earlier that day from near the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. The car belonged to a navy lieutenant who was attending MIT. A thirty-two-caliber nickel-plated [[Harrington &amp; Richardson]] revolver and a twenty-two caliber [[Astra-Unceta y Cia SA|Astra]] [[semi-automatic pistol]] were found underneath the front seat of the car. Shells from the revolver were found at the crime scene and matched the bullets found in Hilton.

An [[autopsy]] on Hilton revealed that he had been shot six times at close range, and stabbed in the back. The police theorized that the murderer had made Hilton beg for his life while shooting him.

A description given by Rita and Diane Buote enabled Andover police officer William Tammany to draw a composite of the killer. On spotting the drawing, Nassar's former arresting officer Keenan was struck by its familiarity. He went through his files and came up with a photograph of Nassar, which the Buotes positively identified as the man they saw shooting Hilton.

Nassar was found living in the [[Mattapan, Massachusetts|Mattapan]] section of [[Boston]]. The Andover, Lawrence, and state police contacted the Boston police department, and got a warrant at [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] District Court to search the suspect's car and his apartment on 51 Deering Road. When the police arrived, they found Nassar with a [[social worker]]. A hunting knife was also located and confiscated.

Nassar was subsequently arrested and sent to Bridgewater to await his trial. He was said to have [[schizophrenic]] tendencies and was put under observation when he met DeSalvo. On June 26, 1965, a jury found Nassar guilty of Hilton's murder, with no recommendation for mercy. He received the [[death sentence]], and was placed on [[Death Row]] at [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Cedar Junction|Walpole State Prison]] pending appeal. On June 7, 1966, his sentence was struck down by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and later changed to [[life imprisonment]].

===Later life===

Nassar was convicted in 1967 of murder in the first degree and that conviction was upheld following plenary or de novo review.&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth v. Nassar'', 354 Mass. 249, 237 N.E.2d 39 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1039, 89 S.Ct. 662, 21 L.Ed.2d 586 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1982, Nassar filed an unsuccessful ''pro se'' motion for a new trial.  When that motion was denied Nassar filed a one-sentence “motion for leave to appeal,” which was effectively abandoned.

Nassar and other Massachusetts prisoners were transferred to federal custody in the summer of 1980.  Nassar and seven other prisoners successfully challenged the transfers in a 1981 civil suit.  Because the prisoners did not receive reclassification hearings and other procedures mandated by Massachusetts law, they were returned to Massachusetts custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Blake v. Commissioner of Correction,'' 390 Mass. 537, 457 N.E.2d 281 (Mass. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nassar was being held in federal prison in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], as recently as 1983.  Nassar is currently at [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Shirley]].

After a twenty-year period, Nassar moved again for a new trial, which motion was denied.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in affirming the denial of the motion, wrote:  “Nassar claimed in his motion that he was unable, in 1983, to show good cause not to dismiss the matter because at that time, he was incarcerated in the Federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, without access to Massachusetts legal materials.  However, he was returned to Massachusetts in December, 1983, but did not seek to reopen the matter or inquire as to its status at that time, or at any time thereafter for over twenty years. We perceive no error or abuse of discretion in declining to reopen the proceedings after such a long period of inaction.” &lt;ref&gt;''Massachusetts v. Nassar,'' 450 Mass. 1031, 1032, 880 N.E.2d 793, 794-95 (Mass. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nassar's appeal was denied by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on February 15, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;masjc&quot;&gt;[http://www.eagletribune.com/punews/local_story_047065825.html ''Appeal denied for jailhouse confidant of reputed Boston Strangler''.]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Lawrence Eagle-Tribune.  ''See also Massachusetts v. Nassar,'' 450 Mass. 1031, 880 N.E.2d 793 (Mass. 2008) (also discussing other appeals by Nassar).

'''George Robert''' &quot;'''Bob'''&quot; '''Dekle, Sr.''' (born May 23, 1948) was an [[State's Attorney#Assistant State's Attorneys|Assistant State Attorney]] in [[Third Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Florida's Third Judicial Circuit]] from 1975 through 2005, and the lead prosecuting attorney in the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1980 [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; murder trial of [[serial killer]] [[Ted Bundy]] which ultimately delivered the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] that was carried out in 1989. Dekle's book on the case, ''The Last Murder: The Investigation, Prosecution, and Execution of Ted Bundy'', was published in 2011.

Dekle served as a Legal Skills Professor at [[Fredric G. Levin College of Law|Levin College of Law]], [[University of Florida]], from 2006 through June 2016. He writes books on [[trial advocacy]] and legal history and has lectured extensively nationwide. Dekle is also a [[chess variant]] inventor.

==Early life==
Dekle was born May 23, 1948 in [[Gainesville, Florida]], the eldest child of Donald James and Anne Coleman Dekle. He has one brother, William Ervin Dekle, and one sister, Lucy Dekle Daniels. Dekle lived with his family on a farm in [[Lake Butler, Union County, Florida]]. Dekle's mother was a teacher; his father was a deputy in Lake Butler and also a colonel with the Department of Corrections. Dekle's grandfather was a sheriff in Union County; his great-grandfather was a teacher and also a county judge.&lt;ref name=LCR2006 /&gt; At the age of 9 or 10, Dekle was inspired about the possibility of a law career: while visiting a small town with his family, he saw a building with lots of books behind the picture window, and learned from his father that it was a law office. &quot;Even at that age, I was a bookworm, and I thought it would be wonderful to have a job where you worked with so many books.&quot; In 7th or 8th grade, he skipped school to watch the [[closing argument]]s of a double [[murder]] trial in Lake Butler. &quot;I came away knowing that I wanted to be three things: a lawyer, a trial lawyer, and a prosecutor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trialtheater&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trialtheater.com/articles/dekle.htm |author=Wilcox, Elliott |title=Five Questions with... George R. (Bob) Dekle |publisher=Trial Theater, LLC |date=2012 |accessdate=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 Dekle's family moved to [[Lake City, Florida]], where he played [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|defensive guard]] on the Lake City [[Columbia High School (Lake City, Florida)|Columbia High School]] (CHS) football team.

==Education==
After graduating from CHS in 1966, Dekle completed a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in history from the [[University of Florida, Gainesville|University of Florida]] (UF) in 1970. As a freshman in 1966 he played [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Florida Gators]] freshmen football team, which went 4–0 that season. After completing his B.A. he taught history at CHS for one year. Dekle then returned to UF and completed a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1973.

==Career==
From 1973 to 1975, Dekle was Assistant [[Public defender (United States)|Public Defender]] of the [[Third Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Third Judicial Circuit of Florida]]. He became [[State's Attorney#Assistant State's Attorneys|Assistant State Attorney]] for the Third Circuit in 1975, serving 30 years until retiring in 2005. As Assistant State Attorney, Dekle investigated and prosecuted a wide variety of criminal cases. From 2006 through June 2016 he has been Legal Skills Professor at the University of Florida, [[Fredric G. Levin College of Law|Levin College of Law]], overseeing the Prosecution Clinic.

Dekle has lectured extensively to prosecutor's associations nationwide. He has also served as faculty at the National Advocacy Center in Columbia, South Carolina. In an interview in 2016, Dekle summarized the hardest lesson he learned as a trial lawyer:&lt;ref name=trialtheater /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] you should try your case, not fight opposing counsel. Cordiality to opposing counsel usually makes it easier to try your case. Sometimes opposing counsel won't allow you to be cordial, but whenever you can you should try your case with an air of collegial professionalism.&lt;/blockquote&gt; and a lesson that he would like to pass on to new trial lawyers:&lt;blockquote&gt; You have a job to do as a prosecutor, and sometimes the people and incidents you deal with aren't very pretty. But you should never lose sight of the fact that a prosecutor is a minister of justice, not a vigilante avenger.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''State of Florida v. Theodore Robert Bundy'' {{anchor|Ted Bundy case}}===
{{further|Ted Bundy}}
The trial of [[Ted Bundy]] in Orlando was the second murder trial of serial killer Bundy, who had previously been convicted and received two death sentences for two homicides in the Chi Omega proceedings in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] in June 1979. The Orlando trial, for the February 9, 1978 abduction and [[Murder#Murder#Degrees of murder|first degree murder]] in Lake City of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach, the youngest and last Bundy victim, occurred six months later, from January to February 1980. Dekle led the prosecution team. Bundy was found guilty on all counts and was sentenced with death for a third time. After multiple stays of execution by the [[Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], and being upheld on appeal, the sentence was carried out nearly nine years later on January 24, 1989 by [[Electric chair|electrocution]] at [[Florida State Prison]].

The Bundy case was Dekle's first Murder I prosecution. At age 30 and with three years experience as a prosecutor, he worked intensely on trial preparation from 1978 to 1980. &quot;That's where I learned to be a lawyer—prosecuting that case.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Voyles |first=Karen |date=2011-09-11 |title=Getting Bundy: UF professor writes book about his most famous case |newspaper=Gainesville Sun |location=[[Gainesville, Florida]] |page=3D}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;It was such a vast-sprawling case that I had an opportunity to learn all kinds of aspects of criminal trial practice and all aspects of forensic science that probably would've taken years to learn about otherwise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LCR2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Downey |first=Lindsay |date=2006-01-29 |title=A love for the law |newspaper=[[Lake City Reporter]] |location=[[Lake City, Florida]] |pages=1C, 3C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the more than 350 jury trials in which Dekle had been lead counsel, the Bundy case was his most memorable. Fibers with an unusual manufacturing flaw allowed Dekle to connect Bundy's jacket to Bundy's van and to Kimberly Leach's body. The presentation of fiber evidence was the most memorable moment in Dekle's career as trial lawyer.&lt;ref name=trialtheater /&gt;

====''The Last Murder''====
In his book ''The Last Murder: The Investigation, Prosecution, and Execution of Ted Bundy'', published May 2011, Dekle conveys that a successful third conviction in the circumstantial evidence case was anything but certain. He documents the enormous amount of work and preparation needed for the high-profile case, including the intricacies and complexities of investigation and prosecution, often across multiple states and jurisdictions. According to Hon. Michael D. Marcus (ret.), author of ''Trial Preparation for Prosecutors'':{{efn|{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=Hon. Michael D. |authorlink= |title=Trial Preparation for Prosecutors |edition=3rd |publisher=LexisNexis |year=2010 |isbn=978-157911183-0}}}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Dekle takes the reader &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to show that homicide investigations are arduous, unglamorous processes that can be sidetracked by both dead end leads and bureaucratic pettiness and that the resulting trials often experience unexpected legal and evidentiary potholes. Bundy's eventual conviction is a testament to dogged hard work by Dekle, his fellow prosecutors and assisting law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A3570C |title=The Last Murder |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date= |accessdate=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dekle's first objective for his book was to tell a Lake City story that &quot;needed to be told&quot;.&lt;ref name=LCR2011 /&gt; The book is an &quot;easy read&quot; according to ''[[Lake City Reporter]]'' publisher Todd Wilson, while also a detailed historical chronicle of events. Dekle credits numerous law enforcement agents, prosecutors, and investigators who worked closely on the case for contributing to its success. His second objective was &quot;to offer guidance to any young prosecutor&quot;. The book is classified as a textbook.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCR2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Todd |date=2011-06-12 |title=The Last Murder |newspaper=[[Lake City Reporter]] |location=[[Lake City, Florida]] |pages=1D–2D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 case did not have the benefit of [[DNA testing]], which was developed later. Dekle: &quot;It is a case that would have been a slam dunk today because of DNA, but it is also a look at how to proceed with a capital case.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sun /&gt;

Dekle dedicated his book &quot;''To the memory of Kimberly Diane Leach''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Dekle |first = George R. Sr. |title = The Last Murder: The Investigation, Prosecution, and Execution of Ted Bundy |year = 2011 |publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]] |edition = Hardcover |page = v |isbn = 978-031339743-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*:Dekle explained the background about writing this book: &lt;blockquote&gt;When I retired as a prosecutor back in 2005 and began my second career as a legal skills professor at the University of Florida, Levin College of Law, I began casting about looking for historical trials to use as illustrations of various points concerning the principles of good prosecution. One salient point that every prosecutor should know is that sometimes justice is better served by declining to prosecute an accused who is obviously guilty. The trial of Jesus appeared to be a prime example of this point. A fair reading of the Gospels seemed to indicate that Jesus was clearly guilty of violating the '''''lex iulia maiestas''''', a minor form of treason, but just as clearly unworthy of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Dekle |first = George R. Sr. |title = The Case against Christ: A Critique of the Prosecution of Jesus |year = 2011 |publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing |page = xiii |isbn = 978-144383194-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I read every account of criminal trials of the first century that I could find. Jesus was basically charged with treason and there were about 40 of these type of trials documented, so I studied the details of these and read descriptions of 127 other similar ancient trials. I went all the way back to the trial of Socrates, around 300 B.C. and started there because his trial was very similar to the trial of Jesus.&lt;ref name=LCR2011 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3351">'''George Sitts''' (October 29, 1913 -  April 8, 1947) was executed at the age of 33 by the [[U.S. state]] of [[South Dakota]] for the [[murder]] of state Division of Criminal Investigation special agent Tom Matthews, who was attempting to arrest Sitts on a fugitive warrant from [[Minnesota]]. 

He was the only person to die in South Dakota's [[electric chair]], and it would be a little over 60 years until the next time South Dakota would carry out an execution — [[Elijah Page]] via [[lethal injection]] on July 11, 2007.

Sitts, who escaped from prison while serving a life sentence for murder, also shot and killed [[Butte County, South Dakota|Butte County]] Sheriff Dave Malcolm near [[Spearfish, South Dakota|Spearfish]], on January 24, 1946. Sitts was convicted in Minnesota for the 1945 murder of a liquor store clerk during a botched robbery.

After spending three weeks sawing on the bars of his cell in the [[Minneapolis]] city jail, Sitts and three other men broke out the day before Sitts was scheduled to be transferred to a state prison. 

After the slayings of Matthews and Malcolm, Sitts fled to [[Wyoming]], where he was arrested on February 5, 1946, and returned to South Dakota. Sitts was tried first for the murder of Matthews and after his conviction and death sentence in March 1946, the state opted not to try him for Malcolm's murder.

South Dakota introduced the electric chair as the manner of execution in 1939 and Sitts was the fourth man sentenced to die in the chair. The three previous sentences, however, were commuted to life in prison.

Sitts's final words were a wry joke to the 41 official witnesses.  &quot;This is the first time authorities helped me escape prison,&quot; he said right before the four shocks surged through his body at 12:15 a.m.

Special Agent Matthews name is inscribed on Panel 34 of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial located on [[Judiciary Square]], [[Washington, D.C.]] Sheriff Malcolm's name is inscribed on Panel 53.

'''George Junius Stinney Jr.''' (October 21, 1929 – June 16, 1944), was a 14 year old African-American convicted of murder as a result of a racially-biased and discriminatory trial in 1944 in his home town of [[Alcolu, South Carolina]]. He was the youngest person in the United States in the 20th-century to be sentenced to death and to be executed.&lt;ref name=banner&gt;{{cite news |last=Banner |first=Stuart |date=March 5, 2005 |title=When Killing a Juvenile Was Routine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2005/03/05/weekinreview/20050306_BANNER_CHART.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |archive-date=April 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412063127/http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2005/03/05/weekinreview/20050306_BANNER_CHART.html |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was denied appeal and executed by [[electric chair]].

Since Stinney's conviction and execution the question of his guilt, the validity of his reported confession, and the judicial process leading to his execution have been extensively criticized.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite news |last=Collins |first=Jeffrey |date=January 18, 2010 |title=SC crusaders look to right Jim Crow justice wrongs |url=http://www.goupstate.com/article/20100118/ARTICLES/100119732 |agency=AP |publisher=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |archive-date=May 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529172647/http://www.goupstate.com/article/20100118/articles/100119732 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of lawyers and activists investigated the Stinney case on behalf of his family. In 2013 the family petitioned for a new trial. On December 17, 2014, his conviction was posthumously [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] 70 years after his execution, because the circuit court judge ruled that he had not been given a fair trial; he had no effective defense and his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights had been violated.&lt;ref name=wis&gt;{{cite web |last=Turnage |first=Jeremy |date=December 17, 2014 |url=http://www.wistv.com/story/27651255/george-stinney-14-year-old-convicted-of-44-murder-exonerated |title=George Stinney, 14-year-old convicted of '44 murder, exonerated |publisher=[[WIS]] |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223031/http://www.wistv.com/story/27651255/george-stinney-14-year-old-convicted-of-44-murder-exonerated |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccloud&gt;{{cite news |last=McCloud |first=Harriet |date=December 17, 2014 |title=South Carolina judge tosses conviction of black teen executed in 1944

==Case background==
In 1944 George Junius Stinney, Jr. lived in [[Alcolu, South Carolina|Alcolu]], [[Clarendon County, South Carolina]]. The 14-year-old African-American boy lived with his father, George Stinney, Sr., mother Aime, brothers Charles, age 12, and John, age 17, and sisters Katherine, age 10, and Aime, age 7. George Sr. worked at the town's sawmill, and the family lived in housing provided by George Sr.'s employer. Alcolu was a small, working-class mill town, where white and black neighborhoods were separated by railroad tracks. The town was typical of small Southern towns of the time, with separate schools and churches for white and black residents, who rarely interacted.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt; 

The bodies of Betty June Binnicker, age 11, and Mary Emma Thames, age 8, were found in a ditch on the black side of Alcolu on March 23, 1944. They had been beaten with an improvised weapon variously reported as a piece of blunt metal or a railroad spike.&lt;ref name=bever /&gt; The girls were last seen riding their bicycles looking for flowers. As they passed the Stinney property, they asked young George Stinney and his sister, Aime,&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt; if they knew where to find &quot;[[Passiflora incarnata|maypops]]&quot;, a local name for passionflowers.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; According to Aime, she was with George at the time of the murders.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt;    

When the girls did not return home, search parties were organized. George's father was among the searchers.&lt;ref name=collins /&gt; The bodies of the girls were found the next morning, on the black side of town, in a ditch filled with muddy water. According to an article reported by the wire services on March 24, 1944, and published widely, with the mistake of the boy's name preserved, the sheriff announced the arrest and said that &quot;George Junius&quot; had confessed and led officers to &quot;a hidden piece of iron.&quot;&lt;ref name=ins /&gt;&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; Both girls had suffered [[Blunt trauma|blunt force trauma]] to the face and head.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Mark R. |title=South Carolina Killers: Crimes of Passion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YdF1MePkfoC&amp;pg=PA38 |accessdate=November 24, 2014 |year=2007 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |isbn=978-1-59629-395-3 |pages=38–42 |chapter=Chapter Five: Too Young to Die: The Execution of George Stinney, Jr. (1944)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports differed as to what kind of weapon had been used.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt; According to a report by the medical examiner, these wounds had been &quot;inflicted by a blunt instrument with a round head, about the size of a hammer.&quot; Both girls' skulls were punctured. The girls had not been sexually assaulted and their hymens were intact. The medical examiner reported the genitalia of the older girl were slightly bruised.&lt;ref name=mclaughlin&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Eliot C.|date=January 23, 2014 |title=New trial sought for George Stinney, executed at 14 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/21/us/george-stinney-hearing/ |website=[[CNN]] |archive-date=April 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410224104/http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/21/us/george-stinney-hearing/ |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent&gt; {{cite news |last=Walker |first=Tim |date=January 22, 2014 |title=George Stinney: After 70 years, justice in sight for boy America sent to electric chair |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/after-70-years-justice-in-sight-for-boy-america-sent-to-electric-chair-9078460.html |website=[[The Independent]] |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305021418/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/after-70-years-justice-in-sight-for-boy-america-sent-to-electric-chair-9078460.html |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
George Stinney was arrested on suspicion of murdering the girls along with his older brother Johnny. Johnny was released, George was held and not allowed to see his parents until after his trial and conviction.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt; According to a handwritten statement, the arresting officer was H.S. Newman, a Clarendon County deputy, who stated &quot;I arrested a boy by the name of George Stinney. He then made a confession and told me where to find a piece of iron about 15 inches were [sic] he said he put it in a ditch about six feet from the bicycle.&quot; No confession statement signed by Stinney is known to exist.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt;&lt;ref name=mclaughlin /&gt;

George was reported to have gotten into fights at school, including a fight where he scratched a girl with a knife. This assertion by Stinney's seventh-grade teacher, who was black, was disputed by Aime Stinney Ruffner when it was reported in 1995. A local white woman who remembered Stinney from childhood said Stinney had threatened to kill her and her friend the day before the murder, and that he was known as a bully.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt;&lt;ref name=behre&gt;{{Cite web |last=Behre |first=Robert |date=January 17, 2014 |title=Family, friends of 1944 murder victim wary of reopening George Stinney’s death penalty case |url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140117/PC1610/140119506 |website=[[The Post and Courier]] |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603111624/http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140117/PC1610/140119506 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following George's arrest, his father was fired from his job at the local sawmill, and the Stinney family had to immediately vacate the housing provided by Stinney Sr's employer. The family feared for their safety. His parents did not see George again before the trial. He had no support during his 81-day confinement and trial; he was kept at a jail in Columbia 50 miles from town because of the risk of lynching.&lt;ref name=collins /&gt; Stinney was questioned alone, without his parents or an attorney.&lt;ref name=bever /&gt; Although the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] guarantees legal counsel, it was not until 1963 that ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' explicitly required representation through the course of criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name=bever /&gt;

==Trial==
The entire proceeding against Stinney, including jury selection, took one day. Stinney's court-appointed defense counsel was Charles Plowden, a tax commissioner campaigning for election to local political office. Plowden did not challenge the three police officers who testified that Stinney confessed to the two murders, despite this being the only evidence against him, and despite the prosecution's presentation of two different versions of Stinney's verbal confession. In one version Stinney was attacked by the girls after he tried to help one girl who had fallen in the ditch and he killed them in self defense. In the other version he had followed the girls, first attacking Mary Emma and then Betty June. There was no physical evidence linking him to the murders.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt; There is no written record of Stinney's confession apart from Deputy Newman's statement.&lt;ref name=collins /&gt; 

Stinney's trial had an [[all-white jury]]. More than 1,000 people crowded the courtroom but no blacks were allowed.&lt;ref name=collins /&gt; Other than the testimony of the three police officers, at trial prosecutors called three witnesses: Reverend Francis Batson, who discovered the bodies of the two girls, and the two doctors who performed the post-mortem examination. Conflicting confessions were reported to have been offered by the prosecution. The court allowed discussion of the &quot;possibility&quot; of rape despite an absence of evidence in the medical examiner's report. Stinney's counsel did not call any witnesses, did not cross-examine witnesses and offered little or no defense. Trial presentation lasted two and a half hours.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt; The jury took ten minutes to [[jury deliberation|deliberate]], after which they returned with a guilty verdict. The judge sentenced Stinney to death by the electric chair. There is no transcript of the trial. No appeal was filed.&lt;ref name=collins /&gt;

Stinney's family, churches and the [[NAACP]] appealed to Governor [[Olin D. Johnston]] for clemency, given the age of the boy. Others urged the governor to let the execution proceed, which he did.&lt;ref name=jones /&gt; Johnston stated in a response to one appeal for clemency that &quot;It may be interesting for you to know that Stinney killed the smaller girl to rape the larger one. Then he killed the larger girl and raped her dead body. Twenty minutes later he returned and attempted to rape her again, but her body was too cold. All of this he admitted himself.&quot; These assertions were not supported by the medical examiner's report.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt;

Between the time of Stinney's arrest and his execution, Stinney's parents were allowed to see him once, after the trial in the Columbia penitentiary.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt;

==Execution==
The execution of George Stinney was carried out at the [[Central Correctional Institution]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] on June 16, 1944, at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name= &quot;jones&quot;/&gt; Standing {{convert|5|feet|1|in|cm}} tall and weighing just over {{convert |90|lbs|kg |sigfig=1}},&lt;ref name=portraits&gt;{{cite serial |people=Karen Callahan (Producer) |date=June 30, 2004 |series=[[Day to Day]] |title=George Stinney, Youngest Executed |url=http://www.soundportraits.org/on-air/youngest_executed/ |place=Passaic, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stinney was so small compared to the usual adult prisoners that law officers had difficulty securing him to the frame holding the electrodes. The state's adult-sized face-mask did not fit him; as he was hit with the first 2,400 [[volt|V]] surge of electricity, the mask covering his face slipped off.&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Joy |date=2000 |title=States of Confinement: Policing, Detention and Prisons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tn_BF2ggwAUC |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=0-312-21777-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stinney was declared dead within four minutes of the initial electrocution. From the time of the murders until Stinney's execution, 83 days had passed.&lt;ref name=jones /&gt;

==Reopening of case==
In 2004, George Frierson, a local historian who grew up in Alcolu, started researching the case after reading a newspaper article about it. His work gained the attention of South Carolina lawyers Steve McKenzie and Matt Burgess.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt; In addition, Ray Brown, attorney James Moon, and others contributed countless hours of research and review of historical documents, in finding witnesses and evidence to assist in exonerating young Stinney. Among those who aided the case were the [[Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project]] (CRRJ) at [[Northeastern University School of Law]], who filed an ''amicus'' brief with the court in 2014.&lt;ref name=barbato&gt;{{cite web |last=Barbato |first=Lauren |date=December 17, 2014 |title=The Youngest Person Executed In America, George Stinney Jr., Almost Certainly Wasn't Guilty |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/54488-the-youngest-person-executed-in-america-george-stinney-jr-almost-certainly-wasnt-guilty |website=[[Bustle.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frierson and the ''pro bono'' lawyers first sought relief through the Pardon and Parole Board of South Carolina.

McKenzie and Burgess, along with lawyer Ray Chandler representing Stinney's family, filed a motion for a new trial on October 25, 2013.&lt;ref name=ebony&gt;{{cite news |last= Braswell | first= Kristin | title= Film to Explore George Stinney, Jr. Execution | url= http://www.ebony.com/news-views/film-to-explore-george-stinney-jr-execution-405 | date=February 28, 2014 | work= [[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131221/http://www.ebony.com/news-views/film-to-explore-george-stinney-jr-execution-405 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{quote|If we can get the case re-opened, we can go to the judge and say, 'There wasn't any reason to convict this child. There was no evidence to present to the jury. There was no transcript.

We hopefully have a witness that's going to say — that's non-family, non-relative witness — who is going to be able to tie all this in and say that they were basically an alibi witness. They were there with Mr. Stinney and this did not occur.&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{Cite news |last=Edwards |first=David |date=October 3, 2011 |url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/10/03/new-evidence-could-clear-14-year-old-executed-by-south-carolina/ |title=New evidence could clear 14-year-old executed by South Carolina |work=[[The Raw Story]] |archive-date=May 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530003313/http://www.rawstory.com/2011/10/new-evidence-could-clear-14-year-old-executed-by-south-carolina/ |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Frierson stated in interviews, &quot;there has been a person that has been named as being the culprit, who is now deceased. And it was said by the family that there was a deathbed confession.&quot; Frierson said that the rumored culprit came from a well-known, prominent white family. A member, or members, of that family had served on the initial coroner's inquest jury, which had recommended that Stinney be prosecuted.&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt;

In its ''amicus'' brief, the CRRJ said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is compelling evidence that George Stinney was innocent of the crimes for which he was executed in 1944. The prosecutor relied, almost exclusively, on one piece of evidence to obtain a conviction in this capital case: the unrecorded, unsigned “confession” of a 14-year-old child who was deprived of counsel and parental guidance, and whose defense lawyer shockingly failed to call exculpating witnesses or to preserve his right of appeal.&lt;ref name=barbato /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New evidence in the court hearing in January 2014 included testimony by Stinney's siblings that he was with them at the time of the murders. In addition, an affidavit was introduced from the &quot;Reverend Francis Batson, who found the girls and pulled them from the water-filled ditch. In his statement he recalls there was not much blood in or around the ditch, suggesting that they may have been killed elsewhere and moved.&quot;&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt; Wilford &quot;Johnny&quot; Hunter, who was in prison with Stinney, &quot;testified that the teenager told him he had been made to confess&quot; and always maintained his innocence.&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt;

Rather than approving a new trial, on December 17, 2014, [[circuit court]] Judge Carmen Mullen [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] Stinney's conviction. She ruled that he had not received a fair trial, as he was not effectively defended and his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right had been violated.&lt;ref name=mccloud/&gt;&lt;ref name=wis /&gt; The ruling was a rare use of the legal principle of ''[[coram nobis]]''. Judge Mullen ruled that his confession was likely coerced and thus [[Inadmissible Evidence|inadmissible]]. She also found that the execution of a 14-year-old constituted &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot;&lt;ref name=barbato /&gt; Mullen confined her judgment to the process of the prosecution, noting that Stinney &quot;may well have committed this crime.&quot; With reference to the legal process Mullen wrote &quot;No one can justify a 14-year-old child charged, tried, convicted and executed in some 80 days,&quot; concluding that &quot;In essence, not much was done for this child when his life lay in the balance.&quot;&lt;ref name=mcveigh /&gt; 

Family members of both Betty Binnicker and Mary Thames expressed disappointment at the ruling. They said that, although they acknowledge his execution at the age of 14 is controversial, they never doubted his guilt.

== Books and films about Stinney's case ==
[[David Stout]] based his first novel ''Carolina Skeletons'' (1988) on this case. He was awarded the 1989 [[Edgar Allan Poe Award|Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best First Novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/16/books/edgar-awards-for-mysteries.html | date=May 16, 1989| title= Edgar Awards for mysteries|page=C18 | publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=February 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stout suggests in the novel that Stinney, whom he renames Linus Bragg, was innocent. The plot revolves around a fictitious nephew of Stinney/Bragg, who unravels the truth about the case decades later. 

The novel was adapted as a 1991 television movie of the same name directed by John Erman, featuring [[Kenny Blank]] as Stinney/Bragg. [[Lou Gossett, Jr.]] played Stinney's/Bragg's younger brother James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= O'Connor |first= John J. |date=September 30, 1991 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/30/news/review-television-reopening-the-wounds-of-an-old-murder-case.html | title=Reopening the wounds of an old murder case |page= C16 | work=The New York Times| accessdate= February 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2014, another movie about the Stinney case, ''83 Days'', was planned by Pleroma Studios, written and produced by Ray Brown with [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]] as director.&lt;ref name=ebony /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brinson |first=Ron |date=January 24, 2014 |title=George Stinney trial is a reminder of justice not served |url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140124/PC1002/140129595 |newspaper= The Post and Courier |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603112156/http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140124/PC1002/140129595 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George W. Sams Jr.''' (born c.1946) was a member of the [[Black Panther Party]] convicted in the 1969 murder of New York Panther [[Alex Rackley]], which resulted in the [[New Haven Black Panther trials]] of 1970.

Sams turned [[state's evidence]] in return for a reduced charge of [[second-degree murder]]. He testified that, acting under direct orders from national party leader [[Bobby Seale]], he arranged for the kidnapping of Rackley to Panther headquarters in New Haven, where Rackley was tortured for two days then transported to the marshlands of [[Middlefield, Connecticut]], where he was shot by [[Warren Kimbro]] and [[Lonnie McLucas]] on Sams' orders. According to author [[Hugh Pearson (journalist)|Hugh Pearson]], who wrote the book ''[[The Shadow of the Panther: Huey Newton and the Price of Black Power in America]]'':
{{Quote|The Rackley case became one of the most controversial Panther cases of all, a prime example of the question of which illegal activities could be blamed on genuine party leaders, and which on agents-provocateurs or just plain deviants in the party. Seale was accused of ordering Rackley’s murder for being an alleged government agent, with the words, ‘Do away with him.’ Williams and others were accused of being present when Seale gave the command, George Sams accepting it, then he, Lonnie McLucas, and Warren Kimbro, the alleged triggermen, driving Rackley to a swamp to kill him. The case hinged largely on the questions of whether Seale actually did appear to give the command, and if so, how Seale’s command could be interpreted. The Panthers would insist that party member George Sams ordered the murder of Rackley on his own.}} Neither Kimbro nor McLucas corroborated Sams' testimony regarding Seale's involvement. The jury deadlocked on the charges against Seale and Black Panther leader [[Ericka Huggins]], and the charges against both were dropped. Members of the Black Panther party accused Sams of being an FBI informant.

[[File:George Ramsdale Witton-(1901).jpeg|thumb|300px|right|Lieutenant G.R. Witton, Bushveldt Carbineers (1901).]]
'''George Ramsdale Witton''' (1874–1942) was a Lieutenant in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in [[South Africa]].

He was temporarily sentenced to death for murder after the shooting of nine Boer prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Woolmore, pp. 142–144.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently reprieved by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], although Lieutenants [[Peter Handcock]] and [[Harry Morant|Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant]] who had been [[Court martial of Breaker Morant|court martialed]] with him were executed by a firing squad on 27 February 1902.

==Early life and involvement in the Boer War==
Witton was born near [[Warrnambool]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia, and was from a farming family; prior to his VIB enlistment, he was a gunner in the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. He enlisted in the [[Victorian Imperial Bushmen]] for the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], and was promoted from [[Corporal#Australia|Corporal]] to [[Squadron Quartermaster Sergeant#United Kingdom|Squadron Quartermaster-Sergeant]]. [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] Robert Lenehan enlisted him in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] with a commission as [[Lieutenant#Army ranks|Lieutenant]].

After the killing of a number of Boer prisoners, Witton was one of four officers charged by the [[British Army]] with murder, and was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19020404&amp;id=H-1hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ypEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6935,6526798&amp;hl=en Sidney Morning Herald April 4, 1902 Witton wrote he had fired at a escaping Boer to keep him away, although later in &quot;Scrapgoats of the Empire&quot; He admitted that he had shot a escaping Boer prisoner who had tried to seize Witton's carbine]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he strongly protested and secured a legal opinion from [[Isaac Isaacs]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]], an Australian member of parliament, who recommended that he should petition [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|HM the King]] for a pardon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/doview/nla.aus-vn311069-p.pdf Opinion of the Hon. Isaac A. Isaacs K.C., M.P., re the case of Lieutenant Witton] at nla.gov.au, accessed 21 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
Kitchener commuted Witton's sentence to life imprisonment. After further protests, he was released on 11 August 1904, although not pardoned. He had been ill twice in prison in England, once from [[arsenic]] fumes in a metal shop and once from [[typhoid fever]]. He returned to Australia on 12 November 1904 embittered after three years in prison and wrote a book giving his version of the events involving Morant, Handcock and the BVC.

==''Scapegoats of the Empire'' book and later life==
His book, ''Scapegoats of the Empire'' was originally published in 1907 by D. W. Paterson of [[Melbourne]], but was long unavailable. Prior to its reprint in 1982 by the Australian publishing house [[Angus &amp; Robertson]], it is claimed that only seven copies of the book survived in various Australian state libraries and in the possession of Witton's family. Although unsubstantiated, it has long been claimed that the book was suppressed by the Australian government and most copies were destroyed;{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} another explanation is that most of the copies were destroyed by an accidental fire at the publisher's warehouse. The 1982 reprinting was inspired by the success of a film based on the book, entitled [[Breaker Morant (film)|''Breaker Morant'']].

Witton's main assertion, as indicated by the book's provocative title, is that he, Morant, and Handcock were made [[scapegoat]]s by the British authorities in [[South Africa]] — that they were made to take the blame for widespread British [[war crime]]s against the Boers, and that the trial and executions were carried out by the British for political reasons, partly to cover up a controversial and secret &quot;no prisoners&quot; policy promulgated by [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and partly to appease the Boer government over the killing of Boer prisoners, in order to facilitate a peace treaty; the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed on 31 May 1902.

Witton also claims that many of the accusations about them, which led to their arrest and trial, were made by disaffected members of their regiment whose rebellious behaviour had been suppressed by Morant and Handcock.

An embittered Witton did not rush to enlist in [[World War I]]. After former and future [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Andrew Fisher]] pledged during the [[Australian federal election, 1914|1914 general election]] that Australia would defend Britain &quot;[[Andrew Fisher#Third government 1914–15|to the last man and last shilling]],&quot; Witton intimated that he would be that last man. He lived in [[Gippsland]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and in [[Queensland]] where he was a dairy farmer. He married twice, but did not have any children. He had a heart attack while cranking his car engine, and died in a hospital on 14 August 1942. He was buried&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.brisbane.qld.gov.au/cemeteries/cemeteries_step3.jsp?mapdisplay=43325 Witton George Ramsdale] — Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brisbane|Brisbane's]] [[Lutwyche Cemetery]] which, coincidentally, is located on the corner of Gympie and Kitchener Roads.

==2009 petitions for review of court martial ==
{{main|Pardon for Morant, Handcock and Witton}}
In 2009, an Australian lawyer and naval reservist, Commander Jim Unkles, submitted personal [[petition]]s, requesting a review of the convictions for Morant, Handcock and Witton, to the [[The Crown]], in the form of:
* [[Queen Elizabeth II]] personally, and;
* the Australian government, in the form of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Petitions Committee.
The petitions committee considered Unkles' petition on 15 March 2010. He appeared before it, along with others including historian Craig Wilcox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/commttee/R12891.pdf |title=Petition regarding the convictions of Morant, Handcock and Witton |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017072314/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/commttee/R12891.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee member [[Alex Hawke]] MHR stated: &quot;there is in my view serious and compelling evidence that some form of redress should be given, all these years later, to those men executed by the British&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Hansard'' &quot;House of Representatives Grievance Debate&quot;, 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The then [[Attorney-General of Australia]], [[Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McLelland]] referred the petition to the UK government.

On behalf of the Crown, Unkles' petition was rejected by UK [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Liam Fox]], in November 2010.

==New Jersey offenses==

===Murder conviction===
On November 23, 1962, Friday night, the day after Thanksgiving, George Wright, then 19 and from [[East Orange, New Jersey]], 
and three accomplices: Walter McGhee of Sylvan Avenue in [[Asbury Park]], Elizabeth Roswell (McGhee’s live-in girlfriend), and Julio DeLeon of Munroe Avenue in Asbury Park; were involved in the commission of multiple armed robberies.

The four suspects first robbed the Sands Motel in [[Englishtown, New Jersey|Englishtown]] of $200. They then made their way to 
the Collingswood Esso gasoline station on eastbound [[New Jersey Route 33|Route 33]] in [[Wall, New Jersey|Wall]].
At around 9:25 PM, during the second robbery, McGhee fatally wounded Walter Patterson, a 42-year-old [[World War II]] [[veteran]] and [[Bronze Star]] recipient who lived in [[Howell, New Jersey|Howell]]. 
Patterson was a father of two teenage daughters.
Patterson, who earlier that evening had relieved his brother Harry C. Patterson Jr. and sent him home to have dinner with his family, 
was taken to [[Abram Fitkin#Raleigh Fitkin-Paul Morgan Memorial Hospital.2C New Jersey .281930.29|Fitkin Memorial Hospital]] in [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune]], where he died from the gunshot wound two days later.

Wright, armed with a sawed-off [[.22]]-caliber rifle, and McGhee, armed with a [[.32 ACP|.32]]-caliber pistol, 
were both wearing women’s pantyhose over their faces when they assaulted Patterson.  
McGhee fired two shots during the robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Jason|title=Ambassador had no idea 41-year fugitive was escaped convict during encounters in Guinea-Bissau|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/ambassador_had_no_idea_41-year.html|publisher=The Star-Ledger|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Patterson was shot once in the abdomen before the four got away with $70 in cash. 
Police later determined it was a shot from McGhee’s pistol that led to Patterson’s death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster|first=Charles|title=Fugitive's arrest brings relief to N.J. family 49 years after killing|url=http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/C0/20111001/NJNEWS/310010034/|publisher=MyCentralJersey.com|accessdate=Oct 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four were arrested two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster|first=Charles|title=Wall gas station attendant killer captured in Portugal after 41-year manhunt|url=http://www.app.com/article/20110927/NJNEWS/309270050|publisher=Asbury Park Press|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On  December 13, 1962, Wright was indicted on state charges along with his associates.
McGhee, as the triggerman, was charged with Patterson’s murder and sentenced to a life prison term in February 1963, but was [[paroled]] in August 1977. 
Wright, as one of the holdup men, was also charged with murder.

On February 15, 1963, Wright reportedly changed his [[plea]] from ''[[Not guilty (plea)|Innocent]]'' 
to ''[[Nolo contendere|No Defense]]''  to the charge of murder,&lt;ref&gt;In a process similar 
to what is called ''[[Alford plea]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
in order to evade a jury trial that could have resulted in the death penalty. 
Wright was subsequently sentenced to 15 to 30 years’ [[incarceration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Fugitive Captured After More Than 40 Years|url=https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2011/international-fugitive-captured-after-more-than-40-years|publisher=FBI Newark|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escape from prison===
On August 19, 1970, between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., after serving over 7 years and 6 months of his sentence, Wright joined three inmates and &quot;just walked out&quot; between bed checks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fournier|first=Holly|title=Capture pulls Detroit hijacker from shadows|url=http://detnews.com/article/20111005/NATION/110050351/Capture-pulls-Detroit-hijacker-from-shadows|publisher=The Detroit News|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
from a state prison farm at Leesburg State Prison, now known as the [[Bayside State Prison]] in [[Leesburg, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US fugitive wants to serve time in Portugal|url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2011-09-30-Hijacker-Fugitive-Captured/id-6fb25d5c30034d00ae5122cbce5e3da1|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=Sep 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Wright escaped with his future hijacking accomplice, George Brown, who was serving a three to five-year sentence for a 1968 armed robbery conviction.
Allegedly they stole the prison warden’s car to get away.
They made their way to [[Detroit]], where they became affiliated with the [[Black Liberation Army]].

On August 26, 1970, federal complaints were issued in [[Atlantic City]], charging Brown and Wright with unlawful flight to avoid confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Escaped Murder Convict Among Skyjackers Of Jet|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2512&amp;dat=19720803&amp;id=RaNHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N_8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=944,299273|publisher=The Morning Record|date=Aug 3, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

boarded [[Delta Air Lines Flight 841]] in [[Detroit]]. 
The [[DC-8]] flight was bound for [[Miami]].

Wright was dressed allegedly as a priest and, using the alias the Rev. Larry Darnell Burgess, he smuggled a handgun aboard the flight in a hollowed-out Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/09/portugal-nabs-nj-killerhijacker-on-the-run-since-1970/1 Portugal nabs N.J. killer/hijacker on the run since 1970], Michael Winter, ''USA Today'', September 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
One passenger described the apparent ringleader as a black male, about 30, wearing a black mohair suit
which others described as a clerical outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hijackers Order Jet to Algeria|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iTxHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zSwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2636,8768&amp;hl=en|publisher=The Palm Beach Post|date=Aug 1, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pilot of the [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] Detroit-Miami flight, Captain William Harold May, then 41 and a 20-year Delta employee, said Wright was the group's leader.

The [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]], allegedly members of the [[Black Liberation Army]], seized the plane as it approached Miami, where they
demanded that FBI agents (dressed only in bathing suits) deliver $1 million ransom to the plane; the FBI complied.
The hijackers allowed the 86 hostage passengers to leave the plane in Miami, but kept the flight crew.  
They then ordered the plane to fly to [[Boston]], where they refueled and took on an international navigator. 
They then directed the plane to [[Algiers]], the capital of [[Algeria]], where they sought [[political asylum]] since that government had shown compassion towards those struggling for liberation.

May told reporters that two of the hijackers smoked marijuana continuously during the flight, and commented, “They said they were revolutionaries, that America is a decadent society and they didn’t want to live here anymore.”
Upon arrival in Algeria, Melvin McNair had parting words for his pilot: &quot;We're famous,&quot; he said, &quot;Send us a copy of your paper.&quot;

On Wednesday August 2, 1972, federal complaints of air piracy charges were filed in Miami, naming the five accomplices as defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hijackers Fled &quot;Decadent America&quot;|url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=115751502|publisher=Indiana Evening Gazette|date=Aug 3, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cleaver Urges Algeria To Allow Ransom Be Kept|url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/FreePdfViewer.aspx?img=50822025&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=3|publisher=Daily Messenger|date=Aug 3, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asylum in Algeria====
Wright and his associates were briefly taken into custody but were released after a few days. 
Reportedly, Wright and his group were taken in by the American writer and prominent Black Panther [[Eldridge Cleaver]], 
whom Algeria's sympathetic Socialist government allowed to open an office. 
Cleaver wrote an open letter to the then Algerian President, [[Houari Boumediene]], in part:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cleaver Calls on Algerian President To Keep Black Skyjackers' $1 Million|url=http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/underground_news/pdf/Jet_Articles_About_Party_6.pdf|date=Aug 7, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''In humbleness and all sincerity, I think it would be consistent with the Algerian tradition of struggle and revolution to continue welcoming American revolutionaries ... whether they come to your shores or your airfields, penniless or with millions of dollars. ...''

:''To carry out our struggle for the liberation of our people, we must have money. Without the money to finance and organize the struggle, there will be no freedom.''

This hijacking represented the final test of the Third World nation's commitment to supporting some contingents of the African American freedom movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meghelli|first=Samir|title=From the Algiers Motel to Algiers, Algeria: Black Power in Transnational Perspective, 1962–78|url=http://aha.confex.com/aha/2010/webprogram/Paper3791.html|publisher=Columbia University|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the request of the U.S. government, the Algerian government confiscated and returned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910394,00.html|title=Algeria: Panthers on Ice|publisher=Time Magazine |date= September 4, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; the $1 million in ransom money to the U.S. After the hijackers' calls to have the ransom money restored to them were ignored by the Algerian government, Wright and his associates disappeared.
Allegedly in early 1973, the group traveled by ship to France and lived and worked there with new identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heiser|first=Jürgen|title=Nach 41 Jahren in Portugal verhaftet: Der frühere Black-Panther-Aktivist George Wright kämpft gegen seine Auslieferung in die USA|url=http://www.ag-friedensforschung.de/regionen/USA/wright2.html|publisher=AG Friedensforschung|date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apprehension and refused extradition of accomplices====
On May 26, 1976, Wright’s four associates were located in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and arrested by the French National Police for carrying false
U.S. passports. 
Facing extradition to the United States, the four issued an appeal to the French people on October 11, 1976, claiming that while they were
“ready to face the consequences of our act,” they could not expect a fair trial in America and “would be condemned to spend the rest of our days in infernal prisons.”
French authorities declined the American extradition request in November 1976, holding the four defendants in the [[Fleury-Mérogis Prison|Fleury-Mérogis prison]], awaiting trial on hijacking charges.
On November 24, 1978, the ''Fleury 4'' were convicted by a French court for the hijacking. 
All received five-year sentences, but two years were suspended from the women's terms.
In the United States, they would have faced a minimum of 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=146174&amp;page=7|title=Persecution or Prosecution?|publisher=David Icke's Official Forums}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black Militants Get Prison Terms In Hijacking Case|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19781125&amp;id=IIYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rs0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2878,5736617|publisher=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=November 25, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury had found them guilty but noted &quot;extenuating circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19781125&amp;id=IIYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rs0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2878,5736617&lt;/ref&gt;
George Brown and Melvin McNair were released in 1981.

In 2012, a documentary titled ''Melvin &amp; Jean: An American Story''&lt;ref&gt;http://melvinandjean.com&lt;/ref&gt; was made by director Maia Wechsler.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1372421/ IMDB bio&lt;/ref&gt; 
Melvin McNair and his wife, Jean, work at an orphanage in the French town of [[Caen]], where reportedly they have turned their lives around completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Retired Triad pilot recalls 1972 hijacking of airliner|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2011/09/29/article/retired_triad_pilot_recalls_1972_hijacking_of_airliner|publisher=Associated Press|date=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McNair is known for coaching American baseball, teaching youth the art and strategy of the sport.

In 2010, a documentary titled ''Nobody Knows My Name''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1693798/ IMDB page&lt;/ref&gt; was made about the hijacking.
According to Mikhael Ganouna, producer of the film, Wright's hijacking accomplice, George Brown, lives in Paris but isn't worried 
about being extradited because he has already served his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US officials knew fugitive in Africa|url=http://topnews360.tmcnet.com/topics/associated-press/articles/2011/10/01/224548-ap-exclusive-us-officials-knew-fugitive-africa.htm|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extradition in a similar preluding hijacking====
The [[Delta Air Lines Flight 841|Flight 841]] hijacking was a [[copycat crime|copycat]] of a similar incident two months earlier, involving the hijacking of [[Western Airlines Flight 701]] from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Seattle]] on June 3, 1972 by [[Willie Roger Holder]], a black Vietnam veteran, and [[Catherine Marie Kerkow]], his white girlfriend. The hijackers claimed they had a bomb in an attache case and demanded $500,000. After allowing all 97 passengers to get off in San Francisco, they flew to Algeria where they were granted political asylum. The Algerian government confiscated and returned $488,000 of the ransom money to US officials.
On January 25, 1975, the two hijackers, carrying passports under the names Leavy Forte and Janice Ann Forte, were arrested on illegal entry charges by French police.
On April 15, 1975, a French court refused a US extradition request for the pair on grounds the hijacking was a political act.
In July 1986, French authorities moved to deport Holder to the US after he completed his sentence for 1984 assault charges.
Kerkow went missing, was never extradited, and her whereabouts and status remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hijack suspects seized in Paris|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19750127&amp;id=_EE0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=x-sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6839,3016098|publisher=The Miami News|date=Jan 27, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hijack Suspects Arrested|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TIZPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iQUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6061,4443636&amp;hl=en|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|date=Jan 26, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skyjacker Wants To Return Home|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1992&amp;dat=19770507&amp;id=4jdcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vFUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6100,832107|publisher=Merced Sun-Star|date=May 7, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France hands over suspect in 1972 hijacking|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19860727&amp;id=-xUpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QYQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2951,4392526|publisher=The Deseret News|date=Jul 27, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International fugitive captured==
After the [[arrest|apprehension]] of his four accomplices, Wright remained the lone hijacker at large. The elusive [[fugitive]] is known to have made his way to France, [[Guinea-Bissau]] (a former Portuguese colony) and finally to Portugal.
While living in Guinea-Bissau in the 1980s, Wright allegedly used his real name and worked as logistics manager of the Belgium-based nonprofit ''[http://www.ilesdepaix.org/ Iles de Paix]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fugitive hijacker George Wright 'socialised with US envoy in Africa'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/30/george-wright-socialised-us-envoy-africa?newsfeed=true|website=guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian|date=September 30, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US fugitive lived openly in Africa|url=http://topnews360.tmcnet.com/topics/associated-press/articles/2011/10/02/224610-ap-exclusive-us-fugitive-lived-openly-africa.htm|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apprehension===
On September 26, 2011, Wright was arrested in [[Mem Martins]], Portugal&lt;ref&gt;[https://maps.google.com/?ll=38.79385,-9.463393&amp;spn=0.000615,0.0012&amp;t=h&amp;z=20&amp;vpsrc=6%20%20Location%20of%20Wright's%20final%20capture%20in%20Portugal Location of Wright's final capture in Portugal]&lt;/ref&gt; after 41 years on the run, as the result of a combined task force that introduced cold-case evidence from [[New Jersey]]. The task force matched Wright's fingerprints from the New Jersey prison with the fingerprints on the [[Identity document|ID card]] issued by the Portuguese government. The United States sought his extradition, with the possibility that he will finish the remaining 22 years of his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/28/george-wright-hijacker-caught-portugal |title=George Wright, fugitive US hijacker, caught in Portugal after 40 years &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= September 28, 2011|accessdate=September 28, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15085289|title=US killer George Wright held in Portugal after 40 years|publisher=BBC News |date= September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the request was denied on the grounds that Wright is a Portuguese citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/nyregion/george-wright-fugitive-us-killer-avoids-extradition-from-portugal.html|title=Deadline Past, Portugal Says It Won't Send Killer to U.S. | first=James|last=Barron|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in Portugal===
Wright, who lived under the name of José Luís Jorge dos Santos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-28/fugitive-hijacker-arrested-portugal/50582770/1 |title=Longtime fugitive U.S. hijacker caught in Portugal |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=August 19, 1970 |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; had no known occupation, but allegedly at one point owned a [[BBQ]] chicken [[restaurant]], sold items at a stall along a popular tourist beach, worked as a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] at a local bar and, similar to Melvin McNair, coached youth in American basketball.  He married a Portuguese-English [[translator]] who was 13 years younger and, together, the couple had two children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">'''George Ronald York''' (February 6, 1943 – June 22, 1965) and '''James Douglas Latham''' (April 21, 1942 – June 22, 1965) were an American [[spree killer]] team who are the most recent individuals [[Capital punishment|executed]] by the U.S. state of [[Kansas]].

==Killing spree==
In late 1959, York and Latham met at [[Fort Hood]], [[Texas]], where both were [[private (rank)|privates]] in the [[United States Army]]. Latham had come to Fort Hood from [[Fort Carson, Colorado]], where he had undergone basic training between May and July 1959. In May 1961 York and Latham went [[AWOL]] and decided to travel to York's hometown of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]. On May 26, they encountered Edward J. Guidroz in [[Mix, Louisiana|Mix]], [[Louisiana]]. York and Latham badly beat him and stole his truck. On May 29, they met Althea Ottavio and Patricia Hewitt, visitors from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in Jacksonville. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, York and Latham strangled both women, stealing their money and dumping their car in a ditch.

On June 6, York and Latham attempted to rob a man in a Cadillac near [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]], [[South Carolina]], but the shots they fired at him missed and their would-be victim escaped. On June 7, York and Latham murdered John Whittaker in [[Tullahoma, Tennessee|Tullahoma]], [[Tennessee]]. They took Whittaker's car and abandoned the first truck they had stolen. On June 8 they abandoned Whittaker's car near [[Troy, Illinois|Troy]], [[Illinois]], and hitched a ride from a passerby named Albert Reed. They murdered Reed, dumped his body in a creek, and commandeered Reed's car. Several miles outside of [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]], Illinois, York and Latham killed gas station owner Martin Drenovac and stole gas and money from the station. York and Latham continued their cross-country killing spree in [[Wallace, Kansas|Wallace]], [[Kansas]], on June 9, where they robbed and killed 62-year-old Otto Ziegler; and near [[Craig, Colorado|Craig]], [[Colorado]], on June 10, they killed 18-year-old motel maid Rachel Moyer.

==Arrest and confession==
Later on June 10, 1961, York and Latham were arrested in [[Tooele County, Utah]] for violating the federal [[National Motor Vehicle Theft Act]], which prohibited transportation of a stolen vehicle across state lines within the United States. On June 11, York and Latham bragged to investigators that they had killed eight or nine people since they left Fort Hood. Police later learned that nine people were attacked by York and Latham, but two had survived. York and Latham claimed that being placed in a mixed-race unit in the army led to their desire to desert.

Execution loomed over the pair in a number of different states; had they been tried by [[Florida]], [[Illinois]] or [[Tennessee]], they would have most likely been [[electric chair|electrocuted]]. Had they been tried by [[Colorado]] or [[Missouri]], they would have most likely been [[gas chamber|gassed]]. Ultimately, they were tried by [[Kansas]], where hanging was the prescribed method of execution.

==Trial and imprisonment==
York and Latham were tried first in Kansas for the killing of Ziegler. They were convicted by a jury and sentenced to death on November 8, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IToRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YOkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6785,1275227&amp;dq= &quot;2 GI's Who Boasted Killing 7 To Hang for Killing One Man&quot;], ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]'', 1961-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; While on [[death row]] in Kansas, York and Latham associated with [[Richard Hickock]] and [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]], the subjects of [[Truman Capote]]'s book ''[[In Cold Blood]]''. York and Latham's crimes are described in Capote's book, and they are portrayed in the work as flippant, snide, and lacking any degree of remorse.

==Executions==
York and Latham were executed by [[hanging]] at [[Lansing Correctional Facility]] on June 22, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4k4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l1EEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4934,3399879&amp;dq=george+york+executed&amp;hl=en &quot;Killers executed in Kansas&quot;], ''[[The Dispatch (Lexington)|The Dispatch]]'', 1965-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o-VLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LosDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7480,7583185&amp;dq=george+york+mauriceville&amp;hl=en &quot;Killers Repent Before Execution&quot;], ''[[The Free Lance-Star]]'', 1965-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Since their execution, no one has been put to death by the state of Kansas, though a number of prisoners have been sentenced to death.

[[File:Georges Couthon by François Bonneville.png|thumb|Georges Auguste Couthon by Bonneville]]
[[File:Couthon signature, French politician during the French Revolution.jpg|thumb|Signature]]
'''Georges Auguste Couthon''' (22 December 1755 – 28 July 1794) was a French politician and lawyer known for his service as a deputy in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] during the [[French Revolution]]. Couthon was elected to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] on 30 May 1793 and served as a close associate of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] until his arrest and execution in 1794 during the period of the [[Reign of Terror]]. Couthon played an important role in the development of the [[Law of 22 Prairial]], which was responsible for a sharp increase in the number of executions of accused counter-revolutionaries.

== Background ==
Couthon was born on 22 December 1755 in [[Orcet]] in the province of [[Auvergne]]. His father was a notary, his mother the daughter of a shopkeeper. Couthon, like generations of his family before him, was a member of the lower bourgeoisie. Following in his father’s footsteps, Couthon became a notary. The skills he acquired enabled him to serve on the Provincial Assembly of Auvergne in 1787, his first experience of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Brunn, &quot;The Evolution of a Terrorist: Georges Auguste Couthon.&quot; ''The Journal of Modern History'' 2, no. 3 (September 1930): 410, {{JSTOR|1898818}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well-regarded by others as an honest, well-mannered individual.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''Twelve Who Ruled: The Year of the Terror in the French Revolution'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1941), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Revolution grew nearer, Couthon started to become disabled due to advancing paralysis in both legs. While doctors diagnosed Couthon with [[meningitis]] in 1792, Couthon blamed his paralysis on the frequent sexual experiences of his youth; although he began treating his condition with mineral baths, he grew so weak by 1793 that he was confined to a [[wheelchair]]&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Twelve Who Ruled'', 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; driven by hand cranks via gears.&lt;ref&gt;The wheelchair is still preserved in the [[Carnavalet Museum]].&lt;!-- The museum dates it c.1780; was he using it at times well before 1793, then? --&gt; See {{cite web|url=http://www.carnavalet.paris.fr/fr/collections/fauteuil-de-georges-couthon|title=Fauteuil de Georges Couthon|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political aspirations took him away from Orcet and to Paris, where he joined the [[Freemason]]s in 1790 in [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]]. While in Clermont, he became a fixture at its literary society, where he earned acclaim for his discussion on the topic of &quot;Patience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Twelve Who Ruled'', 13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, Couthon became one of the deputies of the Legislative Assembly, representing [[Puy-de-Dôme]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunn, &quot;The Evolution of a Terrorist,&quot; 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deputy ==
[[Image:Couthon1.png|thumb|left|Georges Auguste Couthon]] In 1791, Couthon traveled to Paris to fulfill his duty as a deputy in the Legislative Assembly. He then joined the growing [[Jacobin Club]] of Paris. He [[Left-wing politics#History of the term|chose to sit on the Left]] at the first meeting of the Assembly, but soon decided against associating himself with such radicals as he feared they were &quot;shocking the majority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bruun, “The Evolution of a Terrorist,” 416.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a very proficient speaker, and there is evidence that he exploited his condition as a [[paraplegic]] in order to gain the ear of the Assembly on issues he found important.&lt;ref&gt;Bruun, &quot;The Evolution of a Terrorist,&quot; 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1792, Couthon was elected to the [[National Convention]]. During a visit to [[Nord (département)|Flanders]], where he sought treatment for his health, he met and befriended [[Charles François Dumouriez]], later writing praises of him to the Assembly, referring to him as &quot;a man essential to us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brunn, &quot;The Evolution of a Terrorist,&quot; 420.&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with Dumouriez caused Couthon to consider joining the [[Girondist]] faction of the Assembly briefly, but after the Girondist electors of the Committee of the Constitution refused Couthon a seat on the Committee in October 1792, he ultimately committed himself to [[the Montagnards]] and the inner group formed around [[Maximilien Robespierre]] - a man with whom he shared many opinions, especially on religious issues such as revolutionary dechristianization (to which he was opposed- ''see [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Bruun, &quot;The Evolution of a Terrorist,&quot; 422-423.&lt;/ref&gt; Couthon became an enthusiastic supporter of the Montagnards and often echoed their opinions. At the [[Trial of Louis XVI]] in December 1792, he argued loudly against the Girondist request for a referendum. He would go on to vote for the [[death sentence]] without [[appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruun, &quot;The Evolution of a Terrorist,&quot; 427-428&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 1793, Couthon was elected to the [[Committee of Public Safety]], where he would work closely with Robespierre and Saint-Just in the planning of policy strategy and policing personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, ''The Longman Companion to the French Revolution'' (London: Longman Publishing Group, 1990), 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after rising to this position, Couthon was the first to demand the arrest of proscribed [[Girondist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;David Andress, ''The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005), 177&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lyon ==
Growing unrest had been occurring in [[Lyon]] in late February and early May. By 5 July 1793, the National Convention determined the city of Lyon to be “in a state of rebellion”, and by September, the Committee of Public Safety decided to send representatives to Lyon to end the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Longfellow, &quot;Silk Weavers and the Social Struggle in Lyon during the French Revolution, 1789-94,&quot; ''French Historical Studies'' 12, no. 1 (Spring, 1981): 22, {{JSTOR|286305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Couthon would be the representative that Lyon would surrender to on 9 October 1793. He was suspicious of the unrest in Lyon upon his arrival, and would not allow the [[Jacobins]] of the local administration to meet with one another, fearing an uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Longfellow, &quot;Silk Weavers,&quot; 23&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 1793, the Committee of Public Safety passed a decree that they believed would make an example of Lyon. The decree specified that the city itself was to be destroyed. Following the decree, Couthon established special courts that would supervise the demolition of the richest homes in Lyon, leaving the homes of the poor untouched.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 253-254.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the demolition of the city, the decree dictated that the rebels and the traitors were to be executed. Couthon had difficulty accepting the destruction of Lyon and proceeded slowly with his orders. Eventually, he would find that he could not stomach the task at hand, and by the end of October, he requested the National Convention to send a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, Paul. &quot;The Repression of Lyon 1793-4: Origins, Responsibility and Significance.&quot; French History, 1988: 74-101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[First French Republic|Republican]] atrocities in Lyon began after Couthon was replaced on 3 November 1793 by [[Jean Marie Collot d'Herbois]], who would go on to condemn 1,880 Lyonnais by April 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', 254&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law of 22 Prairial ==

Following his departure from Lyon, Couthon returned to Paris, and on 21 December, he was elected president of the Convention. He contributed to the prosecution of the [[Hébertists]] and continued serving on the Committee of Public Safety for the next several months. On 10 June 1794 (22 Prairial Year II on the [[French Republican Calendar]]), Couthon drafted the [[Law of 22 Prairial]] with the aid of Robespierre. On the pretext of shortening proceedings, the law deprived the accused of the aid of counsel and of witnesses for their defense in the case of trials before the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Law of 22 Prairial Year II (10 June 1794),&quot; George Mason University, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/439/ (23 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The Revolutionary Tribunals were charged with quick verdicts of innocence or death for the accused brought before them.

Couthon proposed the law without consulting the rest of the Committee of Public Safety, as both Couthon and Robespierre expected that the Committee would not be receptive to it.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention raised objections to the measure, but Couthon justified the measure by arguing that the political crimes oversaw by the Revolutionary Tribunals were considerably worse than common crimes because &quot;the existence of free society is threatened.&quot; Couthon also famously justified the deprivation of the right to a counsel by declaring that ''the guilty have no right for a counsel and the innocents do not need any''.&lt;ref&gt;''Les coupables n'y ont pas droit et les innocents n'en ont pas besoin'' cited from [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/cr-miqm/07-08/c0708006.asp Compte Rendu Mission d’information sur les questions mémorielles] of the French National Assembly.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robespierre assisted Couthon in his arguments by subtly implying that any member of the Convention who objected to the new bill should fear being exposed as a traitor to the republic.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama, ''Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1989), 836-837.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Couthon and Robespierre would be seen as dictators due to their vehement defense of the Law of 22 Prairial, and popular opinion would turn against them in the coming weeks.

The law passed, and the rate of executions promptly rose. In Paris alone, compared to an average of 5 executions that was the norm two months earlier (Germinal), 17 executions would take place daily during Prairial, with 26 occurring daily during the following month of Messidor.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, ''Citizens'', 837.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the passing of the Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794) and the end of July 1794, 1,515 executions took place at the [[Place de la Revolution]], more than half of the final total of 2,639 executions that occurred between March 1793 and August 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermidor ==

During the crisis preceding the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], Couthon showed considerable courage, giving up a journey to Auvergne in order, as he wrote, that he might either die or triumph with Robespierre and liberty. Robespierre had disappeared from the political arena for an entire month because of a supposed nervous breakdown, and therefore did not realize that the situation in the Convention had changed. His last speech seemed to indicate that another purge of the Convention was necessary, though he refused to name names. In a panic of self-preservation, the Convention called for the arrest of Robespierre and his affiliates, including Couthon, Saint-Just and Robespierre's own brother, [[Augustin Robespierre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Colin. The Longman Companion to the French Revolution. London: Longman Publishing Group, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Couthon was [[guillotine]]d on 10 [[Thermidor]] alongside Robespierre, although it took the executioner fifteen minutes (amidst Couthon's screams of pain) to arrange him on the board correctly due to his paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;Lenotre, G. Romances of the French Revolution. Translated by George Frederic William Lees. New York: William Heinemann: 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:David d'Angers - Couthon.jpg|thumb|Bust of Georges Couthon by [[David d'Angers]] (1844).]]
Couthon, during the course of the French Revolution, had transitioned from an undecided young deputy to a strongly committed law maker. Aside from his actions in Lyon, it is perhaps the creation of the Law of 22 Prairial, and the number of individuals who would be executed due to the law, that has become his lasting legacy. Following the acceptance of Couthon’s new decree, executions increased from 134 people in early 1794 to 1,376 people between the months of June and July in 1794. The Law of 22 Prairial also allowed tribunals to target noblemen and members of the clergy with reckless abandon, as the accused no longer could call character witnesses on their behalf. Of the victims executed during June and July 1794, 38 percent were of noble descent and 26 represented the clergy. More than half of the victims came from the wealthier parts of the bourgeoisie. Couthon's lawmaking not only greatly increased the rate of executions across France, but also brought the Terror away from mere counter-revolutionary acts and closer to social discrimination than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''The Oxford Dictionary of the French Revolution'', 275&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georges Jacques Danton''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔʁʒ dɑ̃tɔ̃|lang}}; 26 October 1759 – 5 April 1794) was a leading figure in the early stages of the [[French Revolution]], in particular as the first president of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. Danton's role in the onset of the Revolution has been disputed; many historians describe him as &quot;the chief force in the overthrow of the [[Ancien Régime|French monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[First French Republic]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028728/Georges-Danton|title=Georges Danton profile|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A moderating influence on the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], he was [[guillotine]]d by the advocates of [[revolutionary terror]] after accusations of [[venality]] and leniency toward the enemies of the Revolution.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

==Early life and the revolution==
{{moresources|section|date=February 2017}}
Danton was born in [[Arcis-sur-Aube]] in northeastern [[France]] to Jacques Danton and Mary Camus; a respectable, but not wealthy family. As a child, he was attacked by several animals, resulting in the disfigurement and scarring of the skin on his face, also contributed to by smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hibbert|first1=Christopher|title=The French Revolution|date=1980|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9780141927152|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining a good education he became an [[Advocate]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Hampson, Norman. ''Danton'' (New York: Basil Blackwell Inc., 1988), pp. 19–25.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He married Antoinette Gabrielle Charpentier (6 January 1760 – 10 February 1793) on 14 June 1787 at the church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois in Paris. The couple had three sons:

* François Georges, born on 2 February 1792, died on 18 June 1848.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Family tree Claude FORMA - Geneanet|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/domsyl?lang=en&amp;p=georges%2Bjacques&amp;n=danton&amp;oc=0|website=gw.geneanet.org|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February 1793, while Danton was on a mission in [[Belgium]], Charpentier died, aged 33, giving birth to a boy, who also did not survive. Danton was so affected by her death that he recruited sculptor [[Claude André Deseine]] and brought him by night to Sainte-Catherine cemetery to excavate Charpentier's body and execute a [[death mask]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Her bust is now on display at [[Troyes]] museum. After his first wife's death, Danton married Louise Sébastienne Gély, aged 16, daughter of Marc-Antoine Gély, court usher (huissier-audiencier) at the Parlement de Paris and member of the Club des Cordeliers. She looked after his two surviving sons.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Danton's first appearance in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] was as president of the [[Cordeliers]] club, whose name derives from the former [[convent]] of the Order of Cordeliers, where it held its meetings. One of many clubs important in the early phases of the Revolution, the Cordeliers was a centre for the &quot;popular principle&quot;, that France was to be a country of its people under [[popular sovereignty]]; they were the earliest to accuse the royal court of being irreconcilably hostile to freedom; and they most vehemently proclaimed the need for radical action.

In June 1791, the [[Louis XVI of France|King]] and the [[Marie Antoinette|Queen]] made [[Flight to Varennes|a disastrous attempt to flee]] from the capital. They were forced to return to the [[Tuileries Palace]], which effectively became their prison. Queen Marie Antoinette opened negotiations with the moderate leaders of the Revolution in an attempt to save the monarchy and to establish a moderate constitutional settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lord Acton |The French Revolution |1962|pp=165–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular reaction was intense, and those who favored a [[constitutional monarchy]], including [[Marquis de la Fayette|Lafayette]], became excited. A bloody dispersion of a popular gathering, known as the [[Champ de Mars Massacre|massacre of the Champ de Mars]] (July 1791), kindled resentment against the court and the constitutional party. Danton was, in part, behind the crowd that gathered, and fearing counter-revolutionary backlash, he fled to England for the rest of the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David. ''The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005), p. 51.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Constituent Assembly]] completed its work in September 1791. Due to the [[Self-denying Ordinance (French Revolution)|Self-denying Ordinance]]  none of its members were eligible to its successor, the short-lived [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]]. Danton's party was able to procure for him a subordinate post in the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]].

In April 1792, the [[Girondist]] government—still functioning as a constitutional monarchy—declared war against [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]. A country in turmoil from the immense civil and political changes of the past two years now faced war with an enemy on its eastern frontier. Parisian distrust for the court turned to open insurrection.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

On 10 August 1792, the popular forces [[10th of August (French Revolution)|marched on the Tuileries]]; the king and queen took refuge with the Legislative Assembly. Danton's role in this uprising is unclear. He  may have been one of its leaders; this view is supported because on the morning after the effective fall of the monarchy, Danton became minister of justice. This sudden rise from the subordinate office which he held in the commune is a demonstration of his power within the insurrectionist party.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Rise==
{{unsourced|section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Georges-Jacques Danton.jpg|thumb|According to a biographer, &quot;Danton's height was colossal, his make athletic, his features strongly marked, coarse, and displeasing; his voice shook the domes of the halls&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJIVGiq5w8sC&amp;pg=RA4-PA386&amp;dq=danton+height+looks|title=The Monthly Review|publisher=Printed for R. Griffiths|year=1814|accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the provisional executive government that was formed between the king's dethronement and the opening of the [[National Convention]] (the formal end of the monarchy), Danton found himself allied with [[Jean-Marie Roland]] and other members of the Girondist movement. Their strength was soon put to the test. The alarming successes of the Austrians and the surrender of two important fortresses caused panic in the capital; over a thousand prisoners were murdered. At that time, Danton was accused of directing these [[September Massacres]], but no evidence of this is available from modern research. However, he apparently did nothing to prevent the atrocities, and instead insisted that his colleagues should remain firm at their posts.

The election to the National Convention took place in September 1792; after which the remnant of the Legislative Assembly formally surrendered its authority. The Convention ruled France until October 1795. Danton was a member; resigning as Minister of Justice once it was clear that the invading Austrian and Prussian armies had been turned back, he took a prominent part in the deliberations and proceedings of the Convention.

In the Convention, according to the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition, &quot;He took his seat in the high and remote benches which gave the name of &quot;[[the Mountain]]&quot; to the revolutionists who sat there. He found himself side by side with [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]], whose exaggerations he never countenanced; with [[Maximilien Robespierre]], whom he did not regard very highly, but whose immediate aims were in many respects his own; with [[Camille Desmoulins]] and [[Pierre Philippeaux]], who were his close friends and constant partisans.&quot; As for his foes, the Girondists, they were &quot;eloquent, dazzling, patriotic, but unable to apprehend the fearful nature of the crisis, too full of vanity and exclusive party-spirit, and too fastidious to strike hands with the vigorous and stormy Danton.&quot; Dreading the people who had elected Danton, and holding Danton responsible for the September Massacres, they failed to see that his sympathy with the vehemence and energy of the streets positioned him uniquely to harness on behalf of the defense of France that insurrectionary spirit that had removed the monarchy. Danton saw radical Paris as the only force to which the National Convention could look in resisting Austria and its allies on the north-east frontier, and the reactionaries in the interior. &quot;Paris,&quot; he said, &quot;is the natural and constituted centre of free France. It is the centre of light. When Paris shall perish there will no longer be a [[republic]].&quot;

Danton voted for the death of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in January 1793. After the execution had been carried out, he thundered &quot;The kings of Europe would dare challenge us? We throw them the head of a king!&quot; Danton had a conspicuous share in the creation of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], which on the one hand took the weapons away from the disorderly popular vengeance of the September Massacres, but which would become the instrument of the institutionalized [[Reign of Terror|Terror]]. When all executive power was conferred upon a [[Committee of Public Safety]] (6 April 1793), Danton had been one of the nine original members of that body. He was dispatched on frequent missions from the Convention to the republican armies in [[Belgium]], and wherever he went he infused new energy into the army. He pressed forward the new national system of [[education]], and he was one of the legislative committee charged with the construction of a new system of government. He tried and failed to bridge the hostilities between Girondists and [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]]. The Girondists were irreconcilable, and the fury of their attacks on Danton and [[the Mountain]] was unremitting.

==Fall of the Girondists==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
Although he was—again in the words of the 1911 ''Britannica''—&quot;far too robust in character to lose himself in merely personal enmities&quot;, by the middle of May 1793 Danton had made up his mind that the [[Girondists]] must be politically suppressed. The Convention was wasting time and force in vindictive factional recriminations, while the country was in crisis. [[Charles François Dumouriez]], the senior commander of the Battles of [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] and [[Battle of Jemappes|Jemappes]], had deserted. Danton had defended Dumouriez against attacks in Convention, probably to allow Dumouriez to concentrate on the war, before the General's defection, so it undermined Danton's own position. The French armies were suffering a series of checks and reverses. A royalist rebellion was gaining formidable dimensions in the west. The Girondists were clamoring for the heads of Danton and his colleagues in the Mountain, but they would lose this struggle to the death.

[[Image:DantonSpeaking.jpg|thumb|Danton addressing the [[National Convention]].]]
There is no positive evidence that Danton directly instigated the [[insurrection of 31 May — 2 June]] 1793, which ended in the purge of the Convention and the [[Girondist#Girondists and the Terror|proscription of the Girondists]]. He afterwards spoke of himself as in some sense the author of this revolution, because a little while before, stung by some trait of factious perversity in the Girondists, he had openly cried out in the midst of the Convention, that if he could only find a hundred men, they would resist the oppressive authority of the Girondist [[Commission of Twelve]]. At any rate, he certainly acquiesced in the violence of the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|commune]], and he publicly gloried in the expulsion of the men who stood obstinately in the way of a vigorous and concentrated exertion of national power.

Danton, unlike the Girondists, &quot;accepted the fury of popular passion as an inevitable incident in the work of deliverance.&quot; (1911 ''Britannica'') He was not an enthusiast of the [[Reign of Terror]] like [[Billaud-Varenne]] or [[Jacques René Hébert]]; he saw it as a two-edged weapon to be used as little as necessary. The authors of the 1911 ''Britannica'' see him at this time as wishing &quot;to reconcile France with herself; to restore a society that, while emancipated and renewed in every part, should yet be stable; and above all to secure the independence of his country, both by a resolute defence against the invader, and by such a mixture of vigour with humanity as should reconcile the offended opinion of the rest of Europe.&quot;

The position of the Mountain had completely changed. In the Constituent Assembly its members had been a mere 30 out of the 578 of the [[Estates-General of 1789|third estate]]. In the Legislative Assembly they had not been numerous, and none of their chiefs held a seat. In the first nine months of the Convention they were struggling for their very lives against the Girondists. In June 1793, for the first time, they found themselves in possession of absolute power. Men who had for many months been &quot;nourished on the ideas and stirred to the methods of opposition&quot; [1911 ''Britannica''] suddenly had the responsibility of government. Actual power was in the hands of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and the [[Committee of General Security]]. Both were chosen out of the body of the Convention. The drama of the nine months between the expulsion of the Girondins and the execution of Danton turns upon the struggle of the committees (especially the former, which would gain ascendancy) to retain power: first, against the insurrectionary municipal government of Paris, the ''commune''; and second, against the Convention, from which the committees derived an authority that was regularly renewed on the expiry of each short term.

Danton, immediately after the fall of the Girondins, had thrown himself with extraordinary energy into the work to be done. He was prominent in the task of setting up a strong central authority, taming the anarchical ferment of Paris. It was he who proposed that the Committee of Public Safety be granted [[dictator]]ial powers, and that it should have copious funds at its disposal. He was not a member of the resulting committee: in order to keep himself clear of any personal suspicion, he announced his resolution not to belong to the body which he had thus done his best to make supreme in the state and left it in July 1793. His position during the autumn of 1793 was that of a powerful supporter and inspirer from outside the government which he had been foremost in setting up.

==Reign of Terror==
The [[French National Convention]] during the autumn of 1793 began to assert its authority further throughout France, creating the bloodiest period of the French Revolution in which some historians assert approximately 40,000 people were killed in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=Donald|title=The Incidence of the Terror During the French Revolution: A Statistical Interpretation|year=1935|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-8446-1211-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (At least a further 200.000 people perished in the civil war resulting from the provincial revolts, such as the [[War in the Vendée]], coming as a reaction to the revolutionary government.) Following the fall of the [[Girondins]], a group known as the [[Indulgents]] would emerge from amongst the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] as the legislative right within the Convention and Danton as their most vocal leader. Having long supported the progressive acts of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], Danton would begin to propose that the Committee retract legislation instituting terror as “the order of the day.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French National Convention|title=Terror is the Order of the Day|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/416/|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Committee of Public Safety was concerned with strengthening the centralist policies of the Convention and its own grip over that body, Danton was in the process of devising a plan that would effectively move popular sentiment among delegates towards a more moderate stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andress|first=David|title=The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France|year=2005|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-53073-0|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant adopting values popular among the [[sans-culotte]], notably the control of bread prices that had seen drastic increase with the famine that was being experienced throughout France. Danton also proposed that the Convention begin taking actions towards peace with foreign powers, as the Committee had declared war on the majority of European powers, such as England, Spain, and Portugal.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The [[Reign of Terror]] was not a policy that could be easily transformed. Indeed, it would eventually end with the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] (July 1794), when the Convention rose against the Committee, executed its leaders, and placed power in the hands of new men with a new policy. But in ''[[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|Germinal]]''—that is, in March 1794—feeling was not ripe. The committees were still too strong to be overthrown, and Danton, heedless, instead of striking with vigor in the Convention, waited to be struck. &quot;In these later days,&quot; writes the 1911 ''Britannica'', &quot;a certain discouragement seems to have come over his spirit&quot;. His wife had died during his absence on one of his expeditions to the armies; he had her body exhumed so as to see her again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.H.|last=Beesly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwzdA9vq0v8C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=danton+exhumed|title=Life of Danton|page=172|isbn=978-1-4179-5724-8|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2005|accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite genuine grief, Danton quickly married again, and, the Britannica continues, &quot;the rumour went that he was allowing domestic happiness to tempt him from the keen incessant vigilance proper to the politician in such a crisis.&quot;{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Ultimately, Danton himself would become a victim of the Terror. As he attempted to shift the direction of the revolution, by collaborating with [[Camille Desmoulins]] through the production of ''[[Le Vieux Cordelier]]'' a newspaper that called for the end of the official Terror and dechristianization, as well as launching new peace overtures to France's enemies, those who most closely associated themselves with the Committee of Public Safety, among them key figures such as [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and [[Georges Couthon]], would search for any reason to indict Danton for counter-revolutionary activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andress|first=David|title=The Terror: The Merciless Fight for Freedom in Revolutionary France|year=2005|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-53073-0|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These actions would lead to an investigation of Danton’s revolutionary vigor, and in the end he would be tried and executed for his shady dealings with foreign countries in the interest of filling his own pockets.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Financial corruption and accusations==
[[Image:FR-65440 statdanton01.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Danton in [[Tarbes]].]]

Toward the end of the Reign of Terror, Danton was accused of various financial misdeeds, as well as using his position within the Revolution for personal gain. Many of his contemporaries commented on Danton's financial success during the Revolution, certain acquisitions of money that he could not adequately explain.&lt;ref&gt;Hampson, Norman, ''The Life and Opinions of Maximilien Robespierre'' (London: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co., 1974), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the specific accusations directed against him were based on insubstantial or ambiguous evidence.

Between 1791-93, Danton faced many allegations, including taking bribes during the insurrection of August 1792, helping his secretaries to line their pockets, and forging assignats during his mission to Belgium.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1974&quot;&gt;Hampson, Norman, ''The Life and Opinions of Maximilien Robespierre'' (London: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co., 1974), p. 204.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most compelling evidence of financial corruption was a letter from Mirabeau to Danton in March 1791 that casually referred to 30,000 livres that Danton had received in payment.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1974&quot;/&gt;

During his tenure on the Committee of Public Safety, Danton organized a peace treaty agreement with Sweden. Although the Swedish government never ratified the treaty, on 28 June 1793 the convention voted to pay 4 million livres to the Swedish Regent for diplomatic negotiations. According to [[Bertrand Barère]], a journalist and member of the Convention, Danton had taken a portion of this money which was intended for the Swedish Regent.&lt;ref&gt;Hampson, Norman, ''Danton'' (New York: Basil Blackwell Inc., 1988), 121&lt;/ref&gt; Barère’s accusation was never supported by any form of evidence.

The most serious accusation, which haunted him during his arrest and formed a chief ground for his execution, was his alleged involvement with a scheme to appropriate the wealth of the [[French East India Company]]. During the reign of the Old Regime the original French East India Company went bankrupt. It was later revived in 1785, backed by royal patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Scurr, Ruth, ''Fatal Purity: Robespierre and the French Revolution'' (New York, NY: Holt Paperbacks, 2006), 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The Company eventually fell under the notice of the National Convention for profiteering during the war. The Company was soon liquidated while certain members of the Convention tried to push through a decree that would cause the share prices to rise before the liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;Scurr, Ruth,'' Fatal Purity: Robespierre and the French Revolution'' (New York, NY: Holt Paperbacks, 2006), 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Discovery of the profits from this insider trading led to the blackmailing of the directors of the Company to turn over half a million livres to known associates of Danton.&lt;ref&gt;Andress, David, ''The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005), 252.&lt;/ref&gt; While there was no hard evidence that Danton was involved, he was vigorously denounced by [[François Chabot]], and implicated by the fact that [[Fabre d’Eglantine]], a member of the Dantonists, was implicated in the scandal. Danton continued to defend Fabre d'Eglantine even after the latter had been exposed and arrested.

==Arrest, trial, and execution==
On 30 March 1794, Danton, Desmoulins and others of the ''indulgent'' party were suddenly arrested. Danton displayed such vehemence before the revolutionary tribunal that his enemies feared he would gain the crowd's favour. The Convention, in one of its &quot;worst fits of cowardice&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;1911 ''Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; assented to a proposal made by [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] during the trial that, if a prisoner showed want of respect for justice, the tribunal might exclude the prisoner from further proceeding and pronounce sentence without him being present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Schama|title=Citizens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danton, Desmoulins, and many other actual or accused Dantonist associates were tried from 3-5 April before the Revolutionary Tribunal. The trial was less criminal in nature than political, and as such unfolded in an irregular fashion. The jury had only seven members, despite the law demanding twelve, as it was deemed that only seven jurors could be relied on returning the required verdict. Danton made lengthy and violent attacks on the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and the accused demanded the right to have witnesses appear on their behalf; they submitted requests for several, including, in Desmoulins' case, Robespierre.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} 

The Court's President, [[Martial Joseph Armand Herman|M.J.A. Herman]], was unable to control the proceedings until the aforementioned decree was passed by the National Convention, preventing the accused from further defending themselves. These facts, together with confusing and often incidental denunciations (for instance, a report that Danton, while engaged in political work in Brussels, had appropriated a carriage filled with several hundred thousand pounds of table linen)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Claretie|first=Jules|title=Camille Desmoulins and his wife|year=1876|publisher=Smith, Elder &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=313|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVsDAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Camille+Desmoulins+and+his+wife&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZEkKmtNKHV&amp;sig=62ryT3HVYJXRYWbGl2mplF9xVK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TR96UIzlCef50gGMmYA4&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Camille%20Desmoulins%20and%20his%20wife&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and threats made by prosecutor [[Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville]] towards members of the jury, ensured a guilty verdict. 
Danton and the rest of the defendants were condemned to death, and at once led, in company with fourteen others, including [[Camille Desmoulins]] and several other members of the [[Indulgents]], to the guillotine. &quot;I leave it all in a frightful welter,&quot; he said; &quot;not a man of them has an idea of government. Robespierre will follow me; he is dragged down by me. Ah, better be a poor fisherman than meddle with the government of men!&quot; The phrase 'a poor fisherman' was almost certainly a reference to Saint Peter, Danton having reconciled to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrol, Warren, ''The Guillotine and the Cross'' (Front Royal, Christendom Press, 1991)&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the group of fifteen who were guillotined together on 5 April 1794, including Marie Jean Hérault de Séchelles, Philippe Fabre d'Églantine and Pierre Philippeaux, Desmoulins died third, and Danton last.&lt;ref&gt;[[Camille Desmoulins#Trial and execution]]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1911 ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' wrote that Danton stands out as a master of commanding phrase. One of his fierce sayings has become a proverb. Against [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|the Duke of Brunswick]] and the invaders, &quot;''il nous faut de l'audace, et encore de l'audace, et toujours de l'audace''&quot;—&quot;We need audacity, and yet more audacity, and always audacity!&quot;{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Character disputes==
His influence and character during the [[French Revolution]] was, and still is, widely disputed among many historians, with the stretch of perspectives on him ranging from corrupt and violent to generous and patriotic.&lt;ref&gt;Hampson, Norman, ''Danton'' (New York: Basil Blackwell), pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Danton did not leave very much in the way of written works, personal or political, and, most information about his actions and personality has thus been derived from secondhand sources.&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Montague, reviewer of ''Discours de Danton'' by André Fribourg, ''The English Historical Review'' 26, No. 102 (1911), 396. {{JSTOR|550513}}.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One view of Danton, presented by the historians [[Thiers]] and [[Mignet]],&lt;ref&gt;Legrand, Jacques. ''Chronicle of the French Revolution 1788–1799,'' London: Longman, 1989.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was that he was &quot;a gigantic revolutionary&quot; with extravagant passions, a high level of intelligence, and a tolerance of violence for his goals. Another perspective of Danton emerges from the work of [[Lamartine]], who called Danton a man &quot;devoid of honor, principles, and morality&quot; who found only excitement and a chance for distinction during the French Revolution. He was merely &quot;a statesman of materialism&quot; who was bought anew every day. Any revolutionary moments were staged for the prospect of glory and more wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Furet, François. ''La révolution en debat,'' Paris: Gallimard, 1999.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view of Danton is presented by Robinet, whose examination of Danton is more positive and portrays him as a figure worthy of admiration. According to Robinet, Danton was a committed, loving, generous citizen, son, father, and husband. He remained loyal to his friends and the country of France by avoiding &quot;personal ambition&quot; and gave himself wholly to the cause of keeping &quot;the government consolidated&quot; for the Republic. He always had a love for his country and the laboring masses, who he felt deserved &quot;dignity, consolation, and happiness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Béraud, ''Twelve Portraits of the French Revolution,'' (Freeport, NY: Books for Libraries Press, 1968).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

*In his novel ''Locus Solus'', [[Raymond Roussel]] tells a story in which Danton makes an arrangement with his executioner for his head to be smuggled into his friend's possession after his execution.  The nerves and musculature of the head ultimately end up on display in the private collection of Martial Canterel, reanimated by special electrical currents and showing a deeply entrenched disposition toward oratory.

'''Georges &quot;Jo&quot; Querelle''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔʁʒ kəʁɛl}}) is the [[protagonist]] and [[antihero]] of [[Jean Genet]]'s 1947 novel ''[[Querelle de Brest]]''.

==Character overview==
A sailor on the cargo ship ''Le Vengeur'', Querelle is also a thief, a [[prostitute]], an [[opium]] [[smuggling|smuggler]], and a [[serial killer]]. While he ostensibly kills for money, his real motive for [[murder]] is the sheer, liberating pleasure he experiences from it; he kills to feel alive.

===Sexuality===
While most of Querelle's sexual partners are men, he is more aroused by power than by people. Genet writes that Querelle views sex as an act of either domination or submission, and so treats his partners as objects that exist for the sole purpose of enacting his [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] of power and punishment. He has at least a passing interest in women; in one of the novel's main conflicts, he competes with his brother, Robert, for Madame Lysiane, Robert's mistress and the proprietess of a [[brothel]] they both frequent. Even then, however, Querelle's pursuit of her is completely self-serving, a ploy to get the best of his brother.

His mysterious, brooding persona and sexual ambiguity make him an object of fascination and attraction to everyone in his orbit, especially Madame Lysiane and Lieutenant Seblon, his [[closeted]] superior officer. While not completely understanding who or what he is, the people in his life find themselves inescapably drawn to him, often at their own peril.

==In the novel==
He runs his smuggling racket out of ''Le Vengeur'', enlisting one of his shipmates, Vic, as his accomplice. One night, when the ship is docked in the [[France|French]] port town of [[Brest, France|Brest]], Querelle slits Vic's throat. The ship is delayed at the port as the police investigate, led by Mario, a predatory police captain who [[extortion|extorts]] sexual favors from the men he investigates before putting them in jail.

Desperate for a scapegoat, Querelle befriends Gilbert &quot;Gil&quot; Turko, a young man fleeing arrest for the murder of a man who propositioned him, with the intention of framing him for Vic's murder. Much to his surprise, however, he finds in Gil a kindred spirit whom he wants to &quot;teach,&quot; both sexually and in the &quot;art&quot; of murder. He enlists Gil to help in [[robbery|mugging]] Seblon, confident that the lieutenant's infatuation with him will prevent him from going to the police.

Querelle sleeps with Mario in an attempt to get him to back away from arresting him or Gil, but the captain is unmoved from turning him into yet another of his jailed conquests. Seeing no alternative, Querelle betrays Gil to Mario, adding to Gil's already dire situation the blame for a murder he didn't commit.

At the end of the novel, Querelle seduces Seblon, only to turn him over to the police the next day. He leaves Brest the same day when ''Le Vengeur'' sets sail.

==Portrayals in other media==
Querelle was portrayed by [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] in [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s 1982 [[Querelle|film adaptation]] of the novel.

'''Georges Henri Yvon Joseph Ruggiu''' (born October 12, 1957 in [[Verviers]], [[Belgium]]) was a presenter on the Rwandan radio station [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]], which played a significant role in promoting the [[Rwandan Genocide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TW&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the station's [[RTLM#Individuals associated with the station|other broadcasters]], Ruggiu incited violence against [[Tutsi]] and moderate [[Hutu]] over the air. Ruggiu eventually pleaded guilty to charges of incitement to commit genocide and in 2000 was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]].  An Italian-Belgian who became involved in Rwandan politics two years before the genocide, Ruggiu was the only non-Rwandan charged with involvement in the genocide.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-voice-of-terror-716004.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=The voice of terror | date=2000-05-30 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-2008-03-01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2&quot; /&gt;

==Life in Belgium==
Ruggiu's mother was a Belgian teacher, his father an Italian fireman.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot; /&gt;  Until the age of 35 he lived at home&lt;ref name=&quot;guard&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/02/ewenmacaskill.ianblack | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Broadcaster jailed for inciting genocide | first=Ian | last=Black | date=2000-06-02 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked in [[Verviers]], first as &quot;a counsellor for young drug addicts and then as a teacher for mentally handicapped children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot; /&gt;  In 1992 he moved to the city of [[Liège (city)|Liège]], commuting to Brussels to work in a social security office.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot; /&gt;  In Liège he &quot;befriended a Rwandan Hutu, was drawn into the Rwandan expatriate community and was soon seen in the company of Rwandan diplomats and officials of President [[Juvenal Habyarimana]]'s, party, the [[MRND]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guard&quot; /&gt;  He began visiting Rwanda&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot; /&gt; and moved there in 1993.

==Participation in genocide==
From January to July 1994, prior to and during the genocide, Ruggiu worked in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]] as a journalist and producer for [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLM).  Ruggiu had no experience in journalism and did not speak [[Kinyarwanda]].&lt;ref name=independent /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;echoes&quot;&gt;http://www.idrc.ca/rwandagenocide/ev-108188-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html&lt;/ref&gt;  RTLM was one of the chief sources of extremist [[Hutu]] propaganda, broadcasting twenty-four hours a day and openly exhorting its audience to kill [[Tutsi]]s and &quot;disloyal&quot; Hutus.  Ruggiu personally wrote and broadcast much content of this nature, relentlessly egging on his listeners that the &quot;graves were waiting to be filled&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot; /&gt; Ruggiu personally broadcast programs inciting Hutus to commit murder or serious attacks against Tutsi rebels, whom he called &quot;cockroaches&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;R2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.cpj.org/attacks00/africa00/Rwanda.html
  | accessdate = 2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also encouraged persecution of these Tutsi, and moderate Hutu and [[Belgium|Belgian]] citizens in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;TW&quot;/&gt; Airtime filled by Ruggiu accounted for approximately 8% of RTLM's broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Allan (Ed.) |authorlink= |title=Kimani, Mary: RTLM: the Medium that Became a Tool for Mass Murder.

Although some of his defenders have suggested that Ruggiu did not know exactly what was going on around him in Rwanda, this opinion is sharply disputed by Rwandan Genocide scholar [[Alison des Forges]]: &quot;It is beyond belief that Ruggiu did not know [what was going on]... The tone of Mille Collines became more and more violent and witnesses say Ruggiu was living at the army barracks in Kigali and eating in the mess. He was hanging out with those that did the killing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot; /&gt;

==Capture, trial, and sentencing==
After the genocide Ruggiu fled to refugee camps in [[Zaire]] and [[Tanzania]] and then to [[Kenya]], where he converted to [[Islam]] and adopted the name Omar.  He &quot;joined a Somali Muslim community in Mombasa&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot; /&gt; and was &quot;on the verge of fleeing to Iraq&quot; when he was arrested by Kenyan police in 1997.&lt;ref name=guard /&gt;

On July 23, 1997, Ruggiu was arrested in [[Mombasa]] at the request of the prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], and moved to the site of the tribunal in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TW&quot;/&gt; Ruggiu was charged with &quot;direct and public incitement to commit genocide&quot; and &quot;crimes against humanity (persecution)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Georges Rutaganda''' (November 27, 1958 &amp;ndash; October 11, 2010) was the vice president of the [[Rwanda]]n [[Hutu]] militia ''[[Interahamwe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/georges-anderson-nderubumwe_rutaganda_202.html |title=Georges Anderson Nderubumwe Rutaganda |publisher=Trial Watch }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rutaganda was partly responsible for the [[Rwandan Genocide]] of 1994. Prosecutor James Stewart stated, &quot;Without Georges Rutaganda, the Rwandan genocide would not have functioned the way it did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/552441.stm|title=Life sentence for Rwanda genocide leader|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=1999-12-06|accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on radio RTLM ([[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]]) in [[Kigali]] in 1994, encouraging Interahamwe Militia to exterminate all Tutsis. It was alleged that Rutaganda captured, raped, and tortured Tutsi women in the Interahamwe Hideouts in Kigali. Other accounts state that Rutaganda captured Tutsi prostitutes believing them to be [[witch]]es. 

During this time, Rutaganda was reported to supply his militia with stolen supplies from the [[Military of Rwanda|Rwandan military]]. Rutaganda was arrested on October 10, 1995, and transferred to [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], on May 26, 1996. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[murder]].

He died in prison in [[Benin]] on October 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20101013-ancien-chef-milicien-rwandais-georges-rutaganda-est-decede-benin&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Rutaganda was portrayed by [[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]] in the historical drama film ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0006543/|title=George Rutaganda (Character) |publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georgios Mavromichalis''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Μαυρομιχάλης}}; 1800&amp;ndash;1831) was son of the great Maniot primate [[Petros Mavromichalis]].

When his father was captured, placed in prison and charged with [[high treason]] on the order of Governor of Greece [[John Capodistria]], Georgios and his uncle [[Kostantinos Mavromichalis]] decided to take revenge. On 9 October 1831, the duo decided to assassinate the Governor as he entered St Spyridon church in [[Nauplio]]. Konstadinos firstly attempted to shoot Capodistrias, but he missed, which led him to stabbing him in the stomach and Georgios stabbed the president through the heart. As they were escaping Konstantinos was shot.  Georgios managed to escape and hide in the French Embassy; after a few days he surrendered to the Greek authorities. He was sentenced to death by a court-martial and was executed by [[firing squad]].

'''Geppetto''' is a major character, albeit one that's rarely seen, in the [[comic book]] series ''[[Fables (comic)|Fables]]'', written by [[Bill Willingham]] and published by [[DC Comics]] as part of the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].

His actions are responsible for the entire premise of the comic book, in that he is the being known as '''The Adversary''' who masterminded the conquest of the Fable homelands, forcing the Fables to flee into the mundane world. During the war against the Empire, he was the primary antagonist of the series before being given amnesty, having his role replaced by Mister Dark.

==Fictional character biography==

===Beginning===
Based on the character of [[Mister Geppetto]] from the book ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', Geppetto is the creator of [[Pinocchio (Fables)|Pinocchio]], the wooden boy who was ultimately, after a series of adventures, turned into a human boy by the [[Blue Fairy]]. However, it transpired that his conversion to human form had not cured Pinocchio of his wanderlust and the boy repeatedly left on adventures, often disappearing for years at a time, leaving Geppetto behind to wait in lonely solitude for his return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = George  | first = Richard  | title = Exclusive Fables Interview Complete Edition, pt. 1  | publisher = IGN  | date = 2007-01-05  | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/753/753361p1.html  | accessdate = 2008-10-11|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229141221/http%3A//comics.ign.com/articles/753/753361p1.html |archivedate = December 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geppetto's solution seemed obvious, to create new children, initially older sons, operating under the assumption that they would prove more mature than Pinocchio, then turning his hand to daughters.   The Blue Fairy continued to visit, and, every now and then, would take a liking to one of the children and turn them human.  Having also been hurt by Pinocchio's vagabond nature, she altered her magic to include bonds of loyalty to Geppetto and of fealty to hearth and home.

===Start of the Empire===
Life continued in a generally happy fashion until Geppetto was approached by the elders of the local community who were growing increasingly concerned about the erratic behaviour of the local Count.   They proposed that he should be replaced; that Geppetto should create a [[Imposter|double]] for the Count, persuade the Blue Fairy to turn him human, then, at some suitable point, replace the Count with his double.   Despite initial misgivings, as the plan clearly had to involve the murder of the real Count, the switch was made and sanity settled back into the land.   The new Count ruled wisely, but eventually the time came for him to pass away.   His son was highly incompetent, so the decision was made to repeat the procedure.

As time passed, the process became habitual, and it wasn't too long before every major ruling official within range had been replaced by one of Geppetto's duplicates, and thus, through the Blue Fairy's magic, all of them were loyal to him.   However, the Fairy ultimately tired of the game, putting Geppetto in a problematic situation.  With his co-conspirators hungry to expand the territory that they controlled, the inability to turn the duplicates human was a problem.   Geppetto began to research the magic himself; many of the lords under his control had court magicians in their service and were able to send them to Geppetto to instruct him in the ways of magic.   Within a short period of time, Geppetto came to understand how the Blue Fairy performed her magic, but he lacked her unique magical nature, which acted as her power source.    During her next visit, he solved that problem by attacking her and hooking her up to a system that allowed him to create elixirs from her body that could turn his duplicates human.&lt;ref name=&quot;vert-ency&quot;/&gt;

===Becoming Emperor===
Geppetto now faced up to the problem of his co-conspirators.   Too many people knew about what was happening and he felt that it would only be a matter of time before one of them revealed it.  Some obligingly died of old age, but others were of Fablekind and refused to age.    Acting entirely alone, Geppetto proceeded to kill and replace the remaining conspirators, while also continuing to replace local government officials from the surrounding areas.   Without him really realising it, Geppetto's empire was well under way.

Expansion became the key to maintaining his empire, and Geppetto had by now developed a taste for ruling, taking the view that it was better that he should be in charge than someone who might prove to be less benevolent.    However, a new problem had arisen.   His empire had expanded to the extent that the nearby leaders were complete strangers to him, so it would not be possible to surreptitiously replace them.   Subterfuge was no longer an option.   Fortunately, by this point, Geppetto had control over a considerable military force, through the various lords under his control.  Augmented by magically summoned creatures, his armies were able to overwhelm most opposition with some ease, especially since few (if any) expected the attacks.  Geppetto also created the figure of the Emperor, a massively imposing figure, heavily armoured, to be his figurehead to inspire martial loyalty and to strike fear into enemy forces.

The empire continued to expand, operating on a fifty-year cycle of expansion and consolidation.  Geppetto himself tends to stay out of direct control, allowing his sons and daughters, now numbering in the tens of thousands, to handle the day-to-day running of the empire.   Geppetto prefers to remain in his cottage workshop, only occasionally getting involved to set policy and broad goals for the empire.

At the time of the Fables stories, the empire has absorbed all of the European Fable worlds (with a few exceptions, such as the kingdom of the North Wind) and is beginning a new expansion cycle, launching an assault on the Arabian fables.

===Dealings with Fabletown===
Geppetto's attitude towards [[Fabletown]] was, for the most part, one of general disinterest.  With many worlds for his Empire still to absorb, the mundane world was of little interest, and those Fables who had escaped there were  of limited interest for the time being, although he did still consider them to be his subjects, albeit in what he considered to be self-imposed exile.   He did not, however, intend to allow Fabletown to be a distraction and sent in a unit of his elite wooden soldiers with the aim of reclaiming all those magical items that the escaping Fables had managed to take with them when they fled (although it is implied that this was not the army's only purpose, as they apparently had plans to kill some of the Fables even if Fabletown did not resist).  He sent them under the command of [[List of characters in Fables#Baba Yaga|Baba Yaga]], masquerading as [[List of characters in Fables#Red Riding Hood|Red Riding Hood]], who he announced to the denizens of Fabletown was his Imperial Envoy, who would work to achieve reconciliation between them.   Fabletown chose to resist and neither Baba Yaga nor any of the wooden soldiers returned to the Homelands.

His next encounter with Fabletown was the one-man invasion of the Homelands by [[Boy Blue (Fables)|Boy Blue]]. Armed with powerful magical artifacts, Blue caused a remarkable amount of disruption, slaying several Imperial governors as he made his way closer to the Imperial capitol, where he infiltrated the Emperor's throne room and decapitated the Emperor, who reverted to his original wooden form.   Captured by the [[List of characters in Fables#The Snow Queen|Snow Queen]], Blue was brought to Geppetto, and the two conversed for some time, while Geppetto worked on repairing the Emperor puppet ready for returning him to a living form; Blue also returned Pinocchio's body to his grateful father, who had little difficulty in reviving his wayward offspring.   Shortly afterwards, however, it became apparent that Blue had allowed himself to be captured in order to discover the true identity of the Adversary.  Escaping with ease, he attempted to kill Geppetto, but failed due to the sheer number of protective spells that surrounded the older Fable.   Angrily, Geppetto swore to send the Snow Queen after Blue to get revenge. Disturbed and confused, Pinocchio chose to stay with his father when Blue left.

His anger with Fabletown grew even further after their next encounter.  [[Bigby Wolf]] infiltrated the Homelands and broke into Geppetto's cottage, where he explained that Fabletown would be adopting what he referred to as the [[Israel]] template.   Any hurt inflicted on Fabletown would be returned several times over.   Bigby then demonstrated this policy by using [[plastic explosive]] to destroy the grove of magical trees that Geppetto used to create the wooden soldiers, in retaliation for their assault on Fabletown.   The resulting fire also destroyed Geppetto's cottage.

After these events, Geppetto finally decided that Fabletown had to be dealt with, and called a conference of the Imperial elite to discuss possible options.  Although the final discussions at the conference had yet to be revealed, he seemed to have decided to wage all-out war on the mundane world, possibly to ultimately use the devastated world as a prison.   He dispatched [[List of characters in Fables#Hansel|Hansel]] to Fabletown, ostensibly as an official envoy, but really with the mission of retrieving Baba Yaga and the surviving wooden soldiers and return them to the Homelands.   As a result of Pinocchio's report on the likely retaliation from the mundane world, Geppetto decided that all the Fables in the mundane world will have to be assassinated prior to their attack, in order to prevent them from informing the mundane authorities of the source of the invasion and rallying them against the Empire.   He ordered the Snow Queen to make the necessary plans and to contact Hansel to impress on him the urgency of his mission.   Geppetto intended the attack to take place in three years time.

This all changed when [[Flycatcher (comics)|Flycatcher]] engaged and completed his quest in forming a new kingdom called Haven.  The Empire dispatched armies to destroy the newly formed land, but found themselves disabled as the spirits Flycatcher brought with him in the journey overwhelmed them.  Making matters worse, the fallen soldiers jumped at Flycatcher's proposition to become citizens of Haven since the alternative would have been to return to the Empire to be killed for failure.  Impatient, Geppetto ordered all of his Wooden Soldiers to march into Haven and crush it to the ground.  However, the magical armor worn by Flycatcher added itself to the magic of the Sacred Grove, causing all the soldiers to sprout into trees and becoming a new Sacred Grove.  Because there could only be one Sacred Grove in all the worlds, Geppetto's would never grow back and the magic he had used from it was now bestowed upon Flycatcher.

The loss of the soldiers, a number of them having been sons he had constructed in the past, caused Geppetto to fall into a deep depression, cared for only by one of his enchanted daughters.  This left the rest of the Empire to battle the suddenly invading opposition from Fabletown themselves.  The Empire ultimately failed, thanks in large part to Pinocchio revealing vital information in exchange for Geppetto to sign the Fabletown Compact and become a citizen of Fabletown.  This managed to happen as Pinocchio realized that the loyalty spells were only so that he would act in Geppetto's best interest and he strongly believed that surrender was in his father's best interest.

Geppetto was none too happy that he no longer had an empire to run and was forced to follow the rules as a citizen of Fabletown.  It was during a tour of the city with Pinocchio, aided very closely by Beast, Grimble and Hobbes, that he witnessed firsthand what he had done to the people who were forced out of their home world, but refused to believe that he did anything that was not in what he felt was the best interest of the people.  Being a sorcerer, Geppetto lives on the thirteenth floor of The Woodlands building with the other magic users.  However, he learned rather quickly that his links to outside sources had been severed and could only use spells when [[Frau Totenkinder]] allowed him to.

Geppetto was responsible for Mr. Dark's imprisonment, having recognized the threat he posed.  When Mr. Dark escaped, the enchantments upon Fabletown began to fade until all of the structures collapsed.  Geppetto only told riddles about the true nature of what happened before he was forced to join the others in relocating to the Farm.  Soon after arriving, he slipped away from Pinocchio only to find himself confronted by Reynard The Fox, King Noble, and other animal residents.  Geppetto maintained the protection spells that kept him from being harmed by their attack, but the animals then decided to bury him alive deep in the middle of the forest.

Geppetto was eventually freed from his burial imprisonment from a heavy rain which washed away the dirt over his burial spot.  Seeking protection, Geppetto allied himself with Grandfather Oak, the oldest tree in the forests around the Fabletown Farm.  Grandfather Oak provided Geppetto with two dryads, Prince Aspen and Princess Alder, as bodyguards.

Returning to the Farm, Geppetto sought election as the new head of the Farm, promising to solve the problem of Mr. Dark as he had many centuries ago.  The Farm was split on what to do but when Rose Red, official leader of the Farm, recovered from a temporary suicidal depression, she put a quick end to Geppetto's move and appointed him one of her advisors. He is currently attempting to put a small wooden soldier spy in the new Sacred Grove so that he may learn its secrets and use it to replenish his power and salvage his Empire.

==Personality==
Outwardly, Geppetto remains the amiable woodcarver of legend, polite and caring.   His pleasant exterior, however, hides an utterly ruthless man whose forces are responsible for countless deaths across the Fable lands.   He cares for his children, particularly Pinocchio.  He does not seem to consider attacking Fabletown before he can steal back or negotiate the return of the damaged but still conscious heads of the soldiers he lost in &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers.&quot;

He is apparently reasonably magnanimous when he considers himself to have the upper hand, as when he felt that he had Boy Blue as his prisoner.  His mask slips, however, when crossed. He beat Pinocchio after he presented him with a wooden bug he carved from the mystic grove. Geppetto threw him out of his cottage telling his confused son &quot;no one carves from there but me!&quot; Upon his arrival in Fabletown and signing of the compact that granted him immunity for his past actions, he is frequently condescending or hostile (albeit nonviolently so), often treating others as though he was still an emperor. This attitude fails to ingratiate himself to the citizens of Fabletown.

==Powers and abilities==
While not physically strong, Geppetto has learned a great deal of magic over the years from the various wizards belonging to the lords under his control, to the extent that he should probably be considered a sorcerer of considerable power.   He has every protective spell imaginable laid over him, making him effectively impregnable - he even shrugs off a blow from the [[Vorpal]] Blade, although he does express considerable surprise that the Blade actually remained intact, the only weapon ever to do so. Like all Fables, he is effectively ageless.

As the true power behind the empire, Geppetto has enormous power in the Homelands, even if that fact remains unrecognised by the vast majority of its citizens.   To all intents and purposes his will is absolute within the borders of the empire. He has a huge military force at his disposal, along with considerable magical resources.

He remains a talented woodcarver and while he had access to his magic grove, he continued to make new children at a rate that he estimated to be around twenty per year.   With the recent destruction of the magic grove that provided the wood and [[Flycatcher (comics)|Flycatcher's]] recent acquisition of the grove's power, however, this is no longer possible.

==Original plan==
Willingham originally intended for the Adversary to be revealed as [[Peter Pan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vert-ency&quot;/&gt;  Peter would come to our world to steal children so they would remain young, becoming more corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |issue=185 |publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it would turn out that [[Captain Hook]] was actually the hero attempting to rescue the children. However, DC discovered that Peter Pan was not in the public domain in Great Britain, unlike other &quot;Fables&quot; characters, and thus could not be used. Willingham thus used Geppetto, an idea he has since seen as better. The alias &quot;'''The Adversary'''&quot; appears based on &quot;'''The Enemy''',&quot; the common term for [[Sauron]] in the ''Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = O'Shea | first = Tom | title = &quot;This is a Wonderful Job&quot;: An Orca Q&amp;A with Fables' Bill Willingham | date = 2003 | url = http://www.orcafresh.net/interview/in020503.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050429103441/http://www.orcafresh.net/interview/in020503.html |archivedate = 2005-04-29}} Interview with Bill Willingham&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hook and Pan make a brief appearance in [[1001 Nights of Snowfall]], fighting each other. It has also been theorized that the title &quot;The Adversary&quot; could be derived from Jewish and Christian literature where the name &quot;Satan&quot; actually comes from the Hebrew word for &quot;Adversary.&quot;

'''Gerald Chapman''' (August, 1887 – April 6, 1926), known as &quot;'''The Count of [[Gramercy Park]]'''&quot;,&quot;'''The Gentleman Bandit'''&quot; and &quot;'''Gentleman Gerald'''&quot;, was an American criminal who helped lead an early [[Prohibition]]-era gang from 1919 until the mid-1920s. Chapman was the first criminal to be dubbed &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot; by the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;PE#1&quot;&gt;{{harv|&quot;The First 'Public Enemy Number One'&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes and escapes==
Gerald Chapman was born '''George Chartres''' in August 1887 to parents of [[Irish people|Irish]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Downey|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrested for the first time in 1902 at age fourteen, Chapman was incarcerated for most of his early adult life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jeffers|1993|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While serving time for [[bank robbery]], he was transferred from [[Sing Sing]] to [[Auburn State Prison]], and became acquainted with highly educated Danish-born con man [[Dutch Anderson|George &quot;Dutch&quot; Anderson]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jeffers|1993|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Anderson as his mentor, Chapman became a voracious reader and a self-styled gentleman, often affecting a British accent. Following both men's [[parole]]s in 1919, they began [[rum-running|bootlegging]] operations in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Miami]] and [[New York City]] over the next two years.

In late 1921, along with former Auburn inmate Charles Loeber, Chapman and Anderson began committing armed robberies. On October 24,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|New York Times|25 October 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; the three men forced a [[U.S. Mail]] truck to stop at gunpoint on Leonard Street, successfully taking $2.4 million in cash, bonds and jewelry. Their identities were unknown to the police for months, and Chapman lived the life of an aristocrat, residing with his mistress in New York's fashionable Gramercy Park neighborhood. The three men were eventually arrested by United States Postal Inspectors William Doran, Jim Doyle and William Cochraine on July 3, 1922, after Chapman attempted to sell Argentine gold notes (stolen during the Leonard Street mail robbery) to an undercover postal inspector posing as a stock broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jeffers|1993|pp=77, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman made headlines when he briefly got away from his interrogators at police headquarters, but he was caught before he could leave the building.

Chapman and Anderson were both sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment and ordered to serve their time at the [[Atlanta Federal Prison]]. Chapman escaped from the prison on March 27, 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jeffers|1993|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; knocking out the facility's power in the process. He was wounded and captured a couple of days later in eastern Georgia, but within a week escaped the hospital, adding to his national notoriety. Anderson broke out of the Atlanta prison on December 30, 1923. The two men reunited, and were suspected by authorities in several hold-ups.

On October 12, 1924, while on a crime spree in [[Connecticut]], Chapman murdered Officer James Skelly of the [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jeffers|1993|pp=154–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officer was killed in a gunfight with Chapman after interrupting a theft at a store. Though an accomplice was caught and quickly identified Chapman as the perpetrator, authorities initially refused to believe that the notorious bandit had been operating unnoticed in their area. Chapman's role was eventually confirmed through other evidence.

==Capture==
Chapman was recaptured on January 18, 1925, in [[Muncie, Indiana]], based on authorities being tipped off by informant Ben Hance. During his apprehension, Chapman fired at a police officer but missed. President [[Calvin Coolidge]] was convinced to reduce the robbery sentence of Chapman in federal prison to time served,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jeffers|1993|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chapman was then handed over to the Connecticut authorities.

Hance and his wife were shot to death when their car was forced off a road outside Muncie on August 11, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jeffers|1993|pp=221–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities blamed the killings on Anderson and an accomplice (who was later convicted), and the suspected motive was revenge for Chapman's incarceration. On October 31, 1925, &quot;Dutch&quot; Anderson and Police Officer Charles Hammond died in a shootout in [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PE#1&quot;/&gt;

==Trial and execution==
During Chapman's six-day murder trial in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], crowds gathered due to his status as one of the &quot;top 10&quot; criminals in America. The jury deliberated for 11 hours, after which Chapman was found guilty and eventually sentenced to [[hanging|hang]]. He proclaimed his innocence to the end, asking in his final appeal for &quot;justice, not mercy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|New York Times|6 April 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman was executed by the [[upright jerker]] on April 6, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Jeffers|1993|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|&quot;Executions in Connecticut Since 1894&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerald Fit Mason''' (born January 26, 1934) is an [[United States|American]] rapist and cop killer. Mason's 2003 arrest and prosecution for the 1957 murder of two [[El Segundo, California]] police officers made national headlines.

==Criminal career==
Born in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], he was arrested and did time for burglary in that state in 1956. After his release in 1957, then aged 23, he hitchhiked his way to California, stopping in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] where he purchased a [[revolver]] using an [[pseudonym|alias]]. He later stated that it was purchased for protection while hitchhiking.

In [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]], [[California]], Mason came upon four teenagers at a local [[lover's lane]]. Drawing his revolver, Mason forced the two couples to strip down to their underwear and bound and blindfolded them. He then raped one of the girls. Leaving the teens alive as they were, Mason then drove off in their 1949 Ford sedan, ran a [[Traffic light|red light]], and was pulled over by Officers Richard Phillips and Milton Curtis of the El Segundo Police Department.

Mason later recalled, &quot;I thought, 'If I don't get them, they're gonna get me.' So when the officer turned away from me, I shot both officers, got back in the car and drove away.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ghosts&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/01/48hours/main646786.shtml The Ghosts Of El Segundo]&lt;/ref&gt; Backup units and medical personnel arrived onscene to find Curtis dead in his patrol car, with Phillips lying mortally wounded on the ground. Both had been shot three times. Meanwhile, Mason, who had been wounded by a bullet from Officer Phillips, dumped the car and fled through numerous backyards before hitchhiking his way to safety.

==Investigation==
The murders of Officers Phillips and Curtis touched off a homicide investigation that continued for more than half a century. In 1960, the murder weapon was recovered a mile from the crime in a back yard. The serial number was traced to a purchase at Sears in Shreveport, Louisiana, under the alias George D. Wilson. The signature was matched to &quot;Wilson's&quot; signature on a [[YMCA]] receipt, located near the Sears store. El Segundo detectives proceeded to track down every George D. Wilson in the [[United States]]. However, all were ruled out and the investigation went cold.

For the next 45 years, Mason was a law-abiding citizen, never getting so much as a [[parking ticket]]. He owned two service stations, had married and raised a family. He was later described by friends and neighbors as friendly and helpful.

In 2002, with advances of computerized finger-printing technology, the FBI decided to expand the system to include prints collected during arrests in all 50 states. A match based on the partial left thumb prints lifted from the steering wheel of the stolen car, came back about a man convicted of burglary in 1956 in Columbia. He had served time for that case. Besides the matching [[fingerprint]] the evidence was also based on matching handwriting, linking him to the murder weapon.

Police located Mason, who had returned to and was still living in his hometown of [[Columbia, South Carolina]].  He was a wealthy retiree and a grandfather, quietly living with his family in a [[suburban]] neighborhood. Then, in January 2003, a large group of police officers called at his door. Mason was completely shocked and had asked where they were from. The police officers had said, &quot;We are from the El Segundo Police Department,&quot; and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  Mason then said, &quot;You're homicide detectives? I think I need a lawyer.&quot; The police officers then told him that they were there because of the murder of two police officers in 1957. Horrified, Mason responded, &quot;You're here for that?&quot;

Following his arrest, Mason was further identified by the bullet graze wound scar on his back, from a bullet fired by Officer Phillips in 1957.

Confronted with so much evidence, Mason admitted to detectives that he stumbled upon the teenagers while intoxicated. Afterwards, he shot both police officers in an attempt to cover up the rapes, robbery, and theft of the car. Mason further told detectives, &quot;I really don't have an explanation for why this happened. I wish I did.&quot; When asked why he had raped a 15-year-old girl, Mason responded that he no longer remembered.

==Sentencing==
Mason pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two consecutive [[life imprisonment|life terms]], with a minimum of 7 years. At his sentencing hearing, Mason tearfully apologized to the families of Officers Phillips and Curtis. He said, &quot;It's impossible to express to so many people how sorry I am. I do not understand why I did this. It does not fit in my life. It is not the person I know. I detest these crimes.&quot;&lt;ref name=ghosts /&gt;

One El Segundo Detective commented, &quot;He was remorseful. But I think he was more sad and more sorry for having been caught.&quot;&lt;ref name=ghosts /&gt;

Mason was turned down for parole in 2009. He will be eligible for [[parole]] again in 2017.California prosecutors have vowed that he will never be released.

Mason is currently incarcerated in South Carolina, as his [[plea bargain]] granted him approval to serve his prison sentence near his family.

The widow of Officer Curtis commented, &quot;I'm not his victim anymore. My son is not his victim anymore. I'm so grateful, and I had to wait this long. It's worth the wait.&quot;

In a 2003 interview with [[People Magazine]], Jerri Mason Whittaker, Gerald Mason's daughter, said, &quot;There really aren't words to describe the range of emotions we've gone through.&quot; Even so, she insisted, &quot;I could not have had a better father.&quot;

This story was shown on episodes of [[Forensic Files]], [[48 Hours Mystery]] and Murder Book.

}}'''Gerald Parker''' (born around 1955)&lt;!-- 41 in 1996 --&gt;&lt;!-- 43 in 1999 per Yi1 --&gt; is a [[serial killer]] who raped and murdered five [[Orange County, California]] women, attacked a sixth, and killed her unborn child; the crimes took place in the 1970s, but he was discovered some  17 years later via DNA, convicted and sentenced to death in January, 1999.  The murders that he committed took place in the cities of Costa Mesa, Tustin, and Anaheim.&lt;ref name=&quot;cekola&quot; /&gt;

==Background==
The public record of Parker's [[Crime|offenses]] began with a term in Juvenile Hall in the 1960s for glue-sniffing.&lt;ref name=&quot;granberry&quot; /&gt; Parker received a six-year prison term for the 1980 rape of a 14-year-old girl from [[Tustin, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cekola&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-22/news/mn-17543_1_police-and-navy-officials|title=Releases JUSTICE DELAYED / DNA EVIDENCE FREES ONE MAN, POINTS TO ANOTHER IN 1979 CASE : Heating the Cold Trail of the 'Bludgeon Killer'|date=June 22, 1996|newspaper=Los Angeles times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the murders he was stationed at the El Toro, California, Marine Air Station.&lt;ref name=&quot;cekola&quot; /&gt;

==Crimes==
In 1978 and 1979 Parker raped and murdered five [[Orange County, California]], women. He also attacked a sixth woman and killed her unborn child.&lt;ref name=&quot;cekola&quot; /&gt; The women were murdered by bludgeoning them with a 2x4 [[Lumber|piece of lumber]], a hammer, or a mallet.&lt;ref name=&quot;cekola&quot; /&gt; For this reason he was nicknamed the &quot;Bedroom Basher.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yi2&quot; /&gt;

Kevin Lee Green, the husband of the woman who survived the attack—but whose unborn child was killed—was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent 16 years in prison before he was freed in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;yi2&quot; /&gt;

New [[DNA]] technology identified Parker's involvement in the crimes in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;hua&quot; /&gt; Parker was in prison at that time. He was confronted with the evidence and confessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;keppel&quot;/&gt; He was convicted in October 1998 on six counts of first degree murder, six counts of first degree rape, and one count of first degree attempted murder.

In January 1999, Parker was sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]], plus [[life without possibility of parole]], plus 64 years in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;yi2&quot; /&gt;

'''Gerald Eugene Stano''' (September 12, 1951 – March 23, 1998) was an [[United States|American]] convicted [[serial killer]]. He killed at least 22 women; he confessed to killing 41.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Schenectady, New York]]. His given name at birth was '''Paul Zeininger'''. His natural mother neglected him to such an extent that when she finally gave him up for [[adoption]] when he was six months old, county doctors declared him unadoptable because he was functioning at what they described as &quot;an animalistic level&quot;, even ingesting his own [[faeces]] to survive. He was eventually [[adoption|adopted]], however, by Norma Stano, a nurse, who renamed him Gerald Eugene Stano.

By all accounts, the Stanos were loving parents, but discipline problems nevertheless plagued their adopted son all his life. He earned C's and D's in all subjects in school (except music, at which he excelled). He was a [[Bedwetting|bed wetter]] until the age of 10.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} He lied compulsively and was once caught stealing money from his father's wallet to pay fellow members of the track and field team to finish behind him, so he would not be viewed as a complete failure. He graduated high school at the age of 21 and did not attend college.

==Murders==
Officially, Stano admitted that he began killing in the early 1970s, when he was in his 20s but also claimed to have begun killing in the late 1960s, at the age of 18. Several girls had gone missing in Stano's area of residence at that time, but since insufficient [[evidence|physical evidence]] was found when these claims were investigated almost 20 years later, Stano was never charged. He was most active in [[Florida]] and [[New Jersey]]. By his 29th birthday, he was in prison for murdering 41 women. He was housed with fellow serial killer [[Ted Bundy]] until Bundy's execution in 1989.

==Execution==
Stano was [[death penalty|executed]] by [[electric chair]] on March 23, 1998 in [[Florida State Prison]]. For his [[final meal]] Stano requested Delmonico steak, a baked potato with sour cream and bacon bits, tossed salad with blue cheese dressing, lima beans, a half gallon of mint chocolate-chip ice cream, and 2 litres of Pepsi. Stano's final statement proclaimed innocence and directed blame for his false confessions at the lead investigator, Paul Crow.

==Controversy==
Controversy has long accompanied Gerald Stano's criminal history, with some{{Who|date=April 2011}} believing that Stano was actually a '[[serial confessor]]', including his arresting officer, Detective James Gadberry, who challenged the decision to accept Stano's first confessions as valid and, in 1986, signed a legal [[affidavit]] stating unequivocally that Sergeant Paul Crow was responsible for &quot;spoon feeding&quot; Stano the intimate details of unsolved homicides. According to Gadberry's affidavit, Stano merely parroted the information back to Crow while other veteran homicide officers later made statements to the effect that, they too, had witnessed Paul Crow 'helping' Stano to confess to crimes he had not committed.

Crow's colleagues {{Who|date=April 2011}} recalled how he actively gathered information on unsolved or &quot;[[cold case (criminology)|cold case]]&quot; murders from foreign jurisdictions. During sworn testimony in Orlando Federal Appeals Court in 1993, Crow himself recalled using copies of stories from the local newspaper to locate details about murders to which Stano later confessed, including the murder for which Stano was later executed.

In 1995, Crow was removed from office by a grand jury appointed by [[Governor of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Lawton Chiles]], citing corruption.

Further controversy surrounded the fact that Stano, in spite of his 41 murder confessions, was brought to trial for just one homicide: that of 17-year-old Cathy Lee Scharf, who was murdered in December 1973. A conspicuous lack of physical evidence [[corroboration|corroborating]] Stano's confessions made it virtually impossible for jurisdictions in Florida to prosecute, and Stano's previous convictions were exclusively the result of his own guilty pleas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Following a [[hung jury]], prosecutors introduced the testimony of a [[Informant#Jailhouse informants|jailhouse informant]], Clarence Zacke, who was later discredited when another man against whom he had testified, Wilton Dedge, was released after serving 22 years for [[rape]]; lawyers for the [[Innocence Project]] established that his [[DNA]] did not match that found on the victim.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

During a secretly recorded conversation with freelance reporter Arthur Nash in 1997, Zacke admitted that he had lied regarding Stano and other defendants, including Wilton Dedge. He said his testimony had been fabricated with the assistance of two county prosecutors, who offered him incentives in exchange for testimony.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In late 2007, an [[FBI]] lab report surfaced which concluded that Stano could not have been the source of unidentified [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] [[pubic hair]]s that were recovered from Scharf's body. The report was never presented as evidence by the public defender representing Stano. The source of the pubic hairs was not identified, and they were destroyed shortly after Stano's execution in the Florida electric chair in 1998.

'''Gerald Armond Gallego''' (July 17, 1946 – July 18, 2002) and '''Charlene Adelle Gallego''' (born Charlene Adelle Williams, October 10, 1956) are two [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]s who terrorized [[Sacramento, California]] between 1978 and 1980. They killed a total of 10 victims, mostly teenagers, whom they kept as [[sex slave]]s before killing them.

==Charlene Adelle Gallego==
Charlene Gallego (Charlene Adelle Williams) was born  near Sacramento, California, in October 1956. Her father, Charles, was a respected entrepreneur who was the vice president of a supermarket chain. He and his wife, Mercedes, regularly traveled as part of their business life. Early school reports suggest Charlene was a quiet and shy child who had good attendance. Charlene's mother Mercedes was involved in a car accident, leaving her badly hurt and causing her not to travel as often. Due to the accident, Charlene took over her mother's duties and would often travel with her father to meet his clients who would praise the intelligent and well-spoken child.

By high school Charlene had begun using drugs. She also drank heavily and bragged about having a black lover. Young Charlene was very promiscuous, but her parents were in denial.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Carol Anne. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0749005726 Women Who Kill, Profiles of Female Serial Killers]. Brixton, London: Allison &amp; Busby Limited. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Bernie. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1558177396 Families Who Kill]. New York: Pinnacle Books. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Barri Flowers|Flowers, R. Barri]]. ''The Sex Slave Murders'', New York: St. Martins Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Eric Van. A Venom In The Blood Pinnacle Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/gallego/charlene_2.html Macleod, Marlee]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://serialkillers.briancombs.net/tag/charlene-gallego/ |title=Charlene Gallego: Demographic Info |website=serialkillers.briancombs.net |access-date=30 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlene married a wealthy, introverted  man who was dependent on heroin. She was using large amounts of cocaine and she didn't care about her appearance. Her first husband hated that Charlene's parents often intervened in their relationship. The marriage failed. She married another man&amp;nbsp;– a soldier. She described him as a &quot;mommy's boy&quot; and grew bored with him, causing them to quickly divorce [citation needed]. Charlene had a brief affair with a married man. He ended the affair after she suggested that they should have sex with his wife. Charlene was devastated and attempted suicide. It was not long after this when Charlene met Gerald.

After her release from prison, Charlene Gallego moved to Fair Oaks, California, and changed her name to Mary Martinez. She operated questionable charity companies following the death of her and Gallego's son in the war. She may also have lived in Roseville.

==Gerald Gallego==
Gerald had a brutal childhood—he was beaten by his mother and her numerous boyfriends. He was constantly left starving and grew up desperate for love. His father was a convicted murderer who was executed for the murder of two policemen. He had failed as a lover and a husband; and, by the age of thirty-two, he'd left numerous women. He also had a daughter, whom he abused sexually. When he met Charlene, they fell insanely in love and enjoyed rough sex, with Charlene being the submissive. Within a week of meeting, they rented a house together.  Charlene accepted that he was interested only in his own sexual satisfaction. Gerald brought home a sixteen-year-old dancer. They had a threesome, but the women were not allowed to touch each other. The next day he returned home from work to find the women in bed having sex. Enraged, he threw the young dancer out the window and beat Charlene; he also withheld sex from her for a month. It seems he no longer found her attractive as she was no longer sexually dependent on him.

Gerald sodomized his fourteen-year-old daughter and her friend, but it is unclear whether Charlene was in the same room or just in the apartment. With Gerald now unable to become sexually excited, one of the couple suggested kidnapping women to become sex slaves. Sources suggest that it was Charlene who broached the idea.

== Victims ==

=== Rhonda Scheffler and Kippi Vaught ===
On September 10, 1978, Rhonda Scheffler (age 17) and Kippi Vaught (age 16) were shopping at Country Club Plaza in [[Sacramento County]] when Charlene enticed them into their van.

Gerald and Charlene raped and further sexually abused the two victims throughout the night in rural [[Placer County]]. Evidence showed that Charlene bit the breasts of one victim; and Gerald, the other. The next day, the Gallegos drove back to Sacramento County, where Gerald made Rhonda and Kippi get out of the van and walk across a field to a ditch. He hit the girls with a tire iron and shot them in the head with a 25-caliber pistol. As Gerald was walking back to the van, he saw one of the victims (later revealed to be Kippi Vaught) move; the bullet had only grazed her skull.  He returned and shot her three more times in the head, killing her. Charlene would later tell a cellmate how ecstatic she felt during this kidnap-rape.

=== Brenda Judd and Sandra Colley ===
On June 24, 1979, Brenda Judd (age 14) and Sandra Colley (age 13) were lured into the Gallegos' van at the [[Washoe County, Nevada]], Fair with the promise of making some money delivering leaflets. Charlene drove northeast out of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] on I-80 while, in the back of the van, Gerald repeatedly [[rape]]d the girls as Charlene watched in the rearview mirror.

Charlene found a place to park in a desolate area known as [[Humboldt Sink]]. Gerald took a shovel and pulled Sandra Colley out of the vehicle, marching her toward a dry creek bed. He then stepped behind her and swung the shovel. Charlene would later recall the moment as the sound of &quot;a loud splat like a flat rock hitting mud, and the girl sank to her knees and slowly toppled over on her face.&quot; Gerald beat Brenda Judd to death and then dug a deep hole; he folded their naked bodies into it and placed a rock over the grave.

The teenagers were listed as runaways for four years, until Charlene confessed to their murders during the 1982 trial. In November 1999, their remains were discovered by a tractor operator.

=== Stacey Redican and Karen Chipman Twiggs ===
On April 24, 1980, the Gallegos' kidnapped Stacey Redican and Karen Chipman Twiggs from Sunrise Mall in [[Citrus Heights, California]]. As with their other victims, Gerald and Charlene sexually abused and killed them.

=== Other victims ===
*Linda Aguilar and unborn child buried alive per Charlene's testimony

Also Virginia Mochel - On July 17, 1980, 34-year-old Virginia Mochel was abducted from the parking lot of a West Sacramento tavern, where she worked as a barmaid. Her skeletal remains, still bound with nylon fishing line, were found outside of Clarksburg, California, on October 30. In the absence of other evidence, loops of cord around the neck were seen as proof of death by strangulation.

===Craig Miller and Mary Elizabeth Sowers===
In the early morning hours of November 2, 1980, Gerald saw a young couple, twenty-two-year-old Craig Miller, and his fiancée, twenty-one-year-old Mary Elizabeth Sowers, in the parking lot of Arden Fair mall. In his most brazen attempt yet, Gerald got out of the car, walked right up to them, pulled out a .25 caliber Beretta, pointed it in the couple's faces, and ordered them into the car. Friends of the young couple saw them get into the vehicle and wrote down the license plate number. After driving to a secluded area, Gerald commanded Craig out of the car, as the young man turned to walk towards the front of the vehicle, Gerald aimed his pistol and shot Craig at point-blank range in the back of the head in view of Mary. Gerald then fired two more shots into Craig’s head, as he lay lifeless on the ground. Gerald got back into the vehicle and ordered Charlene to drive to their apartment. Once back at the apartment, Gerald took his new sex slave into the bedroom and raped her for hours on end. Gerald then ordered Charlene to drive Mary and him to a rural area. Once there, Gerald ordered Mary out of the car. He then shot her three times at point blank range.

==Trials==
In 1984, Gerald Gallego was tried for murder in both California and Nevada. In both instances, Charlene testified against him. In exchange for her testimony, Charlene was not charged in California and she agreed to plead guilty to murder and receive a sentence of sixteen years and eight months in Nevada. Gerald was convicted in both states and was sentenced to death in both states. His death sentence in Nevada was overturned in 1999 and he won the right to a new sentencing hearing, but the new jury also sentenced him to death.

Charlene Gallego was released from prison in Nevada in July 1997. Gerald Gallego died of [[rectal cancer]] on July 18, 2002 at the Nevada prison system's medical center.

'''Gerard John Schaefer, Jr.''' (March 25, 1946 &amp;ndash; December 3, 1995) was an American murderer and suspected [[serial killer]] from [[Florida]]. He was imprisoned in 1973 for murders he committed as a [[Martin County, Florida]], Sheriff's deputy. While he was convicted of two murders, he was suspected of many others. Schaefer frequently appealed against his conviction, yet privately boasted &amp;mdash; both verbally and in writing &amp;mdash; of having murdered more than 30 women and girls.

==Early life==
Schaefer was the first of three children born to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] parents, Gerard and Doris Schaefer. He was born in Wisconsin and was raised in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] where he attended [[Marist School (Georgia)|Marist Academy]] until 1960, when he and his family moved to [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]. Schaefer did not get along well with his father, who he believed favored his sister. In his teens, Schaefer became obsessed with women's [[panties]] and also became a [[Voyeurism|peeping tom]], spying on a neighbor girl named Leigh Hainline. (In 1969, Schaefer murdered Hainline (see below).) He would later admit to [[zoosadism|killing animals]] in his youth and [[cross dressing]], although at other times he claimed the latter was solely to avoid the [[Conscription|draft]] into the [[Vietnam War]] (which he did).

After graduating from [[St. Thomas Aquinas High School (Fort Lauderdale, Florida)|St. Thomas Aquinas High School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/gerard_schaefer/3.html|title=Gerard Schaefer|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=TruTV|access-date=|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1964, Schaefer went to college, during which time he got married. In 1969 he became a teacher, but was soon fired for &quot;totally inappropriate behavior,&quot; according to the principal. After being turned down from the [[priesthood]], Schaefer turned to law enforcement as a career, graduating as a patrolman at the end of 1971, at the age of 25.

==Arrest==
On July 21, 1972, Schaefer, while on patrol, picked up two teenage girls who were [[hitchhiking]]. He abducted them, took them to some remote woods and tied them to trees where he threatened to kill them or sell them into [[prostitution]]. However, when he got a call on his police radio, Schaefer had to go, leaving the girls tied up. He vowed that he would return.

The two girls, who were aged 18 and 17, escaped their bonds and went to the nearest police station, which was actually their kidnapper's own station. When Schaefer returned to the woods and found his victims gone, he called his station and claimed that he had done &quot;something foolish&quot;, explaining that he had pretended to kidnap and threaten to kill two hitchhikers in order to scare them into avoiding such an irresponsible method of travel. Schaefer's boss did not believe him and he ordered Schaefer to the station where he stripped him of his badge and charged him with [[false imprisonment]] and [[assault]].

After posting [[bail]], Schaefer was released. Two months later, on September 27, 1972, Schaefer abducted, [[torture]]d, and murdered Susan Place, aged 17, and Georgia Jessup, 16, and buried them on [[Hutchinson Island (Florida)|Hutchinson Island]].

In December that year, Schaefer appeared in court in relation to the abduction of the two girls who had escaped his clutches back in July. Due to a [[plea bargain]], he was able to plead guilty to just one charge of [[aggravated assault]], for which he received a sentence of one year.

==Murder conviction==
In April 1973, over six months since they vanished, the [[decomposition|decomposing]], butchered remains of Susan Place and Georgia Jessup were found. The girls had been tied to a tree at some point and had vanished while hitch-hiking, and these similarities to Schaefer's treatment of the girls who had gotten away led police to obtain a [[search warrant]] for the home he and his wife (now divorced) shared with Schaefer's mother.

In Schaefer's bedroom, police found lurid stories he had written that were full of descriptions of the torture, [[rape]] and murder of women, whom Schaefer routinely referred to as &quot;whores&quot; and &quot;sluts&quot;. More damningly, the authorities found personal possessions such as [[jewelry]], [[Diary|diaries]] &amp;mdash; and in one case, [[teeth]] &amp;mdash; from at least eight young women and girls who had gone missing in recent years. Some of the jewelry was from Leigh Hainline Bonadies, who had lived next door to Schaefer when they were teenagers; Hainline Bonadies had vanished in 1969 in Ft. Lauderdale after leaving a note for her husband saying she was making a trip to Miami, but would be back in time to play tennis with him (Schaefer was never charged in connection with her case; her skull, which was found to have multiple bullet holes, was discovered at a construction site in Palm Beach County in April 1978 and identified one month later in May).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19780512&amp;id=T1RNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qfoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6167,3669114&amp;hl=en|title=Lakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also among the items was a purse identified as belonging to Susan Place. Place's mother later identified Schaefer as being the man she last saw with her daughter and Jessup.

Schaefer was charged with the murders of Place and Jessup. In October 1973, he was found guilty and given two [[life sentence]]s. Authorities soon stated that he was linked to around 30 missing women and girls.

Place and Jessup may not even have been Schaefer's final victims; two 14-year-old girls named Mary Briscolina and Elsie Farmer vanished while hitchhiking on October 23, 1972: just a few weeks after Place and Jessup were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ruth.buddell/schaefer.htm|title=Gerard Schaefer|last=|first=|date=|website=Murderers Database (United Kingdom)|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=September 3, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710153845/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ruth.buddell/schaefer.htm|archivedate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies were later recovered, and jewelry belonging to one of the girls was later found in Schaefer's home.

==Imprisonment and death==
Schaefer appealed his conviction, claiming at one point that he had been framed. All his appeals were rejected. Schaefer later began filing frivolous lawsuits, trying to sue one [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] writer, Patrick Kendrick, for describing him as &quot;an overweight, doughy, middle aged man who preyed on victims who were psychologically and physiologically weaker than him,&quot; and separately trying to sue authors [[Colin Wilson]] and [[Michael Newton (author)|Michael Newton]] and former FBI agent [[Robert Ressler]] for describing him (Schaefer) as a serial killer. All of Schaefer's lawsuits were thrown out of court, except Kendrick's which Schaefer continued until his  own murder in prison. He also wrote threatening letters to Kendrick, suggesting he had willing minions that would do his bidding and he &quot;...would hate to see something happen to your family...&quot;. Kendrick went on to write fiction novels often describing brutal murders, which he relates to his experience with Schaefer.

On December 3, 1995, Schaefer was found stabbed to death in his cell. He had been killed by fellow inmate Vincent Rivera. Rivera was convicted in 1999 of killing Schaefer and had 53 years and 10 months added to the life-plus-20 years sentence he was serving for double murder.

Rivera did not confess to the crime, nor give a motive. Schaefer's sister claimed that his murder was some sort of cover-up related to his attempts to verify the confession to the killing of [[Murder of Adam Walsh|Adam Walsh]] that [[Ottis Toole]] had made (and subsequently retracted). Others suggested it was due to Schaefer owing some prisoners money or rumors that he was a 'snitch' who had been informing on other inmates. [[Sondra London]] (see below) claimed Rivera killed Schaefer in an argument over a cup of coffee.

At the time of Schaefer's death, a Fort Lauderdale homicide detective had been proposing to file charges against Schaefer for three unsolved murders to ensure he never got out of prison.

==Alleged victims==

==''Killer Fiction''==
[[Sondra London]], a true crime writer who had been Schaefer's girlfriend in high school, interviewed him at length following his conviction, and in 1990 published a compilation of his short stories and drawings entitled ''Killer Fiction''. A second book, ''Beyond Killer Fiction'', followed two years later. Schaefer's stories typically involved savage, graphic torture and murder of women, usually from the perspective of the killer, who was often a rogue police officer.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, GJ. ''Killer Fiction: Tales of an Accused Serial Killer''. Media Queen (1990). ASIN B002RGCG7U&lt;/ref&gt;  A revised edition of ''Killer Fiction''. released well after Schaefer's death, included stories and rambling articles from the first two books and a collection of letters to London, in which Schaefer confessed to killing 34 women and girls, and bragged that he had impressed fellow inmate [[Ted Bundy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerard John Schaeffer's Art. [http://serialkillers.com/index.php/art/ Serial Killer Art and Kitsch.] Retrieved May 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

London noted that at the time Schaefer was corresponding with her, he was publicly proclaiming his innocence and threatening to sue anyone who labeled him a serial killer.  In one letter Schaefer wrote that he began murdering women in 1965, when he was 19.  In another, he boasted of killing and cannibalizing two schoolgirls, nine-year-old [http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2241dffl.html Peggy Rahn] and eight-year-old [http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2242dffl.html Wendy Stevenson], who vanished in December 1969.  Publicly, Schaefer had denied any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer GJ, London S. ''Killer Fiction''. Feral House (2011), pp. 82-90. ISBN 1936239191&lt;/ref&gt;

When London ended her association with Schaefer in 1991, after beginning a relationship with another Florida serial killer, [[Danny Rolling]], Schaefer repeatedly threatened her life and attempted to sue her for &quot;stealing&quot; his work.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer GJ, London S.

'''Gerard''' (or '''Geeraerd''') '''van Velsen''' (died 1296, at [[Leiden]]) was lord of [[Beverwijk]], [[Noordwijk]] and [[Velsen]].

He was the son of Albrecht van Velsen and Hildegonde.
Gerard was married to Machteld van Woerden, a sister of [[Herman VI van Woerden]]. In 1275 Gerard was named [[schout]] of [[Wijk aan Zee]].

In 1296 Gerard conspired together with [[Herman VI van Woerden|Herman van Woerden]], [[Gijsbrecht IV of Amstel]], Jan van Kuyk and Arnold van Benschop to kidnap [[Floris V, Count of Holland]]. Eventually, together with van Woerden and van Amstel, they imprisoned the count in the [[Muiderslot]]. After Floris V attempted to escape, Gerard personally killed the count by stabbing him 20 times. Afterwards he fled to castle [[Loenen-Kronenburg|Kronenburg]] near [[Loenen aan de Vecht]]. A few days later he was arrested and brought to [[Leiden]] to stand trial. There he was tortured for three days before being [[Quartered]].

Gerard's motive for the murder of Floris V was his wife's supposed rape by Floris, after which she committed [[suicide]].

{{BLP unsourced|date=November 2016}}
'''Gerardo Flores''' (born 1986) of [[Lufkin, Texas]], was convicted in 2005 of two counts of [[capital murder]] for giving his girlfriend, who was carrying twins, an at-home abortion the previous year. Prosecutors chose not to seek the death penalty, and so he was sentenced automatically to life in prison without the possibility of [[parole]] for 40 years. The conviction and sentence were denounced as the most draconian punishment for abortion in America in decades.

His girlfriend, Erica Basoria, was sixteen years old and five months pregnant at the time. She was unable to get an [[abortion]], so after her own attempts to induce [[miscarriage]] failed she called upon Flores to try stepping on her midsection. A week later she miscarried. Under Texas law a woman cannot be charged with causing the deaths of her own fetuses, so Flores alone stood trial.

'''Gerda Steinhoff'''  (January 29, 1922 – July 4, 1946) born in [[Wrzeszcz|Danzig-Langfuhr]] (''{{lang-pl|Wrzeszcz}}''), was a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] overseer following the 1939 [[Germany|German]] [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]].

==SS career==

In 1939, Steinhoff became a [[cooking|cook]], married and had one child. In 1944, because of the Nazi call for new guards, she joined the camp staff at [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]]. On October 1, 1944, she became a [[Blockleiterin]] in Stutthof women's camp [[SK-III]]. There, she took part in selections of prisoners to be sent to the [[gas chamber]]s. On October 31, 1944, she was promoted to [[SS-Oberaufseherin]] and was assigned to the [[Danzig-Holm]] subcamp.  On December 1, 1944 she was reassigned to [[Bromberg-Ost]] female subcamp of Stutthof located in [[Bydgoszcz]] not far from [[Gdańsk]]. There on January 25, 1945, she received a medal for her loyalty and service to the [[Third Reich]]. She was devoted to her job in the camps and was known as a very ruthless overseer. Soon before the end of [[World War II]], she fled the camp and went back home.

==Arrest, trial and execution==

On May 25, 1945, she was arrested by [[Polish people|Polish]] officials and sent to [[prison]]. She stood [[Stutthof Trial|trial]] with the other [[SS]] women and [[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapos]] and was convicted and [[Capital punishment|condemned to death]] for her involvement in the selections and what was called  her [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic]] abuse of prisoners.

'''Gerhard Friedrich Ernst Flesch''' (8 October 1909 – 28 February 1948) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Nazi]] executed for [[war crime]]s, specifically the [[torture]] and [[murder]] of members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[The Hunt for HitlerÕs Warship, by Patrick Bishop, p. 189 &lt;/ref&gt;

He was an ''Oberregierungsrat'' and held the rank of SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' (lieutenant colonel). He was born in [[Poznań|Posen]], [[Province of Posen]], [[German Empire]].  He became a member of [[NSDAP]] (Nazi Party) in 1933. In 1934, he obtained his law degree and by 1936 was a member of the [[Gestapo]], when [[Reinhard Heydrich]] appointed him over a unit to control the religious sects of [[Germany]]. In 1938, he took part in the German march into the [[Sudetenland]], and in 1939, in the annexation of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]]. Later he was appointed political adviser to [[Gauleiter]] [[Fritz Sauckel]] in [[Thuringia]]. After the outbreak of the war in September, 1939, he became leader of an ''[[Einsatzkommando]]'' in Poznań ({{lang-de|Posen}}). In 1940, he joined the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf]] in their march into [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;The One from the Other: A Bernie Gunther Novel
by Philip Kerr, pp. 8, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a position as ''[[Regierungsrat]]'' (Executive Council, government advisor), and was an SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' (major) in April 1940, when he was assigned to [[Norway]]. His first job in Norway was ''Kommandeur der [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]] und des [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]]'' in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (the ''Sicherheitsdienst'' (SD; Security Service) was primarily the intelligence service of the SS and the Nazi Party, where the ''Sicherheitspolizei'' (SiPo; Security Police) was a term used in Nazi Germany to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kripo (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. Thereafter, they became departments of the [[RSHA]]). On 11 October 1941, he was appointed ''Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienst'' in [[Trondheim]]. As ''Kommandeur'' of the district, he was also chief of [[Falstad concentration camp]] outside Trondheim and the prisons in Trondheim. He was promoted to the rank of ''Obersturmbannführer''  (lieutenant colonel) and received the title of ''Oberregierungsrat''. His immediate superior was [[Heinrich Fehlis]]. On 8 May 1945, he fled from Trondheim with a gold bar in his luggage. He was caught and sent back with a police escort on the train and during which he made an unsuccessful attempt to escape.
&lt;ref&gt;The German Occupation of Norway, by Paul Gerhardt Vigness, pp. 149, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known for being a notorious torturer, and ordered the execution of many members of the [[Norwegian resistance movement]] without any trial. After World War II, in 1946, he was tried and sentenced, for the many cases of torture and murder, to [[execution by firing squad]]. The sentence was carried out at midnight at [[Kristiansten festning]] on 28 February 1948. Right before the order was given to fire, Gerhard Flesch shouted loudly &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;.

'''Gerhard Klopfer''' (18 February 1905 – 29 January 1987) was an official of the [[Nazi Party]] and assistant to [[Martin Bormann]] in the Office of the (Nazi) [[Party Chancellery]].

Klopfer was born in [[Pisarzowice, Lubań County|Schreibersdorf]], [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]] (now in [[Poland]]), in 1905. He studied law and economics and in 1931 became a judge in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany. When the [[Machtergreifung|Nazis came to power]] in 1933, he joined the [[Nazi Party]] and the SA ([[Sturmabteilung]]) along with the [[Gestapo]] (Secret State Police) the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehrer2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Steven|last1=Lehrer|title=Wannsee House and the Holocaust|url={{Google books|bn8wCgAAQBAJ|page=161|plainurl=yes}}|date=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4092-4|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he became a member of [[Rudolf Hess]]'s staff and the SS ([[Schutzstaffel]]) with the honorary [[SS rank]] of [[Oberführer]] (Senior Colonel). In 1938, he became responsible for the seizing of Jewish businesses, for questions about [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriages]] between Gentile and Jewish Germans, and general questions about occupation of foreign states.

As State Secretary of the Parteikanzlerei (Party Chancellery), Klopfer represented Bormann, who was head of the Parteikanzlei, at the [[Wannsee Conference]] on 20 January 1942 in which the details of the &quot;[[Final Solution of the Jewish Question]]&quot; were formalised, policies that culminated in the [[Holocaust]]. Along with [[Helmuth Friedrichs]], Klopfer was the highest-ranking bureaucrat behind Bormann in the Chancellery. This position gave him extensive power of patronage within the Nazi Party as Bormann often left appointments to party positions to Klopfer and Friedrichs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orlow|first=Dietrich|title=The History of Nazi Party: 1933-1945 - Volume 2|year=1969|page=426|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this position he was also responsible as signatory for the concept of final call to arms of the underaged and elders in the age range of 16 – 60 years &quot;Volkssturm&quot; in the final stage of the war.

In 1944, he was promoted to SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]''.

As the [[Red Army]] closed in on [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]] in 1945, Klopfer fled the city. He was captured and imprisoned and was charged with [[war crime]]s but was released for lack of evidence. He became a tax advisor in the city of [[Ulm]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]]) in 1952 and retrieved his Admission to the Bar in 1956 in order to practice as a lawyer. He was the last surviving attendee of the Wannsee Conference, dying in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/02/05/gerhard-klopfer-met-for-final-solution-dies/10ae2164-c73a-4683-92e6-b116228bf490/ |title=GERHARD KLOPFER, MET FOR 'FINAL SOLUTION,' DIES |date=5 February 1987 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/05/obituaries/gerhard-klopfer-general-in-th-ss.html |title=GERHARD KLOPFER, GENERAL IN THE SS |date=5 February 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klopfer was portrayed by [[Ian McNeice]] in the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]/[[Home Box Office|HBO]] made-for-cable film ''[[Conspiracy (2001 film)|Conspiracy]]'' in  2001.

'''Gerhard Palitzsch''' (July 17, 1913 – December 7, 1944), was a [[Germans|German]] [[Schutzstaffeln|SS]] [[non-commissioned officer]], notorious for his activities in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].
[[File:Gerhard Palitzsch.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gerhard Palitzach as a SS Hauptscharfuhrer]]
At the beginning of his career as NCO, Palitzsch served as a sentry in the concentration camps of [[Lichtenburg (concentration camp)|Lichtenburg]], [[Buchenwald]], and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], where he was ''Blockführer'' (head of a prisoners’ barrack). From Sachsenhausen he was transferred to [[Auschwitz]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;People in Auschwitz, by Hermann Langbein. Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press; illustrated edition (December 4, 2003) Language: English. ISBN 0-8078-2816-5,
ISBN 978-0-8078-2816-8&lt;/ref&gt;

He brought with him 30 prisoners from Sachsenhausen who were to take over posts as ''[[Prisoner functionary|Funktionshäftlinge]]'' (prisoners with special functions). Palitzsch was the first ''Rapportführer'' and in this position he practised extensive terror. Moreover, he very often took part in the executions at the black wall. Palitzsch claimed to a fellow SS member, that he was responsible for shooting some 25,000 people in the back of the head. Like other concentration camp personnel he enriched himself by stealing the property robbed from the victims and because of this he was a subject of SS investigations into [[Political corruption|theft and corruption]]. His transfer in 1943 to a sub-camp at [[Brünn|Brünn, The Czech Republic]], where he was made the Commandant, may have been a penal transfer.

Some prisoners in more trusted jobs in Auschwitz fought back against the camp, one of the means of attack was to breed lice infected with Typhus in the camp infirmary and then put these lice into clothes given to SS personnel. Because of his notoriety, Palitzsch was given such an item, although he did not get typhus, his wife Luise died from it. After that, he was believed to have started sexual relations with a female prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Fighting Auschwitz by Josef Garlinski, publisher Fontana, ISBN 978-0-00-634008-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his transfer to [[Brünn]] he was arrested, sent back to Auschwitz, and interred in the prison in Block 11. Accused of ''“Race Defilement”'', i.e. sexual relations with &quot;non-Aryans&quot; and theft, Palitzsch was sentenced to death, but reprieved and instead sent to a penal unit. In June 1944, he was thrown out of the SS. His later fate is unknown; he is said to have fallen during the [[battle of Budapest]].

In a letter from the resistance movement, smuggled out of Auschwitz, he was described as “the greatest bastard of Auschwitz”.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} His colleague, [[Perry Broad]], wrote about him in his report that “he enjoyed taking part in the mass executions”.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Rudolf Höss]], who was not hesitant in his criticism of his staff, wrote in his memoirs: “Palitzsch was the most cunning and sly creature I ever got to know during my long, many-sided duty in the various concentration camps. He literally climbed over dead bodies in order to satisfy his lust for power.”&lt;ref&gt;page 409 of People in Auschwitz, by Hermann Langbein.

'''Gerhard Arthur Puff''' (c. 1914 - August 21, 1954) was an [[United States|American]] [[gangster]], executed by the [[US Federal Government|federal authorities]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] for killing a federal agent. A native of [[Dresden|Dresden, Germany]], on June 6, 1927, the thirteen-year-old Puff, along with his mother and five-year-old brother arrived at [[Ellis Island]] on board {{SS|Columbus|1924|6}} from [[Bremen]].&lt;ref&gt; Ancestry.com.

In 1952, he traveled from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] to [[Manhattan]] with his  17-year-old wife, Annie Laurie. By this time, his career as a bank robber had earned him a spot on the [[FBI]]'s [[Ten Most Wanted List]]. Shortly after he arrived at the [[Congress Hotel]], FBI agents waited to arrest him.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0504,gonnerman,60415,5.html/1 &quot;The Last Executioner&quot; by Jennifer Gonnerman], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt; He did not remain at Room 904 but returned to the first floor in a few minutes by the stairway where FBI Special Agent Joseph John Brock, aged 44, was stationed. Puff encountered Agent Brock and shot him twice in the chest and took the collapsing officer's gun. Then, with a gun in each hand, Puff zig-zagged through the hotel's lobby, firing another shot at converging agents. Agents outside the hotel called on Puff to surrender but he responded with bullets. Puff was shot and collapsed on the street. He was taken to a hospital for treatment, then to the prison ward at Bellevue. Brock was treated by a doctor on the scene, then rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.

On May 15, 1953, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Gerhard Arthur Puff was found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. Puff's attorney appealed the conviction but to no avail and on August 12, 1954, at Sing Sing Prison, Ossining in the [[electric chair]] and declared dead at 11:08 p.m. Puff was one of the first people New York [[State Electrician]] [[Dow Hover]] was hired to execute.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; The execution was the fifth federal execution since [[US President|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] took office on January 20, 1953.

[[Image:Gerhard Rose during the Doctors Trial.jpg|thumb|Gerhard Rose testifies in his own defense at the [[Doctors' Trial]] in [[Nuremberg]] in 1947]]
'''Gerhard August Heinrich Rose''' (November 30, 1896 in Danzig – January 13, 1992 in [[Obernkirchen]]) was a [[Germany|German]] expert on [[tropical medicine]] who was tried for [[war crime]]s at the end of [[World War II]].

==Early life==
Rose was born in [[Danzig]] (then part of [[Province of West Prussia|West Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[German Empire|Germany]], now [[Gdańsk]] [[Poland]]).  Rose attended high schools in [[Szczecin]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Bremen]] and [[Wroclaw]]. After graduation, he started to study medicine at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy for military medical education in [[Berlin]]. In 1914, he was active in the Pépinière Corps Saxonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCL&quot;&gt;[[Kösener Corpslisten]] 1960, '''63''', 189; '''60''', 545; '''40''', 1096&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Berlin and to the Silesian Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Wroclaw .&lt;ref&gt;biographische Angaben zu Rose bei: Dörner, ''Ärzteprozeß'', S. 136 (Erschließungsband), S. 8/03112ff. (Gnadengesuch vom 2. November 1953) S. 8/03174ff. (Urteil der Bundesdisziplinarkammer VII vom 24. Oktober 1960 (Az. VII VI 8/60)). [[Ernst Klee]]: ''Auschwitz, die NS-Medizin und ihre Opfer.'' 3. Auflage, S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1997, ISBN 3-10-039306-6, S. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Rose insisted the medical state examination on 15 November 1921 with the mark &quot; very good &quot;, doctorated on November 20, 1922 with the grade&quot; Magna cum laude &quot;and received the approbation as a doctor on 16 May 1922. Roses training was therefore interrupted from 1914 to 1918 by participating in the First World War.  In 1923 he  became a member of the  Corps Franconia Hamburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCL&quot;/&gt;
In the period 1922-1926 Rose was as a medical assistant at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, at the Hygienic Institute in [[Basel]] and at the Anatomical Institute of the University of [[Freiburg]].

==China==
1929 Rose left Germany for work in [[China]]. He was a medical adviser for the [[Kuomintang]]-government. In December 1929 he was appointed director of the medical  office in [[Zhejiang|Chekiang]], furthermore he was advisor for health at the ministry of the interior in Chekiang. His time in China was interrupted from studies in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. On 1 November 1930 Rose joined the [[Nazi Party]] (Member number: 346.161).&lt;ref&gt;Dörner, ''Ärzteprozess''; S. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return from China==

Prior to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] Rose returned in September 1936 and took over on 1 October, the head of the Department of Tropical Medicine at the Berlin Robert Koch Institute. From summer semester 1938 Rose held at Berlin University lectures and exercises to tropical hygiene and tropical medicine. On February 1, 1943 Rose was named vice president of the Robert Koch Institute.

1939 Rose entered the service of the medical service of the [[Luftwaffe]]. In 1942, he was appointed advisory hygienists and tropical medicine at the medical service of the Luftwaffe. When the war ended, Rose held the rank of a General physician.

==Malaria-experiments==
Roses proceeder as Head of Department at Robert-Koch-Institut was [[Claus Schilling]]. Rose continued the [[Malaria]]-experiments of Schilling, mostly with psychiatry patients.&lt;ref&gt;Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 116 f., 126 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian psychiatrist [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]] succeeded in 1917, to gain success with malaria  against [[General paresis of the insane]]. This malaria therapy was also used by Rose for [[Schizophrenia]]. 
The experiments were made in the concentrations camps in [[Dachau]] and [[Buchenwald]] and with mentally ill Russian prisoners in a psychiatric clinic in [[Thuringia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11234332 | volume=42 | title=Malaria and World War II: German malaria experiments 1939-45 | year=2000 | journal=Parassitologia | pages=53–8 | last1 = Eckart | first1 = WU | last2 = Vondra | first2 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1941 and 1942 Rose tested  for [[IG Farben]] industry, (Leverkusen), new antimalarials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dörner, Ärzteprozess, S. 136&quot;&gt;Dörner, ''Ärzteprozess'', S. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  Malaria experiments with the participation of Rose are documented for the Saxon country-sanatorium [[Arnsdorf]]. By July 1942 altogether 110 patients  were infected by mosquito bites.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Zu Arnsdorf und den genannten Zahlen siehe Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 127 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In a first test series with 49 people, four people died. The experiments in Arnsdorf fell in the time of Nazi medical murders, the [[Aktion T4]]. Subjects were transferred to other institutions and killed there. According to the company &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Rose sought one of the main organizers of the action T4, [[Viktor Brack]], and reached its promise, that subjects were excluded from the transfers.

Rose stood still in conjunction with his predecessor Claus Schilling. From January 1942 human experiments were conducted in [[Dachau concentration camp]] to develop a vaccine against malaria &lt;ref&gt;beispielhaft: ''Schreiben von Claus Schilling an Gerhard Rose vom 4. April 1942'' beim [http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/pflip.php?caseid=HLSL_NMT01&amp;docnum=2293&amp;numpages=1&amp;startpage=1&amp;title=Letter+to+Gerhard+Rose+concerning+mosquitoes+used+in+the+malaria+experiments.&amp;color_setting=C Nuremberg Trials Project] (Nürnberger Dokument NO-1752).

== Typhus vaccine trials in concentration camps ==
The [[ghetto]] isolation of the Jews and the states in the [[POW camp]] led in the German-occupied territories in the East to the outbreak of [[typhus]] epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 287 f.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the main disseminator of typhus in the [[General Government]] were blamed &quot;originating from the Jewish quarter of Warsaw vagabond Jews&quot;. [[Rudolf Wohlrab]] met with Rose in Warsaw &lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Wohlrab: ''Flecktyphusbekämpfung im Generalgouvernement.'' Münchner Medizinische Wochenzeitschrift, 29. Mai 1942 (Nr. 22) S. 483 ff. Zitiert nach: Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  By Wehrmacht tourists and the to German Reich deported [[forced labor in the era of National socialism|forced laborers]], the disease spread in the autumn of 1941, also in the Reich. In December 1941, on the search for a suitable vaccine several meetings between representatives of the Armed Forces, of manufacturers and representatives of the authorities responsible for health issues [[Ministry of the Interior|Reich Interior Ministry]] were held. Since the vaccines from several manufacturers were new and templates any experiences about their protection, human experiments in [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] were agreed. The experiments were under control of [[Joachim Mrugowsky]] from the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen SS. In Buchenwald [[Erwin Ding-Schuler]] was the experimenter.

On March 17, 1942, Rose attended together with Eugen Gildemeister the experimental tation at Buchenwald. At this time, 150 prisoners had been infected with typhus, with 148 of them the disease was found.&lt;ref&gt;Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 292. Der Eintrag im Tagebuch der Versuchsstation beim [http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/pflip.php?caseid=HLSL_NMT01&amp;docnum=1547&amp;numpages=27&amp;startpage=3&amp;title=Tagebuch+der+Abteilung+fuer+Fleckfieber-+u.+Virusforschung+am+Hygiene-Institut+der+Waffen-SS..&amp;color_setting=C Nuremberg Trials Project] (Nürnberger Dokument NO-265, S. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 3rd session of the Consultative Medical Wehrmacht Ding-Schuler held in May 1943 a lecture entitled '' On the results of the examination of different spotted fever vaccines against the classical typhus '', in which he - the attempts camouflaging - whose results lectured &lt;ref&gt;Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 126; Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 310 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Rose, participant in the meeting and advised of the nature of the human experiments, brought before the meeting objected to the nature of the human trials. According to later information of those who were present, it was whispered quietly [...]among the participants of the meeting &quot;that this could have been concentration camp experiments.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;Eidesstattliche Erklärung Walter Schells vom 1. März 1947, zitiert nach: Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 126. Die Erklärung Schells in englischer Übersetzung beim [http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/pflip.php?caseid=HLSL_NMT01&amp;docnum=885&amp;numpages=5&amp;startpage=1&amp;title=Affidavit.&amp;color_setting=C Nuremberg Trials Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
The opposition of Rose was later confirmed independent from the conference participants by [[Eugen Kogon]]. Kogon was an inmate of Ding-Schuler, who repeatedly made known his displeasure with the intervention of Rose in Buchenwald.&lt;ref&gt;Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his protests in May 1943, Rose turned on 2 December 1943, to Joachim Mrugowsky from the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen SS with the request, to perform in the Buchenwald concentration camp further series of tests with a new [[typhus vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 129. Siehe auch Nürnberger Dokument NO-1186.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enno Lolling]], head of Office D III (sanitation and camp Hygiene) in SS Economic and administrative main Office, approved on February 14, 1944, the series of experiments, &quot;suitable 30 [[Porajmos|gypsies]]&quot;  should be transferred to Buchenwald. The tests were made between March and June 1944. Six of the 26 infected prisoners died.&lt;ref&gt;Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 130 f. bezugnehmend auf das Buchenwalder Tagebuch, S. 23 (Nürnberger Dokument NO-265)&lt;/ref&gt;

Haagen complained on October 4, 1943 in writing to Rose that the appropriate prisoners were missing to carry out infection experiments on vaccinated persons.&lt;ref&gt;''Schreiben Eugen Hagen an Gerhard Rose vom 4. Oktober 1943'' (Nürnberger Dokument NO-2874), siehe Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 158 f.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November 1943, the SS office sent 100 prisoners to Haagen.
In early 1944, the Institute of  Hygiene of the Luftwaffe led by Rose was settled into the sanatory Pfafferode near Mulhouse (Thuringia).&lt;ref&gt;Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 130ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the institution Pfafferode, led by Theodor Steinmeyer, were at that time patients in the second phase of the Nazi medical murders of action Brandt murdered by food deprivation and the overdose of drugs.

==Defendant in the physician process==

When the war ended Rose was on May 8, 1945 captured by Allied troops. Evidence suggesting the involvement of doctors from the Lufwaffe to the human experiments in concentration camps resulted from the Nuremberg Trials of the main war criminals.&lt;ref name=&quot;aerzteblatt.de&quot;&gt;Udo Benzenhöfer: ''Nürnberger Ärzteprozeß: Die Auswahl der Angeklagten.'' [http://www.aerzteblatt.de/pdf/93/45/a2929_31.pdf Deutsches Ärzteblatt 1996; 93: A-2929–2931 (Heft 45)] (pdf-Datei, 258KB)&lt;/ref&gt; Accused was also Hermann Göring. According to the medical historian Udo Benzenhöfer allied investigations about the people involved  led to the higher-ranked and highest-ranking defendants.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aerzteblatt.de&quot;/&gt; before. Rose was just one of seven other accused doctors of the Luftwaffee in the physician process. Central to the case against Rose were typhus experiments in the concentration camps Buchenwald and Natzweiler.&lt;ref name=&quot;aerzteblatt.de&quot;/&gt;]  During the process, Rose was also accused of having supported the malaria experiments of Claus Schilling in Dachau.
Of the other defendants differed Rose by his intellectual nature and his extensive medical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Diese Einschätzung bei Ulf Schmidt: ''Justice at Nuremberg. Leo Alexander and the Nazi Doctors' Trial.'' palgrave macmillan, Houndmills 2004, ISBN 0-333-92147-X, S. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his international experience he drew in his testimony between 18 and 25 April 1947 numerous comparisons between the tests in the German concentration camps and experiments that foreign researchers had carried out on humans.&lt;ref&gt;Auszüge aus Roses Aussagen bei: Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 120-124, 131-132, 134-147. Siehe auch Schmidt, ''Justice'', S. 226 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He had assumed that the experiments in the Buchenwald concentration camp &quot;should be carried out to criminals sentenced to death.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Verhandlungsprotokoll'', S. 6231 ff., zitiert nach Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; This was contradicted by the charged as a witness in Nuremberg former inmate Eugen Kogon (1903-1987): After one or two trials it became impossible to find volunteers in Buchenwald.  He was not a single case in which a death sentence was passed.&lt;ref&gt;''Verhandlungsprotokoll'', S. 1197, zitiert nach Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; During the interrogation the prosecution put forward as evidence Roses letter to [[Joachim Mrugowsky]] of 2 December 1943.  Rose then compared himself to a lawyer, who was opponent of the death penalty and insets in the art and to the Government for their elimination: &quot;If he does not succeed, it will remain as still in the profession and in its surroundings there, and he can even be may be forced to utter such a death sentence even though he basically is an opponent of this institution.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Verhandlungsprotokoll'', S. 6568, zitiert nach Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison and campaign to free==
On 31 January 1951, the penalty was reduced to fifteen years in prison by the American High Commissioner [[John J. McCloy]]. The pressure was his bitterness strengthened against his former superiors. “&lt;ref&gt;''Formular „Führung in der Anstalt“'', 9. November 1953, in: Dörner, ''Ärzteprozess'', S. 8/03125 f.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June 1953 Rose was the last of the in the doctors' trial to imprisonment condemned physicians to be dismissed from [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]] prison.

Rose's detention was accompanied by various efforts to his early release by Rose's wife and Ernst Georg Nauck, Director of Hamburger [[Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine|Bernhard Nocht Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;siehe Dörner, ''Ärzteprozess'', S. 8/03094 ff. Ernst Georg Nauck hatte zuvor vier Erklärungen an Eides statt für Roses Verteidigung beigesteuert. Die Erklärung in englischer Übersetzung beim [http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/search.php?DI=1&amp;FieldFlag=1&amp;PAuthors=549 Nuremberg Trials Project]. Zu den Bemühungen um Roses Freilassung siehe auch: Angelika Ebbinghaus: ''Blicke auf den Nürnberger Ärzteprozeß.'' In: Dörner, ''Ärzteprozeß'', (Erschließungsband), S. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; on September 29, 1950 the Free Association of German Hygienists and microbiologists contacted John J. McCloy with a request for Roses release: His large professional experience and previous performance to be expected, &quot;that he will give the science and humanity many valuable benefits when used as a last, after more five and a half year prison his profession and his work is returned &quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Petition anlässlich der Tagung der Freien Vereinigung deutscher Hygieniker und Mikrobiologen in Hamburg am 29. September 1950.'' In: Dörner, ''Ärzteprozeß'', S. 8/03104.&lt;/ref&gt; In the weekly Hamburg newspaper ''[[Die Zeit]]'' an article was published with the heading ''Zu Unrecht in Landsberg. Ein Wort für den Forscher und Arzt Gerhard Rose''. (Wrongly in Landsberg. A word for the doctor and researcher Gerhard Rose).The article was written by [[Josef Müller-Marein|Jan Molitor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Die Zeit,'' 18. März 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

A clemency petition of 2 November 1953 launched Rose in addition to his arguments in the Doctors' Trial order. The actually responsible for the typhus experiments have not been held accountable and are partly now being transferred to the US government service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blicke66&quot;&gt;Ebbinghaus, ''Blicke'', S. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disciplinary proceedings==
After being released, Rose carried on his rehabilitation.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blicke66&quot; /&gt; As a so-called &quot;131er&quot; could also officials who had worked for the National Socialist state, are admitted within the Federal Republic of Germany as civil servants. Because of a [[Malfeasance in office]]  disciplinary proceedings were initiaded in May 1956 against Rose. on October 24, 1960 acquitted him the Federal Disciplinary Body VII in Hamburg for free.&lt;ref&gt;''Urteil der Bundesdisziplinarkammer VII vom 24. Oktober 1960 (Az. VII VI 8/60).'' In: Dörner, ''Ärzteprozeß'', S. 8/03173-8/03205.&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses at the court  were Rudolf Wohlrab who had taken human experiments to typhus in 1940 in Warsaw and was in contact at this time with Rose, and Ernst Georg Nauck, who had been engaged for Rose.&lt;ref&gt;''Urteil der Bundesdisziplinarkammer VII vom 24. Oktober 1960 (Az. VII VI 8/60).'' In: Dörner, ''Ärzteprozeß'', S. 8/03199. Zu Wohlrab siehe Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945.'' Fischer Taschenbuch, Frankfurt am Main 2005, ISBN 3-596-16048-0, S. 684 und Mitscherlich, ''Medizin'', S. 146. Zu Nauck siehe Klee, ''Personenlexikon'', S. 428, und Klee, ''Auschwitz'', S. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
The negotiation of the court caused criticism by [[Alexander Mitscherlich (psychologist)|Alexander Mitscherlich]].  Mitscherlich was heard on 21 October 1960 as a witness because he had issued the document collection '' Science without humanity '' about the physician process.
According to Mitscherlich the document collection was not in the files of the court.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
'''Gerhard Wagner''' (18 August 1888 in [[Chorzów|Neu-Heiduk]], [[Silesia Province|Prussian Silesia]], now in Poland – 25 March 1939 in [[Munich]]) was the first Reich Doctors' Leader (''Reichsärzteführer'') in the time of [[Nazi Germany]].

Born a [[surgery]] [[professor]]'s son, he studied [[medicine]] in Munich and served as a doctor at the front in World War I (1914–1918). Among other things, he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]], first class.

From 1919, Wagner ran his own medical practice in Munich, while also being a member of two ''[[Freikorps]]'' between 1921 and 1923, ''von Epp'' and ''Oberland''. Just because of his [[Silesia]]n origins, Wagner stayed on as leader of the Upper Silesia German Community Associations (''Deutschtumsverbände Oberschlesiens'')&lt;!---&quot;Deutschtum&quot; is hard to translate. A less awkward wording would be nice.---&gt;. In May 1929, he switched to the [[NSDAP]].

Dr. Wagner was co-founder and as of 1932 leader of the National Socialist German Physicians' Federation (NSDÄB), and also functioned from 1933 as a member of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] ''[[Landtag]]''. A year later, in 1934, Wagner was ordered to the position of Reich Doctors' Leader. Moreover, he was &quot;The Führer's Commissioner for National Health&quot;. By 1933, he had already become leader of the Main Office for National Health, and in 1936 came his appointment as that office's Main Service Leader (''Hauptdienstleiter'').

In December 1935, Wagner became leader of the ''Reichsärztekammer'' (Physicians' Chamber).  At the 1936 Nuremberg Rally, he discussed the racial laws. As was typical of Nazi propaganda at this time, this was more in terms of the pure and growing race than the evil of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/pt36rasse.htm Race and Population Policy]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  A shift in his political career came in 1937 when he was promoted to [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] [[Obergruppenführer]]. Meanwhile, he was also commissioner for collegiate issues on [[Rudolf Hess]]'s staff.

Wagner died quite young, at only 50. The cause of his sudden death is to this day unknown. His successor was [[Leonardo Conti]].

Gerhard Wagner was jointly responsible for [[euthanasia]] and [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] carried out against [[Jew]]s and the [[Disability|handicapped]], and showed himself at the Nuremberg Party Congress in 1935 to be a staunch proponent of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], and thereby also of [[Nazi Germany]]'s race legislation and racial politics. Under Wagner's leadership, the Nazi killing institution at [[Hadamar Clinic|Hadamar]] was established.

Lindsay is believed to have hired one of the cars left at [[Luton]] railway station on 7 July before the bombers made their rail journey to [[London]].

'''''Germany, Year Zero''''' ({{lang-it|'''Germania anno zero'''}}) is a 1948 film directed by [[Roberto Rossellini]], and is the final film in Rossellini's unofficial war film trilogy, following ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' and ''[[Paisà]]''. ''Germany Year Zero'' takes place in post-war [[Germany]], unlike the others, which take place in German-occupied Rome and during the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], respectively. 

As in many [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] films, Rossellini used mainly local, non-professional actors. He filmed on locations in [[Berlin]] and intended to convey the reality in Germany the year after its near total destruction in [[World War II]]. It contains dramatic images of bombed out Berlin and of the human struggle for survival following the destruction of the [[Third Reich]]. When explaining his ideas about realism in an interview, he said, &quot;realism is nothing other than the artistic form of truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Tag|title=NR = MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: Rossellini, &quot;Neo-Realism,&quot; and Croce|journal=Film History|date=Winter 1988|volume=2|issue=1|pages=87–97|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Twelve-year-old Edmund Kohler lives in devastated, post-World War II Berlin with his ailing, bedridden father and his adult siblings, Eva and Karl-Heinz. Eva manages to obtain cigarettes by going out with soldiers of the Allied forces, but she resists her friends' advice to prostitute herself. Karl-Heinz is the older son who fought in the war and is a burden to the struggling family, refusing to register with the police and get a ration card because he is afraid of what would happen if they found out he fought to the bitter end. The Kohlers and others have been assigned to the apartment home of the Rademachers by the housing authority, much to Mr. Rademacher's irritation.

Edmund does what he can for his family, trying to find work and selling a scale for Mr. Rademacher on the [[black market]]. By chance, Edmund meets Herr Henning, his former school teacher, who still remains a Nazi at heart. Henning, who exhibits what may be interpreted as a [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] interest in Edmund, gives him a recording of Hitler to sell to the occupying soldiers, entrusting him to the more experienced Jo and Christl. Henning gives Edmund 10 marks for his work. Afterward, Edmund tags along as the young man Jo steals 40 marks from a woman by pretending to sell her a bar of soap. Jo gives Edmund some of his stolen potatoes and leaves the inexperienced boy with Christl, whom another member of their gang describes as a mattress that dispenses cigarettes.

After Mr. Kohler takes a turn for the worse, Henning tells Edmund that life is cruel and that the weak should be sacrificed so that the strong can survive. A kindly doctor manages to get Mr. Kohler admitted to a hospital, where he receives much more plentiful and healthy food. This temporarily relieves some of the pressure on his family. When Edmund goes to see his father, the old man bemoans his misery. He tells his son that he has considered suicide but lacks the courage to carry it out. He says that he is a burden and that it would be better if he were dead. Edmund steals some poison while no one is looking.

A few days later, the father is discharged and returns home. Edmund poisons his tea just before police raid the apartment and Karl-Heinz finally turns himself in. The father dies while his elder son is in custody. Everyone assumes the death is due to malnutrition and sickness. When Karl-Heinz returns, he is crushed by the news.

A disturbed Edmund wanders the city. He turns first to Christl, but she is busy with young men and has no time for or interest in a youngster. He goes to Henning and confesses that he did as the schoolteacher had suggested, murdering his father, but Henning protests that he never told the boy to kill anyone. When Edmund tries to join younger children in a street game of football, they reject him. He ascends the ruins of a bombed out building, and watches from a hole in the wall as they take his father's coffin away across the street. Finally, after hearing his sister call for him, he jumps from the building to his death.

ISBN 0-306-80873-0. p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Rossellini then returned to Rome and secured funding for the film from the French company Union Générale Cinématographique and his friends [[Salvo D'Angelo]] and Alfredo Guarini. He also got equipment and crew members from the German company Sadfi.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Rossellini then returned to Berlin in July 1947 to continue research for the film and select a suitable cast.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time director [[Billy Wilder]] was in Berlin shooting ''[[A Foreign Affair]]'', and Wilder even satirized Rossellini's film with a character that resembles Edmund. Wilder later said he regretted satirizing Rossellini in his own film, when he had tried to emulate and copy his style. &lt;ref&gt;Gallagher&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
As was his usual custom, Rossellini cast the film with non-professionals that he met on the street. Rossellini found Ernst Pittschau sitting on the front steps of a retirement home and discovered that he had been a silent film actor forty years earlier. He saw former ballet dancer Ingetraud Hinze standing in a food line and was struck with the look of despair on her face. Franz-Otto Krüger came from a family of academics and had been imprisoned by the [[Gestapo]] during the war. Other smaller parts were cast with such people as a former [[Wehrmacht]] general, an ex-wrestler, a literature and art history professor, a model and a group of children that were bored of living on the streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher. p. 240&quot;&gt;Gallagher. p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the lead role of Edmund, Rossellini wanted to find a young German boy who physically resembled his recently deceased son Romano Rossellini. After auditioning several young boys, Rossellini went to a performance of the Barlay circus one night to see the elephants. There he saw an eleven-year-old acrobat named Edmund Meschke and immediately asked Meschke to audition for him. Rossellini combed Meschke's hair to resemble his son and, amazed at the physical resemblance, immediately cast him in the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The finished film began with the title &quot;This film is dedicated to the memory of my son Romano. — Roberto Rossellini&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Shooting began on 15 August 1947 with no formal script and Rossellini instructing the actors to improvise their dialogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher. p. 240&quot;/&gt; Rossellini directed the film in French and had to depend on Max Colpet to translate for him throughout shooting. While filming on location in the streets of Berlin, Rossellini was amazed by the indifference to a film crew from people on the streets who were far too preoccupied with attempting to get food and survive.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When Rossellini went to Rome for a week in the middle of shooting to spend time with his then mistress [[Anna Magnani]], [[Carlo Lizzani]] directed some scenes in his absence. In mid-September location shooting in Berlin wrapped after 40 days and the production moved to Rome on 26 September 1947 to film the interior scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the German actors arrived in Rome they had to wait until November to resume filming because the film's sets had not been built. By November the previously malnourished Germans had gained a noticeable amount of weight while in Rome and had to be put on crash diets so as to retain continuity with their earlier scenes. After filming in Rome was complete most of the German actors didn't want to go back to Berlin and a few ran away to the Italian countryside. The film's final budget was $115,000.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
This film was in many ways vastly different from Rossellini's previous neorealism films, in that it was mostly shot in a studio and used rear screen projections for the Berlin scenes. Many critics who had previously championed Rossellini condemned the film for being melodramatic and disappointingly unrealistic. Rossellini stated that he wanted to &quot;tell a story of a child, of an innocent creature which a distorted 'utopian' education induced to commit murder in the belief that he was performing a heroic gesture. But a feeble light of morality is not yet extinguished in him; driven by those small gleams of conscious, confused, he commits suicide.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman, John 1987. p. 962&quot;&gt;Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors, Volume 2.'' [[H. W. Wilson Company]]. 1987. p. 962.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Georges Auriol called it hasty and superficial. [[Andre Bazin]] called it &quot;not a movie but a sketch, a rough draft of a work Rossellini hasn't given us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''L'Écran français'' called it revolutionary, and [[Charlie Chaplin]] said it was &quot;the most beautiful Italian film&quot; he had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Rossellini said that &quot;I don't think it's possible to say more bad things about a film than were said about ''Germany Year Zero.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Germans disliked the film's negative and pessimistic attitude. The film was first screened in Germany in 1952 at a brief Munich film club screening and was not seen again until it was shown on German TV in 1978. In 1949 Austrian film critic [[Hans Habe]] called it &quot;a terrifying film...not artistically, but because it would be terrifying if the world saw the new Germany as Rossellini does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in New York in September 1949 and was negatively compared to ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosley Crowther]] said that the film had &quot;a strange emptiness of genuine feeling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to win the [[Golden Leopard]] and the [[Best Direction Award (Locarno International Film Festival)|Best Director]] award at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman, John 1987. p. 962&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Locarno&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pardo.ch/jahia/Jahia/home/Festival/History/Winners-of-the-Golden-Leopard/lang/en |title=Winners of the Golden Leopard |accessdate=2012-08-12 |work=Locarno |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719031720/http://www.pardo.ch/jahia/Jahia/home/Festival/History/Winners-of-the-Golden-Leopard/lang/en |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">'''Gerolamo Olgiati''' (1453 &amp;ndash; January 2, 1477) was a government official in [[Milan]] and one of the assassins of [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]], the [[Duke of Milan]], along with [[Giovanni Andrea Lampugnani]] and [[Carlo Visconti]].

Olgiati was the political radical of the conspiracy, bearing no known grudge against the Duke, but rather acting out of [[Republic]]an ideals.  He claimed in a subsequent confession that many of ideas were the product of studying under [[Cola Montano]] a [[Humanism|Humanist educator]] who had first suggested the assassination.

The Duke, although popular as a patron of the arts, was known to be somewhat of a tyrant in his rule and made many enemies through his reputation as a womaniser.  Olgiati was soon involved in a conspiracy with Lampugnani and Visconti, two older officials who each had more personal reasons to assassinate the Duke.

== Assassin ==

On December 26, 1476, [[St. Stephen's Day]], the three conspirators met at the church of [[Basilica di Santo Stefano Maggiore|St. Stephen (Santo Stefano Maggiore)]], the site where the assassination was to take place. After praying for the saint's protection, the three waited, along with several supporters and the regular congregation, for the Duke's arrival.

The Duke arrived at the church with a customary procession. When it reached the part of the church where the assassins were, Lampugnani struck the first blow, soon joined by Visconti, Olgiati and a servant of Lampugnani's, all of whom were armed and wearing hidden armour.  The Duke died during the attack and everyone - assassins included, quickly fled the church except for Lampugnani who was struck down.

The next day, however, [[Franzone]], the servant of Lampugnani was caught and gave up the identities of the other conspirators.  Olgiati was apprehended on December 30, given up by, amongst others, his own father, who denounced his son as a [[traitor]].  After a summary confession, Olgiati was publicly executed on January 2, 1477 along with Franzone and Visconti.  The bodies of these three men were torn from groin to neck and affixed to the gates of Milan as a warning to others; the heads separated and displayed on lances on the city's belltower.

According to historian and writer [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], Olgiati uttered the famous words, while being tortured, &quot;Mors acerba, fama perpetua, stabit vetus memoria facti&quot; (Death is bitter, but glory is eternal, the memory of my deed will endure).&lt;ref name=&quot;HistFlorence&quot;&gt;[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s [[Florentine Histories]], Book VII Chapter VI&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cornelius Gerhardus van Rooyen''' (''''Gert' &quot;Bokkie&quot; van Rooyen''') was a South African [[paedophile]] and [[serial killer]] (although never convicted) who, together with his female partner Joey Haarhoff, abducted and apparently murdered at least six young girls between 1988 and 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot; /&gt; Their victims were never found as the pair committed suicide when faced with arrest after the escape of their last kidnap victim.

==Criminal history==

Van Rooyen's first crimes were theft, for which he was sent to a reform school in 1954 for stealing a car which was used as transport from [[Cape Town]] to [[Pretoria]] to visit his dying mother, followed by imprisonment in 1960 for stealing motor spares and clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;FearedGod&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/he-feared-god-but-loved-young-girls-1.322079?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot|date=7 April 2007|last=Gallagher|first=Christina|work=[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]|title=Feared God but 'loved' young girls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married and subsequently fathered six children: Anne Marie, Judith, Hannes, Flippie, Gerhard and Adriaan.  He ran a building construction business together with his brothers.

In 1979, Gert van Rooyen abducted two girls aged 10 and 13, taking them to the [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] near [[Pretoria]], where he punched them in the face to force them to strip naked and perform sexual acts.  Van Rooyen released the girls in Pretoria the following day.  He was subsequently arrested and sentenced to four years imprisonment for abduction, sexual assault and common assault of the girls, serving three years before being released.&lt;ref name=&quot;FearedGod&quot;/&gt;

In August 1983, Van Rooyen and his wife Aletta divorced. In 1988, he started dating divorcee Francina Johanna (&quot;Joey&quot;) Hermina Haarhoff.  The couple holidayed together at [[Warmbaths]] and [[Umdloti]], on the [[KwaZulu Natal]] coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;FearedGod&quot;/&gt;

==Possible victims==
[[Image:Gert van Rooyen victims.jpg|||center|Photographs of the missing girls that were circulated by police]]

Van Rooyen was thought to use Haarhoff to lure young girls for him. Children's homes reported that she telephoned requesting to bring girls home for the holidays and weekends. The couple applied to foster children, but the application was turned down.&lt;ref name=&quot;FearedGod&quot;/&gt; At the end of 1989, a 14-year-old girl from an orphanage in the [[Orange Free State]] spent the Christmas holidays with the couple.

* On 1 August 1988, fourteen-year-old Tracy-Lee Scott-Crossley of [[Randburg]] near [[Johannesburg]] disappeared. She was seen by witnesses climbing into a [[VW Beetle]] outside the [[Cresta, Gauteng|Cresta]] shopping mall. A nationwide police search and hypermarket poster campaign were launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://janiallan.com/2017/01/18/finding-tracy/ Face to Face with Noereen Scott-Crossley] ''Sunday Times'' (South Africa). 11 September 1988 &lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, who had declined an offer to go with her, was severely guilt-ridden and traumatised by her disappearance.  In later life he was found guilty of the murder of a farm worker and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scott-Crossley lion-killing trial:Still haunted by the ghost of Gert van Rooyen|last=Hills|first=Carol|publisher=Daily Dispatch|date=12 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 22 December 1988, twelve-year-old Fiona Harvey of [[Pietermaritzburg]] disappeared.  A white [[Ford]] 'Bantam' pick-up used in her abduction with an advertisement for Van Rooyen's building-contracting business on it would later link him to this crime.
* On 7 June 1989, twelve-year-old Joan Horn of [[Pretoria]] disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot; /&gt;
* In July 1989, sixteen-year-old Janet Delport of [[Durban]] disappeared after being abducted in a shopping mall by a blonde woman. She was later found wandering around distressed, but unharmed.
* Some weeks later, nine-year-old Rosa Piel of [[Alberton, Gauteng|Alberton]] disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.security.co.za/fullStory.asp?NewsId=2753|title=Van Rooyen and the missing girls|accessdate=10 August 2008 |date=7 April 2007|work=[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]| author=Michael Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 22 September 1989, eleven-year-old Odette Boucher of [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]] disappeared with twelve-year-old Anne-Mari Wapenaar, also from Kempton Park. They were taken together.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot; /&gt;
* On 29 September 1989, Kobie Wapenaar, Anne-Mari's mother, received a letter from her daughter claiming that she and Odette had run away to Durban with some boys. Odette's letter arrived a week after Anne-Mari's ― although it was posted on the same day, 23 September 1989, in Durban. It is suspected the letter was written under duress.
* On 3 November 1989, Yolanda Wessels, the thirteen-year-old niece of Van Rooyen's partner Joey Haarhoff, disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS&quot; /&gt;
* On 11 January 1990, sixteen-year-old Joan Booysen of [[Pretoria]] was abducted by Haarhoff in [[Church Square, Pretoria]]. She was taken to Van Rooyen's home in Malherbe Street, Capital Park ({{Coord|25|43|43.5|S|28|11|24|E|type:landmark_region:ZA|display=inline}}) where she was handcuffed, drugged and sexually assaulted before being locked in a cupboard. It is likely that Van Rooyen thought the small girl was younger than she was. She managed to escape and alert the police who placed the home under surveillance, and four days later, identified Van Rooyen when he drove past his house in a white Ford pick-up that matched the description of a vehicle used in one of the abductions. Van Rooyen shot Haarhoff with a .22 revolver and himself with a .357 revolver.

All the above disappearances, with the exception of Rosa Piel, were linked by witness statements or [[forensic evidence]] to Van Rooyen and Haarhoff following their deaths.  For example, Odette's Boucher's home address, phone number (that was written on a piece of paper and hidden under a carpet in the garage) and class captain's badge and yellow PT bag as well as Anne-Mari's address and home keys as well as the envelopes and paper that they wrote to their parents were found in his home. None of the Van Rooyen's victims were ever found, despite extensive police searches of his business premises and house (dubbed the &quot;The House of Horrors&quot; by the press).

In 1996, [[Absa Group Limited|Absa Bank]] donated Van Rooyen's former house to the police to allow the girls' disappearance to be investigated further. On 13 May 1996, police systematically demolished the house in a search for new forensic evidence that might provide clues to the girls' fate. The roof was removed and vacuumed for traces of human hair and nails, then the walls demolished and the kitchen and main bedroom scanned with sonar equipment for cavities. The soil in the garden was sifted and some bones found, but [[forensic pathologist]]s identified these as non-human.

In February 2001, Flippie van Rooyen, Gert van Rooyen's &quot;son&quot;, was found guilty of [[perjury]] in the [[Pretoria]] Magistrate's Court. He was charged with three counts of perjury after giving police conflicting statements under oath relating to the six missing schoolgirls. Flippie was then already in jail (a death sentence which had been commuted to life imprisonment) for the murder of a 15-year-old Zimbabwean girl. He was paroled in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paedophile's son on parole&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.iafrica.com/crime/725902.htm|title=Paedophile's son on parole|work=[[iafrica.com]]|date=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, Gerhard, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for theft and fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paedophile's son on parole&quot;/&gt;

On 12 March 2007, renewed interest in the case occurred after a set of adolescent bones was found on the beach near [[Umdloti]], Kwazulu-Natal about 500m away from a holiday resort that Van Rooyen and Haarhoff are known to have visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mom's DNA test of hope|work=The Independent on Sunday|date=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent [[DNA]] testing did not identify any of the Van Rooyen victims.

Significant public attention has been brought to bear on the case recently by the investigative television series, [[Carte Blanche (TV series)|Carte Blanche]] which controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunt for Van Rooyen graves|date=23 October 2007|last=Mboyisa|first=Cederic|work=[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated a recent episode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Fingerprint of Fate|airdate=2007-07-06|series=Carte Blanche|serieslink=Carte Blanche (TV series)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the mystery.

In November 2007, bones were discovered in a property adjacent to Van Rooyen's house in [[Pretoria]] whilst ground was being dug up to install a swimming pool. Local authorities were alerted and police forensic experts were to determine if the bones were human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/New-bones-linked-to-Van-Rooyen-20071114|title=New bones linked to Van Rooyen|publisher=News24|date=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bones give new hope to solving Van Rooyen case; Forensic experts will confirm whether findings are human|author=Barry Bateman and Patrick Hlahla|publisher=The Star|date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heise worked at the camp until January 1944 when she accompanied a transport of women to [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp]] on the outskirts of [[Kraków]]. She remained there until she was assigned to guard the [[death march]] to KZ [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] west, ahead of the Soviet offensive. From there she guarded a prisoner evacuation train in October 1944 to the [[Neuengamme]] concentration camp near [[Hamburg|Hamburg, Germany]].

'''Gesche Margarethe Gottfried''', born Gesche Margarethe Timm (6 March 1785 - 21 April 1831), was a [[serial killer]] who murdered 15 people by [[arsenic]] poisoning in [[Bremen]] and [[Hanover, Germany]], between 1813 and 1827. She was the last person to be publicly executed in the city of Bremen.

== Psychiatric  Profile ==

Gottfried was born into a poor family, she had a twin brother, Johann Timm Junior. Her parents, Johann Timm and Gesche Margarethe Timm, always had a preference for her brother. The reasons behind Gottfried's crimes remain unclear and widely debated, but the emotional deprivation she suffered during her childhood and her modus operandi lead to the assumption, that she suffered from [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], a very common disorder among female serial killers.

Gottfried's victims included her parents, her two husbands, her fiancé and her children. Before being suspected and convicted of the murders, she garnered widespread sympathy among the inhabitants of Bremen because so many of her family and friends fell ill and died. Because of her devoted nursing of the victims during their time of suffering, she was known as the &quot;Angel of Bremen&quot; until her murders were discovered.

== Modus operandi ==

She used a [[rat poison]] called &quot;mouse butter&quot; (in German &quot;Mäusebutter&quot;) very common at the time, which consisted of small flakes [[arsenic]] mixed in animal fat. She mixed small doses into her victims food, eventually they started to get sick and Gottfried &quot;friendly, selfless and resignedly&quot; offered to take care of them during their [[convalescence]], while continuing to poison them.

During the period of her criminal activity, Gesche Gottfried was considered a model citizen and was well liked in the community. Even after the constant loss of relatives who suffered, it seemed that the friendly, candid and kind Gesche chased a &quot;cloud of misfortune&quot;. Her neighbors, moved by the zeal and resignation with caring not only for her family but also her sick friends began to call her &quot;the angel of [[Bremen]]&quot;.

== Gesche Gottfried's victims ==
* 1 October 1813: Johann Miltenberg (first husband)
* 2 May 1815: Gesche Margarethe Timm (mother)
* 10 May 1815: Johanna Gottfried (daughter)
* 18 May 1815: Adelheid Gottfried (daughter)
* 28 June 1815: Johann Timm (father)
* 22 September 1815: Heinrich Gottfried (son)
* 1 June 1816: Johann Timm (brother)
* 5 July 1817: Michael Christoph Gottfried (second husband)
* 1 June 1823: Paul Thomas Zimmermann (fiancé)
* 21 March 1825: Anna Lucia Meyerholz (music teacher and friend)
* 5 December 1825: Johann Mosees (neighbor, friend and advisor)
* 22 December 1826: Wilhelmine Rumpff (landlady)
* 13 May 1827: Elise Schmidt (daughter of Beta Schmidt)
* 15 May 1827: Beta Schmidt (friend, maid)
* 24 July 1827: Friedrich Kleine (friend, creditor; murdered in Hanover)

== Arrest, conviction and execution ==

Johann Christoph Rumpff, Gesche's would be twelfth victim, got suspicious after finding small white granules on food she had prepared for him. He confided to his physician, Dr. Luce, who, incidentally, had already attended several of the earlier victims and handed over the substance he had found. Luce was determined that it was [[arsenic]] and alerted authorities, but by then Gottfried had already claimed two more victims and had moved to [[Hannover]], where she was withering life of her latest victim, Friedrich Kleine.

It was the night of March 6, 1828, the day of her 43rd birthday, when she was arrested. She was sentenced to death by decapitation. She was publicly executed on  April 21, 1831. It was the last public [[execution]] in the history of [[Bremen]] . Gottfried 's deathmask was made to study the facial patterns of criminal women. This is within the [[field of study]] of the now obsolete [[phrenology]] .

{{nihongo|'''''Getsu Fūma Den'''''|月風魔伝||lit. &quot;The Legend of Getsu Fūma&quot;}} is a side-scrolling [[action-adventure game]] for the [[Family Computer]] by [[Konami]], released in 1987 available exclusively in [[Japan]]. While ''Getsu Fūma Den'' never had a sequel, it has been referenced in many subsequent Konami titles throughout the years. The game is structurally similar to ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'' and ''[[The Goonies II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/getsufuu/getsufuu.htm | title = Getsu Fūma Den | first = Kurt | last = Kalata | date = June 12, 2011 | accessdate = July 18, 2016 | publisher = Hardcore Gaming 101 | quote = &quot;The game is structured as a non-linear action-adventure with some light RPG elements, putting it somewhere in the same realm as ''Castlevania II'' and ''The Goonies II''.&quot; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the distant future of 14672 A.D., the first year of the {{nihongo|Demon Age|魔暦元年|Mareki Gan-nen}}, the demon lord {{nihongo|Ryūkotsuki|龍骨鬼}} escaped from hell and plotted to conquer the surface world ruled by the {{nihongo|three Getsu brothers|月氏三兄弟|Getsu-shi San Kyōdai}}. The Getsu brothers fought against Ryūkotsuki, each wielding one of the three spiritual {{nihongo|Pulse Blades|波動剣|Hadōken}} that have been passed within the clan for generations. However, the brothers were ultimately defeated by the demon and only {{nihongo|Fūma|風魔}}, the youngest of the three, survived. Vowing to avenge his slain brothers, Fūma ventures into {{nihongo|Kyōki-tō|狂鬼島|Mad Demon Island}} to recover the three stolen Pulse Blades and summon the spirits of his brothers to defeat Ryūkotsuki.

==Gameplay==
The player controls Fūma, whose goal is to locate the three Pulse Blades that have been stolen from his clan in order to gain access to Ryūkotsuki's lair. Each of the Pulse Blades have been hidden away in the three neighboring islands surrounding Kyōki-tō, which are {{nihongo|''Kigan-tō''|鬼願島||&quot;Ogre Head Island&quot;}}, {{nihongo|''Gokumon-tō''|獄門島||&quot;Prison Gate Island&quot;}}　and {{nihongo|''Mitsukubi-tō''|三首島||&quot;Three Necks Island&quot;}}. Each of these islands requires Fūma to be in possession of a different {{nihongo|Devil Mask|鬼面符|Kimenfu}}.

The game starts off from an overhead view where the player guides Fūma to his next destination. When Fūma enters a gate, the game switches to a side-scrolling action scene where the player must go from one end of the area to the next while fending off enemies and avoiding pitfalls in the usual matter in order to return to the main field and proceed to the next scene. In addition to these action scenes, there are also small shrines featuring villagers who will provide hints to Fūma and shops where he can purchase new items and weapons using the money he has accumulated from defeated enemies. The player switches items by pausing the game during an action sequence and then pressing A to select a defensive item or B to change weapons. Experience points are accumulated by defeating enemies, which will fill out Fūma's sword gauge, increasing the strength of his attacks.

When the player reaches the main dungeon in each of the islands, the game switches to a pseudo-3D perspective which follows Fūma from behind. The player must proceed through a labyrinth in order to reach the boss holding one of the Pulse Swords. Each labyrinth is filled with numerous enemies who will confront Fūma, along with allies who will provide him with hints and helpful items. A candle is required to light these labyrinths, as well as a compass which shows Fūma's current direction. When the player reaches the boss's lair, the game switches back to a side-scrolling perspective before the actual confrontation.

The game uses a lives system like most action games. The player loses a life when he runs out of health or falls into a pitfall. When the player runs out of lives, he can continue from where he left off or quit and resume at a later point using a password. The player is penalized by having his money reduced by half.

'''Geza de Kaplany''' (born June 27, 1926) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[physician]] who emigrated to the [[United States]] in the late 1950s. In 1963, he was convicted of [[first-degree murder]] in [[California]] after [[mutilation|mutilating]] his wife with a [[scalpel]] and [[corrosive substance|corrosive]] [[acid strength|strong acids]], thus causing her death.

==Early life==
De Kaplany was born and raised in Hungary, in a wealthy family. He lost the sight in an eye during a beating by his father, who died in 1938. He studied medicine at the [[University of Szeged]] and graduated with honors in 1951. He went into practice in [[Budapest]] as a [[cardiology|cardiologist]], but clashed with officials in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]],&lt;ref name=SCS19761&gt;{{cite news|title=Nationalist Chinese Officials Didn't Know DeKaplany Was A Murderer Was|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/61210219/|accessdate=28 February 2014|newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=1 March 1976|page=11|quote=De Kaplany is a medical doctor who fled Hungary during the 1956 revolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt; fleeing after it failed.

He appealed his conviction in the California state and [[federal tribunals in the United States|federal]] courts, but the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] ultimately upheld his conviction in a 1976 opinion that issued after de Kaplany had already been granted parole and left the United States.&lt;ref name=ninthcir /&gt;

==Parole==

In 1975, de Kaplany was granted parole in a controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=California Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sb9EAQAAIAAJ|volume=7|year=1976|publisher=California Center for Research and Education in Government|quote=The parole board is under fire for releasing Geza De Kaplany, San Jose physician [..]}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision marked by accusations that postmortem photographs of his victim were removed from his file by Raymond Procunier, the chairman of the California state parole authority for men, prior to review of de Kaplany's case by the parole board. As a result, the ability to be paroled while under the sentence of life imprisonment was removed.{{Disputed inline|date=December 2015}}

Negative public reaction followed, with legislators calling for Procunier's ouster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayarea&quot;/&gt; Procunier resigned the following year, citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Procunier quits week before Senate battle|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18890561/|accessdate=8 December 2015|newspaper=[[Press-Telegram|The Independent]]|location=[[Long Beach, California]]|date=11 June 1976|page=A-6|agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Kaplany worked at the Lutsao clinic for the next four years, and remarried. Tired of constant parole checks, he left Taiwan in late 1979 and dropped out of sight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayarea&quot;/&gt; When California corrections officials discovered he was missing, a warrant was issued for his arrest and his name was submitted to [[Interpol]]. However, a 2002 investigation by the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' indicated that California officials were made aware of de Kaplany's whereabouts several times over the next few years, and once even contacted him to warn him, as required by law, about an anonymous threat on his life, yet failed to take any steps to [[extradition|extradite]] him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayarea&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==

He re-surfaced briefly in [[Munich, Germany]] in December 1980, where a hospital fired him from a staff position after a German women's magazine happened to publish an article on infamous crimes including his case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayarea&quot;/&gt;

For a time in 1983, he worked in the U.S. Army Health Clinic in [[Grafenwöhr]], Bavaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayarea&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, reporters for the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' located the 75-year-old de Kaplany and interviewed him at his home in [[Bad Zwischenahn]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FUGITIVE KILLER'S HAVEN 40 YEARS AFTER SWABBING ACID ON HIS BRIDE OF FIVE WEEKS, AN EX-SAN JOSE DOCTOR LIVES IN GERMANY AS A FREE MAN AND IMMUNE TO DEPORTATION TO COMPLETE HIS SENTENCE|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;p_theme=sj&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields%28Geza%20de%20Kaplany%29%20AND%20date%281/1/2002%20to%201/1/2003%29&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1/1/2002%20to%201/1/2003%29&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22Geza%20de%20Kaplany%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=December 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years prior, he had become a naturalized German citizen, making it impossible to extradite him for the parole violation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayarea&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8456">'''Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka''' (usually shortened to '''Ghazghkull Thraka''') is a fictional character from the table top miniature game ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]''. He featured heavily in the Armageddon campaigns in which he led a huge [[Ork (Warhammer 40,000)|Ork]] horde to try to take the planet. Every campaign in Armageddon also features his nemesis [[Commissar Yarrick]].

==History==
===Early history===
Ghazghkull started off as a common Ork of the [[Ork (Warhammer 40,000)#Goffs|Goff Klan]], on the world of Urk. During a raid, Ghazghkull suffered extensive brain damage from a bolter round to the head. He was tended to by an Ork 'Painboy' known as 'Mad Dok' Grotsnik, who used a bionic device made from [[adamant]]ium to replace Ghazghkull's [[cerebellum]]. Ever since that operation, (although it is unknown if it was because the implant triggered latent [[psychic]] powers, or Ghazghkull was just delusional), Ghazghkull began to claim that he was the recipient of visions from the Ork gods, [[Gork and Mork]].

From this point, Ghazghkull rose through the Ork power structure in an ascent that has been described as &quot;meteoric&quot;. His strength and courage earned him the respect of other Orks. Ghazghkull also possessed something most Orks lacked - vision. His speeches concerned the Orks' mission to conquer the galaxy. He granted the Orks a sense of unity and purpose (as much as these words can be used to describe Orks and their actions).

===The Waaagh!===
At the time Ghazghkull reached the peak of his influence on the world of Urk, the star the world orbited began to show signs of entering the final stages of its life cycle. Ghazghkull claimed that this was a sign from Gork, proclaiming that it was time to launch a great Waaagh!. The Orks of Urk were given a choice: Follow Ghazghkull, or die.

They followed Ghazghkull to an Ork, wanting to claim the galaxy or die in the attempt. The first system to be attacked by the Waaagh! was Armageddon, creating a massive conflict that would come to be known in the [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperium]] as the [[Armageddon (Warhammer 40,000)#Second War for Armageddon|Second War for Armageddon]]. Many chapters of Space Marines, along with the Imperial Guard, were all called on to stop the orks' bloody warpath. Despite initial successes, Ghazghkull was defeated, and retreated from the system.

A notable effect of this invasion resulted in Ghazghkull earning the wrath of [[Commissar Yarrick]], who dedicated his efforts after the Second War to hunting down Ghazghkull, with little success.

===The Third War for Armageddon===
During the fifty seven years following the Second War, Ghazghkull regrouped his forces, and reassessed his strategy. Remembering his defeat at Hades hive 57 years ago, he was not eager to repeat his mistake. That was going to be one of the first places to fall. He led several small attacks on Imperial worlds to test his new methods and technology, and fifty seven years to the day of the previous invasion, he again led the Orks to the Armageddon system.

The campaign waged by both sides was long and bloody, leaving the vital world of Armageddon in a continual state of war.

After the Third War had been fought for a year, Ghazghkull left his forces, leaving the system in a modified [[Space Hulk]] known as Kill Wrecka. He was pursued by High Marshal Helbrecht and an entire Crusade of the [[Black Templars]] Space Marines, along with Commissar Yarrick. Despite a sizeable headstart the faster, more efficient Imperial Navy warships catch the Ork fleet several weeks after leaving Armageddon. 

In a dead region of space known as the Haunted Gulf, Ghazghkull’s ships turn at bay for a last, desperate charge into the teeth of the Imperial Navy’s guns. Even as his fleet is torn apart, Ghazghkull stomps around his bridge bellowing orders. The great Warlord is incandescent with fury, possessed of a vision so powerful that green lightning arcs around him. Their brains overwhelmed by this sudden surge of energy, his entourage of Warpheads convulse as one and begin to howl and gibber madly. As the crackling green energy that haloes Ghazghkull’s skull lashes out to strike the Ork psykers, they are engulfed in green flames, their eyes bursting and skin sizzling. 

With ectoplasmic power gushing from their maws, the Warpheads speak as one, their combined voice the mighty roar of Gork and Mork that Ghazghkull has heard all these months. Every Ork within earshot falls to their knees in awe as the gods tell Ghazghkull that this is not his time to die. They tell him that the whole galaxy must echo with the roar of the Ork. They charge Ghazghkull with gathering a Waaagh! like no other, the Waaagh! of Gork and Mork themselves. To do this, he must defeat every other Warlord, bring every last greenskin under his sway, and unite them all in a crusade that will drown the stars in war. Ghazghkull must unite this Great Waaagh!, and in so doing call forth Gork and Mork to lead the Boyz in a glorious battle that will last forever. Their message delivered, the Weirdboyz explode in ripe showers of wet viscera, and a tide of green power rolls outward from them, frying every system on Ghazghkull’s ship and crippling his pursuers. 

===The Great Waaagh!===
Kill Wrecka is immediately hurled into Warp space, emerging in the midst of the sprawling territory controlled by Ork Warlord Urgok Da Slayer. Ghazghkull is revitalised, red eyes blazing with new purpose. Kill Wrecka makes straight for Urgok’s mighty space fortress. Knowing his only advantage is surprise, Ghazghkull fires up his ship’s tellyporta, transporting himself and a mob of his baddest Nobz in a roaring blast of light, directly into Urgok’s throne room. Urgok looks on in horror as Ghazghkull tears through his bodyguards as though they were rowdy grots. Then,trampling over their mangled corpses with his shoota still smoking, Ghazghkull looms over his cowed rival and ‘invites’ him to join Da Great Waaagh!. Most of Urgok’s Boyz join the Waaagh! willingly, while those too slow to spot which way the wind is howling are quickly beaten into submission. Within weeks, news of Ghazghkull’s new Waaagh! spreads far and wide, the massive Warboss’ legend reaching the ears of Orks hundreds of light years away, sparking the first stirring of an Ork migration on a scale never seen before. With a whole new Waaagh! at his disposal Ghazghkull turns his attentions to the galactic southeast and the empire of Octarius. If the whole galaxy is going to be engulfed in war, Gork and Mork will need a lot more Orks for their Great Waaagh! Besides, Ghazghkull has decided to show the Ork ruler of Octarius what a real Overfiend looks like...

==Special Character History==
Ghazghkull first appeared in [[White Dwarf Magazine]] (issue 134). He was the 'Boss' of Andy Chambers' sample [[Ork (Warhammer 40,000)#Goffs|Goff army list]]; his 'attributes' of an admanatium skull and the ability to call on the Waaagh! were randomly generated. The first Ghazghkull model was an in-house conversion.

Ghazghkull's next appearance was in the ''Battle for Armageddon'' boardgame, based around the events of the [[Armageddon (Warhammer 40,000)#Second War for Armageddon|Second War for Armageddon]], featured opposite [[Commissar Yarrick]]. Inspired by the game's backstory, Jervis Johnson wrote up special rules for the two characters' use in ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' and ''[[Epic 40,000]]'' games, making Ghazghkull one of the first two 'special characters' ever released by Games Workshop. The special rules were based on the random attributes selected by Andy Chambers back at Ghazghkull's first appearance.

Rules for Ghazghkull appeared in the third edition of ''Warhammer 40,000'', and a new model was created for the worldwide campaign organised around the [[Armageddon (Warhammer 40,000)#Third War for Armageddon|Third War for Armageddon]]. The rules were updated to reflect Ghazghkull at a point just prior to the Third War for Armageddon.

'''Gheorghe Pintilie''' (born '''Pantelei Bodnarenko''', also rendered as '''Pintilie Bodnarenco''', 
and nicknamed '''Pantiuşa'''; 1902 &amp;ndash; August 11, 1985) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]  [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|intelligence]] agent, [[Russians|Russian]] citizen and naturalised Romanian communist activist of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;Ion Turcanu, {{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ahEDAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT692&amp;lpg=PT692&amp;dq=Gheorghe+Pintilie+evreu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jf1ElpO22c&amp;sig=JiajLmYWk2nv6QyGAtdDi550q2U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJi5HLgorLAhVB0BoKHZA0ChoQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Gheorghe%20Pintilie%20evreu&amp;f=false|title=Istoria romanilor: Cu o privire mai larga asupra culturii|publisher=Istros|ISBN=9789731871028|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Director of the [[Securitate]]. As such, he was one of the main organizers of the repression in [[Communist Romania]], responsible for the arrest, deportation, and internment of around 400,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olaru&quot;&gt;Stejărel Olaru,  [http://www.stiftung-aufarbeitung.de/downloads/pdf/vadrum.pdf &quot;The communist regime and its legacy in Romania&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304043637/http://www.stiftung-aufarbeitung.de/downloads/pdf/vadrum.pdf |date=March 4, 2009 }}, [[Stiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur]], [[Berlin]]-Bucharest, July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Tiraspol]], [[Russian Empire]] (now in [[Transnistria]], [[Moldova]]).  As an adolescent, he fought with the [[Red Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot;&gt;[[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=4962&amp;art=11851&amp;diraut=207&amp;cHash=5fa5fde428 &quot;Cǎlǎii stalinişti - Cazul Pantiuşa&quot;], [[Cotidianul]], 21 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was recruited by Soviet intelligence to carry out [[espionage]] and [[sabotage]] actions in [[Romania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot; /&gt; He was caught, and incarcerated at the [[Doftana prison|Doftana]] and [[Caransebeş]] prisons, where he befriended [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who was to become the General Secretary of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in 1945.

After [[World War II]], Pintilie married [[Ana Toma]], a top aide to [[Ana Pauker]]. The couple adopted two children (Radu and Ioana).&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot; /&gt;  Between 1945 and 1948, he was the chief of [[Gospodăria de partid]], in control of all property of the PCR.&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot; /&gt;

In June, 1945, he led a squad that kidnapped [[Ştefan Foriş]], the previous [[General Secretary]] of the PCR. A year later, after a confidential vote at the top of the party, Pintilie beat Foriş to death with a crowbar.

At the founding of the [[Securitate]] on August 30, 1948, Gheorghe Pintilie became the first Director of this organization (the positions of Deputy Directors went to [[Alexandru Nicolschi]] and [[Vladimir Mazuru]]). In this capacity, he was directly implicated in the [[Piteşti prison]] &quot;experiment&quot;.  The majority of deportations to the  forced [[labor camps]] at the [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]]  (referred to as the &quot;graveyard of the Romanian bourgeoisie&quot; by the Communist authorities) were approved by Pintilie and his deputies.&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pacepa&quot;&gt;[[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_38106/e_timpul_ca_securitatea_sa_fie_repudiata__iv_.html &quot;E timpul ca Securitatea să fie repudiată (IV)&quot;], in [[Jurnalul Naţional]], October 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Pintilie played a considerable role in the establishment of a communist terror apparatus in Romania. As [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] argues, &quot;if one does not grasp the role of political thugs such as the Soviet spies Pintilie Bondarenko (Pantiuşa) and Alexandru Nikolski in the exercise of terror in Romania during the most horrible [[Stalinist]] period, and their personal connections with Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and members of his entourage, it is difficult to understand the origins and the role of the Securitate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalinism&quot;&gt;''Stalinism for All Seasons: A Political History of Romanian Communism'' ([[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 2003). ISBN 0-520-23747-1 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

He stayed as general director of the Securitate and as an adjunct minister in the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior of Romania|Ministry of the Interior]] until his retirement in 1963.  In 1968, &lt;!--after the rehabilitation of [[Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu]]--&gt; he was excluded from the Communist Party; nevertheless, he was decorated in 1971 by [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] with the &quot;Tudor Vladimirescu&quot; medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot; /&gt;

Pintilie died in [[Bucharest]] in 1985.  He was buried with full honors at the Ghencea Military Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;VT&quot; /&gt;

The '''ghost of Hamlet's late father''' is a character from [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'', also known as ''The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark''.  In the stage directions he is referred to as &quot;'''Ghost'''.&quot; His name is also '''Hamlet''', and he is referred to as ''King'' Hamlet to distinguish him from the Prince.

He is loosely based on a [[legend]]ary [[Jutes|Jut]]ish chieftain, named [[Horwendill]], who appears in ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'' and in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. According to oral tradition, the Ghost was originally played by Shakespeare himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnet&quot;&gt;Sylvan Barnet, &quot;Shakespeare: An Overview,&quot; in ''[[Macbeth]]'', ed. [[Sylvan Barnet]], A Signet Classic, 1998, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
:''For a synopsis of the play, see ''[[Hamlet#Synopsis|Hamlet]]''
The Ghost appears three times in the play: in Act I, Scene i; in the continuum of Act I, Scenes iv and v; and Act III, Scene iv. The ghost arrives at 1.00 a.m. in at least two of the scenes, and in the other scene all that is known is that it is night.

The Ghost first appears to a duo of soldiers&amp;mdash;Bernardo and Marcellus&amp;mdash;and a visitor to Denmark, [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]]. The men draw their swords and stand in fear, requesting that Horatio, as a scholar, address the ghost.  Horatio asks the ghost to speak, and reveal its secret.  It is about to do so when the cock crows, signaling morning, and the ghost instead disappears.  In this scene, the Ghost is clearly recognized by all present as the King, dressed in his full armour. Marcellus notes that the ghost had appeared to the castle guards twice before. Talk of spectral visitations has unsettled the night watch. Francisco, who Bernardo relieves on guard duty says, &quot;For this relief much thanks; 't is bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.&quot;&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/ghost_in_hamlet.html Egan, Maurice Francis. ''The Ghost in Hamlet and Other Essays in Comparative Literature''. Chicago: A. C. McClurg &amp; Co, 1906. pp. 11-47]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing the Ghost arrayed in a military aspect, and aware of Fortinbras marshalling his forces on the frontier, Horatio recognizes that the appearance of the Ghost must portend something regarding matters of state.&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

Horatio then persuades Prince Hamlet into staying up with the guards to see if the ghost returns. At midnight, it appears, and beckons Hamlet to follow. Once alone, the ghost describes his wanderings on the earth, and his harrowing life in purgatory, since he died without receiving [[last rites]].

He tells the young Hamlet that he was poisoned and murdered by his brother, Claudius, the new King of Denmark, and asks the prince to avenge his death.  He also expresses disgust at his wife, Gertrude, for marrying Claudius, but warns Hamlet not to confront her, but to leave that to Heaven.  Later, Prince Hamlet returns to his friends and has them swear on his sword to keep what they have seen a secret.  When they resist, the ghost utters the words &quot;Swear&quot; and &quot;Swear on the sword&quot;, from below the stage, until his friends agree.

The prince Hamlet, fearing that the apparition may be a [[demon]] pretending to be King Hamlet, decides to put the ghost to the test by staging a play that re-enacts the circumstances that the spirit claims led to his death. Claudius's reaction is one of guilt and horror, and Prince Hamlet is convinced that the ghost is, in fact, his father. However, due to his over-analytical mind and the complexity of the ghost's conditions, much time passes before Hamlet can carry out his orders.

In the third appearance, Hamlet is confronted by the ghost in his mother's closet, and is rebuked for not carrying out his revenge and for disobeying in talking with Gertrude.  Hamlet fearfully apologizes.  Gertrude, however, cannot see the ghost, and thinks Hamlet is mad, asking why he stares and talks to nothing.  In this scene, the ghost is described as being in his nightgown. He is never mentioned again.

King Hamlet is described by the few who mention him—and this excludes basically all except Hamlet, Horatio and the guards—as a warrior, as he led Denmark's forces to victory against Norway, and personally defeated its King [[Fortinbras]] in hand-to-hand combat.  Hamlet respects him, saying Claudius pales in comparison to him, and frequently reflecting on him in an endearing manner.

[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - TS Promptbooks Sh 154.75, Henry Irving 1874.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Prompter (theatre)|prompt book]] from an 1874 staging of ''[[Hamlet]]'' by English actor and manager [[Henry Irving]] (1838-1905), in which he experimented with using limelight (burning calcium oxide) to represent the ghost.]]
&quot;The Ghost in ''Hamlet'' is essential to the plot of the play.&quot;&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/460542?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Joseph, Miriam. &quot;Discerning the Ghost in Hamlet.&quot; PMLA 76.5 (1961): 493-502]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been the subject of a variety of interpretations. W.W. Greg was of the opinion that the Ghost was a figment of Hamlet's overwrought imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Greg, W.W., &quot;Hamlet's Hallucinations&quot;, MLR, XII, 1917, 393-421&lt;/ref&gt;
[[J. Dover Wilson]] and others have argued that in having the Ghost appear a number of times to others before appearing to Hamlet, Shakespeare makes clear that the apparition is not a mere illusion.&lt;ref name=Joseph/&gt;

==Performances==
About a hundred years after Shakespeare died, [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] reported that he had heard an anecdote that Shakespeare himself had played the Ghost, starting a story that continues to this day, but which has little evidence to support it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnet&quot;/&gt;

The '''Ghost''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He originated as one of [[Iron Man]]'s foes, and appeared as a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] during the &quot;[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]&quot; and &quot;[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]&quot; eras.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
The Ghost first appears in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #219 and was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Bob Layton]]. Originally portrayed as a supervillain, the character was later developed into an anti-hero figure.

He has appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' since issue #144, and has remained with the team since the title transitioned into ''Dark Avengers'' beginning with issue #175.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Recentism|section|date=March 2013}}
Very little is known about the identity of the Ghost. He claims to have been an IT researcher at one time, and to have been made into what he is by corporate greed. The Ghost is an anticapitalist saboteur who seeks to destroy various political and economic institutions he views as oppressive, apparently being most interested in those dealing with advanced technology and surveillance. He has, at times, hired his services out to corporations and other organizations, such as [[Norman Osborn]]'s Thunderbolts, that wish to destroy rival groups, but invariably plans to turn on his own employers and topple them as well.

===Origin===
As the Ghost himself told [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], he once worked as both a programmer and an engineer at a rising IT company called Omnisapient. Impressing the [[board of directors]] with his technological prowess and genius intellect, he quickly rose up the ranks and assumed the company's flagstaff project for which he developed a revolutionary processor that could physically change in reaction to its environment, becoming intangible before overheating. Thanks to his ''Ghost Tech'', the company's stock skyrocketed while the board, ever more dependent on the man who would become Ghost, collected the credit. Exhausted after months of work, the socially introverted programmer decided to leave on vacation, conflicting with the board of directors' expectations for an ahead-of-schedule launch that could increase their profit margins significantly. Approached by an attractive co-worker as he was about to leave, the young man cancelled his travel plans and began a relationship with her. Happier and more productive than ever, he now found every single aspect of his life tied to the company, all part of a well-oiled machine, until his lover died in an explosion at her apartment. Depressed over her death and unable to cope with its apparent randomness, he sought solace by immersing his consciousness into the data networks he created by wiring his own flesh with his flux-state processors. Within this network, no randomness existed and his unconscious mind, in a state of alpha, could solve any dilemma his conscious mind was unable or unwilling to. In this state, he pieced memories and hidden fragments of data together to realize his dead lover had been hired by the board to seduce him, keeping him happy and available to the company's every demand, and later murdered for blackmailing them for more money. Terrified, he attempted to flee, but his discoveries had been detected by the board of directors which dispatched a contract killer after him. The hitman detonated a bomb in his apartment before he could leave, destroying the entire building and killing dozens of tenants. However, he survived, made intangible by the flux-state processors fused with his body when a wall of fire hit him. The experience completed his psychological transformation and the once naive workaholic emerged as the Ghost, a paranoid vigilante bent on wiping out corporatocracy. He immediately took revenge upon the board of directors, butchering them all along with their contract killer, and then erased all records of his previous life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thunderbolts #151&quot;&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #151 - A Ghost's Story, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Accutech Merger===
Sometime after this, The Ghost was hired by '''Carrington Pax''', a leading executive of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Corporation]], to destroy Accutech Research and Development. Accutech was trying to develop a beta particle generator and when they refused to sell it to Roxxon, the Ghost was hired to drive Accutech into bankruptcy. [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] was interested in acquiring Accutech's technology and bought the company. Investigating a disturbance at the new facility as [[Iron Man]], he first met the Ghost. Iron Man managed to drive the Ghost from Accutech, but the Ghost swore that he would have his revenge on Iron Man's employer, Tony Stark.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

For the next few weeks, Tony Stark spent all his free time modifying his armor. Sometimes, for extra security, he would sleep in his armor, too. When Pax and the other executives at Roxxon heard that the Ghost had gone rogue, they feared his actions would make the company look bad, so they called in [[Spymaster (comics)#Third Spymaster|Spymaster]] to take care of him. After a fierce battle at Stark Enterprises, the Ghost killed Spymaster. Using a modified version of his intangibility circuits, the Ghost made Spymaster materialize in a wall. The shock caused Spymaster's whole body to shut down, and he was believed dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' #220&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown years later in [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] that the Spymaster had faked his death.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: Made Men'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony finally took the offensive against the Ghost. He set up a trap and the Ghost walked right into it. After a short battle between Iron Man and the Ghost, Iron Man cornered the Ghost in the room with the beta particle generator. He had it turned on so he could see the cloaked Ghost better, since radiation from the generator would cause interference in the Ghost's sophisticated tech-suit. However, prolonged exposure to the generator was fatal, and Iron Man didn't want to stay in the room for too long. But the Ghost had sworn to bring down Stark Enterprises and nothing, not even the chance of dying, would stop him. As he tried to reach the generator to destroy it, the intense heat from his overloading costume caused the floor to melt and the Ghost fell through. As Iron Man searched for him, all he found of the Ghost was his burnt costume. Still, Tony didn't believe that the Ghost was dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' #219-221&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unholy Ghost===
Indeed, fairly soon after, the Ghost reappeared - this time plaguing a company in Italy, owned by none other than [[Justin Hammer]].{{issue|date=March 2013}} The shrewd industrialist intended to sell the company, Electronica Fabbrizi, to Tony Stark, ridding him of a dangerous enemy and a useless asset, as well as sticking a business rival with a nasty problem.{{issue|date=March 2013}} However, after Tony Stark discovered the true ownership of the floundering company, a compromise was reached: Hammer's forces and Iron Man would cooperate in taking out the Ghost.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Hammer sent his operatives [[Blacklash]], [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]], and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] to help Iron Man fight the Ghost. However, Hammer's team betrayed Iron Man, planning to get rid of both their enemies.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Ghost attempted to kill Iron Man by rendering him intangible. While Iron Man managed to save the lives of everybody involved, Electronica Fabbrizi was irrevocably destroyed and the Ghost escaped. However, when the mysterious villain confronted Hammer, it was revealed the ruthless business man had defenses developed against the Ghost's intangibility powers, and made his own escape, leaving his assailant trapped. Blasting his way out, the saboteur vowed to continue his crusade against Hammer and all companies anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' #238-240&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghost was next hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to steal the new Roxxon process to create synthetic [[vibranium]], and battled [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghost was then defeated by [[Sunturion]], but escaped and was then defeated by [[Ultron]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Big Bang Theory===
Much later, several companies were suddenly and violently destroyed when bombs, apparently installed in personal computers, went off in inner-city offices. Tony Stark, who at the time was undercover as a common employee at one of the companies that went under, managed to track down the source of the attacks: the &quot;Advanced Corp&quot;, a cover for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]]. It was then revealed that AIM, not usually operating in common business circles, on this occasion had employed a special agent to eliminate the competition: the Ghost. Nearly defeating Iron Man in their first fight and escaping without a hitch, he hit a nasty snag during their second fight when he attempted to phase his costumed hand into Iron Man's chest, and Tony Stark's then-artificial heart defended itself, knocking him unconscious. He was subsequently arrested, but his identity appears to have remained unknown.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Inevitable===
Later still, having apparently escaped, the Ghost (in a new, more streamlined outfit) was employed by the third [[Spymaster (comics)#Third Spymaster|Spymaster]] to help free the [[Living Laser]], who was &quot;held captive&quot; by Stark Industries at the time. He attempted to kill Iron Man, and believed to have succeeded. In the end, he proved too unreliable and quirky, and was abandoned by his employer,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} remaining at large.

The Ghost was mentioned by [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] as the one who attacked him and left a NW mark on him (when it was actually the seemingly light-hearted recruit [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Dark Reign&quot;===
[[File:Ghostthunderbolts.jpg|thumb|150px|''Ghost'' as seen on a cover for ''Thunderbolts''.]]
During the &quot;[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]&quot; storyline, seems to have become more unhinged and reclusive, however, as [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms. Marvel]] mentions &quot;He smells... Badly.&quot; and The Ghost himself shows signs of increasing obsessiveness. With the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] officially disbanded, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] recruits Ghost for his new Thunderbolts, now a [[black ops]] team under Osborn's direct control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19483 The Osborn Supremacy: Thunderbolts]&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost helps Osborn take control of [[Air Force One]] with the Goblin (actually new Thunderbolts member [[Headsman (comics)|Headsman]]), [[Doc Samson]], and the new President aboard.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #128&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Osborn's plan, the Ghost phases Samson out of the plane, and drops him from the sky.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #129&lt;/ref&gt; Osborn calls for the Ghost to come to Stark Tower, where he unlocks a vault containing Iron Man's old [[Iron Man's armor|armors]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost later reveals to the [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Black Widow]] (actually [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] in disguise) that when Osborn is king of the corporate world, he'll act as &quot;a virus&quot; to bring it down from the inside. He explains he wants to inform Yelena's ''real'' boss, [[Nick Fury]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #133&lt;/ref&gt; Widow was eventually exposed as [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natalia Romanova]], who was in fact Nick Fury's undercover agent, and who was attempting to make sure Songbird stayed alive. [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], Ghost and Headsman purposely turned on the other Thunderbolts in order for the two heroines to escape. However, Ghost insisted that they stay in the Thunderbolts, for they all have their own agendas. He uses electro-convulsive shock in order to make [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Scourge]] and [[Mister X (Marvel Comics)|Mister X]] forget about the betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #133-136&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Dark Reign arc, Ghost betrayed Osborn by sending a data package he had collected to whatever heroes could receive it, warning them of Osborn's plans to capture Odin's magical weapon, Gungnir. Aware of the emergency, Quicksilver crossed the Atlantic Ocean and crushed Mister X (who wielded the weapon at the time) in combat, retrieving it.{{issue|date=December 2011}}

===&quot;Stark Disassembled&quot;===
Because Tony Stark had purposely lobotomized himself into a vegetative state, and had his power of attorney transferred over to [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Donald Blake]], [[Madame Masque]] hired Ghost to kill Stark. She provided him a phone made by the [[Tinkerer]], which he could use to execute his phase abilities to reach any place in the world. Ghost managed to track Stark to [[Broxton, Oklahoma]], where he twice attempted to assassinate Stark. All the while, Stark's comrades were attempting to reboot his brain. By then, Stark had regained consciousness and used the Ghost's own phone against him, sending him to a facility in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;''Invincible Iron Man'' #20-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thunderbolts Post-&quot;Siege&quot;===
For his help in the downfall of Norman Osborn, Ghost was recruited into  the new Thunderbolts team formed in the aftermath of Siege.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Thunderbolts-Luke-Cage-100209.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost is the first team member that Cage meets with as he arrives at the Raft.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #144&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]], he would witness [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] assassinate a police officer the Thunderbolts were meant to save.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #149&lt;/ref&gt;  Ghost would also prove instrumental in the attempted Thunderbolt break out, but in doing so, managed to go to an alternate dimension, and he came face to face with Iron Man again.  In order to beat Ghost, Iron Man transmitted into Ghost's network a confirmation that all Stark Industries divisions were being shut down effective immediately. Ghost therefore resigned from plans to kill Stark, because he is no longer a tech monopolist.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #150&lt;/ref&gt; After coming back to The Raft, Ghost told Moonstone an unverifiable origin tale, whereupon he mused over whether that means he's regained his capacity to trust or whether he simply perceives her as no threat at all, only to conclude, as he phased through a speechless Moonstone, that both are irrelevant to a man who abandoned his humanity and is truly untouchable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thunderbolts #151&quot;/&gt;

Ghost is later approached by Tiberius Stone and [[Molten Man|Mark Raxton]], who hire him to sabotage [[Parker Industries]], a competitor to Stone's own company [[Alchemax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott and Christos N.

==Powers and abilities==
The Ghost wears a [[battlesuit]] of his own design. Its ''Ghost-tech'' enables him to turn himself and any objects he touches invisible or intangible, but not both at the same time. Unknown devices in the battle-suit enable him to hack and reprogram all manner of electronic systems in his vicinity as well as intercept, tamper with or silence electromagnetic signals. This tech along with his superb intellect make him a super-hacker.

The Ghost also invented guns that fire bursts of electricity or concussive force blasts and employs a large arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including incendiary devices, self-targeting Anson grenades and sound-activated bombs. Nevertheless, he often avoids direct confrontations altogether, preferring subterfuge and ambush tactics.

He is a brilliant [[tactician]], [[inventor]] and [[hacker (hobbyist)|computer hacker]].

==Other versions==

'''''Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai''''' is a 1999 American [[crime film|crime]] [[action film]] written and directed by [[Jim Jarmusch]]. [[Forest Whitaker]] stars as the title character, the mysterious &quot;Ghost Dog&quot;, a [[hitman]] in the employ of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], who follows the ancient code of the [[samurai]] as outlined in the book of [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]]'s recorded sayings, ''[[Hagakure]]''. Critics have noted similarities between the movie and [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]'s 1967 film ''[[Le Samouraï]]''.

==Plot==
Ghost Dog ([[Forest Whitaker]]) sees himself as a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of Louie ([[John Tormey]]), a local [[mobster]], who saved Ghost Dog's life years ago. While living as a [[Professional assassin|hired hitman]] for the [[American Mafia]], he adheres to the code of the samurai, and interprets and applies the wisdom of the ''[[Hagakure]]'' in his contracts for the mob.

Louie tells Ghost Dog to kill a gangster, Handsome Frank, who is sleeping with the daughter ([[Tricia Vessey]]) of local mafia [[Boss (crime)|don]] Vargo ([[Henry Silva]]). Ghost Dog arrives and kills the gangster, before seeing that the girl is also in the room at the time; she lends him a book; he leaves her alive, and exits. In order to avoid being implicated in the murder of a [[made man]], Vargo and his associate Sonny Valerio decide to get rid of Ghost Dog. Louie knows practically nothing about Ghost Dog, and the hitman communicates only by [[homing pigeon]]. The mobsters start by tracing all the pigeon coops in town. They find Ghost Dog's cabin atop a building and kill his pigeons. Ghost Dog realizes he must kill the entire mafia or otherwise they will kill him and his master.

During the day, Ghost Dog frequently visits the park to see his best friend, a [[Haitians|Haitian]] [[ice cream]] salesman named Raymond ([[Isaach De Bankolé]]) who speaks only [[French language|French]]. Ghost Dog does not understand French and Raymond does not understand English, but the two seem to understand each other. Ghost Dog also makes friends with a little girl named Pearline ([[Camille Winbush]]), to whom he lends the book —''[[Rashōmon (short story)|Rashōmon]] and Other Stories''— he received from Vargo's daughter. Paralleling a major theme of ''Rashōmon'', Louie and Ghost Dog have different accounts of the circumstances of their meeting: in Louie's flashback he shoots Ghost Dog's attacker in [[self-defense]], while in Ghost Dog's flashback, Louie shoots the attacker just as the attacker is about to kill Ghost Dog.

Eventually, Ghost Dog attacks Vargo's mansion single-handedly and kills almost everyone he encounters, sparing only Louie and Vargo's daughter. At night, Ghost Dog kills Sonny Valerio in his house, shooting a bullet through Valerio´s bathroom pipe. Ghost Dog is later expecting that Louie attacks him (as he feels that, according to the mob code, Louie must avenge the murder of his boss Vargo). He goes to the park and gives Raymond all his money, helping him to stay in the country and build a boat. Pearline appears and gives back ''Rashōmon'' to Ghost Dog, expressing that she liked it. Ghost Dog then gives Pearline his copy of ''Hagakure'' and encourages her to read it.

Though Louie feels some loyalty to Ghost Dog, he finally confronts Ghost Dog at Raymond's ice cream stand with Raymond and Pearline watching. Ghost Dog is unwilling to attack his master and allows Louie to kill him. His last act is to give Louie the copy of ''Rashōmon'' and encourage him to read it. It is then revealed that Vargo's daughter ordered Louie to murder Ghost Dog. Pearline takes Ghost Dog's gun and shoots at Louie, but the gun is empty. Ghost Dog dies peacefully with Raymond and Pearline at his side. Later, Pearline reads passionately the ''Hagakure'', indicating that she may follow Ghost Dog's way in the future.

==Reception==
Critical response to the film was largely positive. On the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] review site, the film received an 82% &quot;Certified Fresh&quot; rating. The critical consensus was that the movie is &quot;An innovative blend of samurai and gangster lifestyles.&quot;&lt;ref name=rotten&gt;{{ cite web | year = 1999 | title=Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghost_dog_the_way_of_the_samurai/ | accessdate=2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for a few awards but did not win any of them.

===Casting notes===
[[Gary Farmer]] is credited as playing a character named &quot;Nobody&quot;, the same name as his character in Jarmusch's [[1995 in film|1995]] [[Western (genre)|western]] ''[[Dead Man]]''. After he is confronted by some mob hitmen on his roof, Nobody repeats one of his lines from ''Dead Man'': &quot;stupid fucking white man!&quot;  Forest Whitaker's younger brother [[Damon Whitaker]] plays the role of the young Ghost Dog in the flashback sequences.

==Cultural references==
The film has been interpreted by critics as an homage to ''[[Le Samouraï]]'', a 1967 crime-drama by [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] starring [[Alain Delon]]. That movie opens with a quote from an invented ''Book of Bushido'' and features a meditative, loner hero, Jef Costello. In the same manner that Ghost Dog has an electronic &quot;key&quot; to break into luxury cars, Costello has a huge ring of keys that enable him to steal any [[Citroën DS]].&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{cite web|title=Into the Void |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0009,hoberman2,12881,20.html |publisher=Village Voice |date=March 2000 |accessdate=2007-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017162233/http://www.villagevoice.com:80/film/0009,hoberman2,12881,20.html |archivedate=2007-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reel&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (2000) Reel Review |url=http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=129128&amp;buy=open&amp;Tab=reviews&amp;CID=13 |publisher=Reel.com |accessdate=2007-12-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017160804/http://reel.com/movie.asp?MID=129128&amp;buy=open&amp;Tab=reviews&amp;CID=13 |archivedate=2007-10-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The endings share a key similarity. Moreover, the peculiar relationship between the heroes of both movies and birds, as companions and danger advisers, is another common theme.

The film contains a number of references to [[Seijun Suzuki]]'s ''[[Branded to Kill]]'', such as when a bird lands in front of Ghost Dog's rifle scope, referencing the incident with a butterfly in Suzuki's film.&lt;ref name=suzuki&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost Dog shooting Sonny Valerio up the drain pipe is taken directly from ''Branded to Kill''.

[[Cartoon]]s are used as a motif that parallels plot developments. Handsome Frank watches a cartoon featuring [[Betty Boop]] corralling her pigeons moments before Ghost Dog, a fellow pigeon raiser, arrives to assassinate him. Ghost Dog is later seen handling his pigeons in the same manner as Betty.  Boss Vargo watches a [[Felix the Cat]] cartoon wherein the Professor voices his frustration at capturing the elusive Felix and his magic bag, mirroring the mafia's inability to find and eliminate Ghost Dog, who carries his weapons and equipment in a black briefcase.  Vargo and his daughter, Louise, watch a [[Woody Woodpecker]] [[Pantry Panic|cartoon]] in the car, immediately after Ghost Dog has been distracted by a woodpecker while sniping in the woods. The [[Pantry Panic|cartoon]] features a [[staring contest]] between Woody and the [[Grim Reaper]]. Vargo's daughter watches an episode of ''[[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show]]'' (in which Itchy and Scratchy threaten each other with increasingly bigger guns, before blowing up the earth) before the equally violent battle which concludes the film.

[[Guardians of Order]] published the ''[[Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (role-playing game)|Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai]]'' role-playing game in 2000.

'''''Ghost in the Machine''''' (also known as '''''Deadly Terror''''') is a 1993 American [[science fiction]] [[horror film|horror]] [[film]] directed by [[Rachel Talalay]] and released by [[20th Century Fox]].

==Plot==
A [[serial killer]] named Karl Hochman ([[Ted Marcoux]]) is known as &quot;The Address Book Killer&quot; due to his habit of stealing address books and choosing his victims from them. While he is working at a computer store, he obtains Terry Munroe's ([[Karen Allen]]) address book after another employee, who is demonstrating a scanner, copies a page of her address book into the computer. On a rainy night while heading home, Karl suddenly ends up in a collision with a truck, which causes his car to go off the road and swerve down a trail in a cemetery as he laughs. Moments later he dies as the police and ambulance arrives to the scene.

After he is put into an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machine in the emergency room, a surge from an [[Thunderstorm|electrical storm]] manages to transfer his soul into a computer. Now as a network-based entity, Karl continues to plot his killing spree using various objects connected to the [[electrical grid]] and [[computer network]]s.

Karl opens the scanned page from Terry's address book and begins to kill all the names that are on her list. Her co-worker, Frank Mallory (Richard McKenzie), becomes the first victim when he dies in an electrical fire. Another friend, Elliot Kastner (Jack Laufer), gets burned to death when a hand dryer turns into a [[flamethrower]]. Terry hires a babysitter, Carol Maibaum (Shevonne Durkin), to look after her son Josh ([[Wil Horneff]]). However, Carol becomes the third victim when she gets caught between an exploding dishwasher in the kitchen as she's electrocuted.

When the police don't believe the theory that Karl is on a killing spree after his death, Josh realizes the order of the killings is related to a list of contacts from Terry's address book that had been scanned into a computer at the computer store. Terry, along with [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] Bram Walker ([[Chris Mulkey]]), unplugs everything electrical in her house.

The police then receives anonymous reports of an armed robbery, hostage situation, domestic violence, and a murder in progress, all at Terry's house. The police open fire on the home after mistaking an exploding generator for gunfire. When they realize their mistake, they cease fire. Terry's mother was shot during the siege and she goes to the hospital for recovery. Aided by Bram and Terry, Josh manages to defeat Karl by introducing a [[computer virus]] that traps him in a physics laboratory. They activate a [[Particle accelerator|atom smasher]] located in the lab, which draws Karl in and destroys him.

The film ends with Bram telling Terry to turn off a [[heart rate monitor]] in an ambulance as a signal fades out to black.

{{Costume}}
'''Ghostface''' (alternatively stylised as '''Ghost Face''') is a fictional identity adopted by several characters of the [[Scream (film series)|''Scream'' series]].  The character is primarily mute but voiced by [[Roger L. Jackson]], regardless of who is behind the mask. The character first appeared in [[Scream (1996 film)|''Scream'']] (1996) as a disguise used by teenagers Billy Loomis ([[Skeet Ulrich]]) and Stu Macher ([[Matthew Lillard]]), during their killing spree in the fictional town of Woodsboro. Ghostface was created by [[Wes Craven]] and [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]]. The mask is based on [[The Scream]] painting by [[Edvard Munch]] and was created and designed by Fun World costume company employee Brigitte Sleiertin as a [[Halloween costume]], prior to being discovered by [[Marianne Maddalena]] and Craven for the film. The character is used primarily as a disguise for each of the antagonists of each film to conceal their identity, while conducting serial murders and as such has been portrayed by several actors.

In ''Scream'', the identity is temporarily adopted by the killers' target, [[Sidney Prescott]] ([[Neve Campbell]]), using it against them. In the ''Scream'' universe, the costume is not unique and is easily obtainable, allowing others to wear a similar outfit. Ghostface often calls its targets to taunt or threaten them while using a [[voice changer]] that hides its true identity. In ''[[Scream 3]]'', this is taken further by [[List of Scream characters#Roman Bridger|Roman Bridger]] ([[Scott Foley]]) who uses a device that enables him to sound like several other characters, in order to manipulate targets. The changing identity of the person beneath the mask means that Ghostface has no definite motivation, ranging from revenge and seeking fame to &quot;peer pressure&quot;. However, each killer shares the common goal of killing Sidney due to a [[chain of events]] indirectly caused by her mother [[List of Scream characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]] (Lynn McRee).

Initially, [[List of Scream characters#Billy Loomis|Billy Loomis]] ([[Skeet Ulrich]]) created the identity with [[List of Scream characters#Stu Macher|Stu Macher]] ([[Matthew Lillard]]) in order to kill Sidney because of her mother's affair with Billy's father. The Ghostface persona remains the same throughout the ''Scream'' series, featuring a black hood and cloak with a jagged base and a white rubber-mask resembling a ghost with a screaming expression. Though each iteration of Ghostface is human, they often exhibit extreme [[toughness|durability]] against physical harm, high levels of [[physical strength]], and an almost supernatural stealth ability; able to appear and disappear in seemingly impossible situations. The character has often appeared in [[popular culture]] since its inception, referenced in film and television as well as spawning a series of action figures and merchandise.

==Appearances==
Ghostface first appears in the opening scene of ''Scream''. The character, voiced by [[Roger L. Jackson]], calls and taunts teenager [[List of Scream characters#Casey Becker|Casey Becker]] ([[Drew Barrymore]]) with horror [[cliché]]s and trivia questions, eventually murdering her boyfriend [[List of Scream characters#Steve Orth|Steve Orth]] (Kevin Patrick Walls) in front of her before she herself is killed. The identity has been adopted by the primary antagonists of each successive film to conceal their identity, prior to being revealed in each film's final act.

[[File:Psycotic Bloody psycos wispering.jpg|left|thumb|[[List of Scream characters#Stu Macher|Stu Macher]] ''(left)'' and [[List of Scream characters#Billy Loomis|Billy Loomis]] ''(right)'', the original Ghostface killers.]]
Ghostface's first cinematic appearance was in [[Scream (1996 film)|''Scream'']] (1996) where the identity was used by a killer stalking the fictional town of Woodsboro, California. After the murder spree begins, [[Sidney Prescott]] ([[Neve Campbell]]) begins receiving taunting and threatening phone calls from Ghostface who claims knowledge of her mother [[List of Scream characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]] (Lynn McRee)'s brutal murder, one year prior to the events of the film, a murder that was blamed on [[Cotton Weary]] ([[Liev Schreiber]]). The Ghostface disguise allows suspicion to fall on many people, including Sidney's boyfriend, [[List of Scream characters#Billy Loomis|Billy Loomis]] ([[Skeet Ulrich]]), her father, [[List of Scream characters#Neil Prescott|Neil Prescott]] (Lawrence Hecht), her friend, [[List of Scream characters#Randy Meeks|Randy Meeks]] ([[Jamie Kennedy]]), and her schoolmate, [[List of Scream characters#Stu Macher|Stu Macher]] ([[Matthew Lillard]]). Ghostface is revealed in the finale as both Billy and Stu, who reveal that they murdered Sidney's mother and framed Cotton. Billy cites his motivation as abandonment by his mother ([[Laurie Metcalf]]), brought about by his father's affair with Maureen, while Stu cites &quot;peer pressure&quot;. Sidney is able to gain an advantage against Billy and Stu, temporarily adopting the Ghostface persona herself to taunt them before killing Stu. [[Gale Weathers]] ([[Courteney Cox]]) shoots Billy to stop him from killing Sidney, who then finishes Billy off with a bullet to the head.

Ghostface's second appearance was in ''[[Scream 2]]'' (1997) where it was again used as a disguise by the main antagonists. A series of murders occur at Windsor College, Sidney's current location, with the initial victims sharing names with Billy and Stu's victims from ''Scream''. The killers again taunt Sidney and attempt to kill her and later kill Randy. The Ghostface disguise allows suspicion to fall on several characters, including Cotton, again, and Sidney's boyfriend [[List of Scream characters#Derek|Derek]] ([[Jerry O'Connell]]). However, [[List of Scream characters#Mickey|Mickey]] ([[Timothy Olyphant]]), a friend of Derek, reveals himself as the killer, seeking fame for his prolific exploits. Mickey's accomplice is revealed to be Billy's mother, under the alias Debbie Salt, who is seeking revenge against Sidney for her son's death. Mrs. Loomis shoots Mickey, claiming to have indulged his desire for fame only to enlist his help in enacting her revenge, and tries to kill Sidney. With help from the exonerated Cotton, Sidney survives and Mrs. Loomis is killed. Seconds later, Mickey springs to his feet screaming, but is quickly shot to death by Gale and Sidney.

The story continues in ''[[Scream 3]]'' (2000) where the identity of Ghostface is used to murder Cotton and his girlfriend Christine, in an attempt to discover the now-hidden Sidney's location. The killer leaves images of Maureen at the crime scenes to draw Sidney out of seclusion while murdering the cast of &quot;Stab 3&quot;, the [[film within a film]] based on Sidney and her experiences with Ghostface. Ghostface is revealed as Sidney's half-brother [[List of Scream characters#Roman Bridger|Roman Bridger]] ([[Scott Foley]]), born to their mother Maureen during a two-year period when she moved to Hollywood to become an actress under the name Rina Reynolds. After being gang-raped and impregnated at a party, she gave Roman up for adoption who sought her out years later, only to be rejected, denying she had ever been Rina. Roman began stalking Maureen and filming her relationships with other men including Hank Loomis. He used this footage to reveal to Billy why his mother had &quot;abandoned&quot; him before convincing him to kill Maureen, sparking the chain of events in ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2''. With Sidney's help, her friend [[List of Scream characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]] ([[David Arquette]]) manages to kill Roman, ending the series of murders based on his revenge against Maureen.

In ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011), another Ghostface killer emerges in Woodsboro on the fifteenth anniversary of the massacre conducted by Billy and Stu; the new killer recreates events from the incident, but also films the murders to create a [[snuff film]]. Ghostface kills several teenagers and police officers before being unmasked as Sidney's cousin [[List of Scream characters#Jill Roberts|Jill Roberts]] ([[Emma Roberts]]) and her friend [[List of Scream characters#Charlie Walker|Charlie Walker]] ([[Rory Culkin]]) who intend to kill Sidney, frame Jill's ex-boyfriend [[List of Scream characters#Trevor Shelton|Trevor Shelton]] ([[Nico Tortorella]]) and become the current generation's &quot;Sidney&quot; and &quot;Randy Meeks&quot;, with the accompanying fame of being the &quot;survivors&quot; of the massacre. Jill betrays Charlie and stabs him through the heart and then seemingly kills Sidney, before purposely injuring and stabbing herself to make herself appear a victim of Ghostface. After being taken to the hospital, Dewey informs her that Sidney has survived. Jill attempts to end her life but is stalled by Dewey, Gale and [[List of Scream characters#Judy Hicks|Judy Hicks]] ([[Marley Shelton]]) long enough for Sidney to shoot her through the heart, killing her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream4&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people = Wes Craven (Director)|title = Scream 4|medium = |location=United States|publisher =Dimension Films|date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and creation==
[[File:Maskmouldmsall.jpg|thumb||left|An original [[Molding (process)|mold]] for the Ghostface mask based on Fun World's design but with significant differences, including more pronounced features, in order to avoid copyright issues.]]
The Ghostface costume is the outfit worn by the main antagonists of the ''Scream'' franchise, consisting of a rubber white mask with black eyes, nose and mouth and a black, cloth-like material, hooded-robe with faux-tatters draping from the arms and a spiked-trim to the base of the outfit. In the movie, the costume is considered common and easily purchasable making identifying the buyers difficult and creating the possibility for anyone to be the killer.

The Ghostface mask was first developed for novelty stores during the [[Halloween]] season between 1991 and 1992 by Fun World employee Brigitte Sleiertin as part of a series entitled &quot;Fantastic Faces&quot;, the mask itself known as &quot;The Peanut-Eyed Ghost&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fangoria3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kendzior |first1=Sarah |date=January 2000|title=The Face of &quot;Scream&quot; |journal=Fangoria |issue=189 |page=29 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final design was approved by Fun World vice-president Allan Geller. Craven claimed to have originally found the mask&lt;ref name=&quot;scream1dvdcommentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video| people = Wes Craven (Director) | date = December 20, 1996 | title = Scream – Commentary by Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson | url =| medium = DVD | publisher = Dimension Films | location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later clarified that he had misremembered the event and that it was producer [[Marianne Maddalena]] who discovered it. She found it while inside a house during location scouting for the film and brought it to the attention of Craven, who set about trying to obtain the rights to use it.&lt;ref name=&quot;scream2dvdcommentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video| people = Wes Craven (Director) | date = December 12, 1997 | title = Scream 2 – Commentary by Wes Craven, Patrick Lussier &amp; Marianne Maddalena | url = | medium = DVD | publisher = Dimension Films | location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fun World Licensing Director R.J. Torbert joined Fun World in 1996 and was given the task of naming the mask prior to its film debut, deciding on &quot;GhostFace&quot; with the blessing of Fun World owners Stanley and Allan Geller. Torbert felt it looked like a &quot;ghost in pain&quot;, believing it to be a unique design. The Ghostface design and title are owned by Fun World.&lt;ref name=&quot;TobertInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/39019/rj-torbert-creator-ghostface-mask-talks-scream-4 |title= R.J. Torbert Talks the GhostFace Mask and Scream 4 |date=October 8, 2010 |publisher=dreadcentral.com |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the mask bears reference to [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]'', one of the characters on the cover of the [[Pink Floyd]] album ''[[The Wall]]'' and the ghostly characters that appeared in the 1930s [[Betty Boop]] cartoon. The mask is stark white and depicts a caracature of someone screaming and crying at the same time.  Designer Sleiertin stated that the mask displayed different emotions, &quot;It's a horrible look, it's a sorry look, it's a frantic look&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fangoria3&quot;/&gt; Since the appearance of Ghostface in ''Scream'', the costume has become the most worn and sold costume for Halloween in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;HalloweenCostume&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hellosidney.com/ghostface |title= That Obscure Object of Desire... |publisher=Hello Sidney |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial script labeled the main antagonist as &quot;masked killer&quot; with no specifications to their appearance, forcing Craven and his staff to produce the costume eventually worn by Ghostface as they were shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;fangoria2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shapiro |first1=Mark |date=January 2000|title=&quot;Scream&quot; Goodbye |journal=Fangoria |issue=189 |pages=28–29 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven asked Greg Nicotero and [[Howard Berger]] of design company KNB Effects to produce a mask specifically for the film based on the Fun World design but did not like the final result. After Fun World and Dimension Films were able to complete an agreement for the use of the Ghostface mask, Craven was able to use the original design as he wanted. The custom mask made by KNB Effects still appears in the scenes involving the murder of Casey Becker and Principal Himbry as filming of these scenes completed prior to the finalization of the deal between Fun World and Dimension Films.&lt;ref name=&quot;GhostFacecouk&quot;/&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|width=30em|We came with an assortment of masks that had the ghostface look. Of the entire assortment, that face was the strongest one. The design definitely had something that made it outstanding from the others.|salign=right|— Brigitte Sleiertin on choosing the final design for what became Ghostface&lt;ref name=&quot;fangoria3&quot; /&gt;}}

[[File:Ghostfacemasks.jpg|thumb|The Ghostface masks as seen in (top left-bottom right) ''Scream'', ''Scream 2'', ''Scream 3'' and ''Scream 4''.]]
The 1991–92 &quot;Fantastic Faces&quot; edition of the mask used in ''Scream'' is made of thin, white rubber with blackened eyes, nose and mouth. Despite being portrayed by Ulrich and Lillard, the costume is mostly worn by [[stuntman]] Dane Farwell who gave the character many of its mannerisms including the [[ritual]]istic cleaning of the knife blade following a kill.&lt;ref name=&quot;scream1dvdcommentary&quot;/&gt; In the first film, Craven wore the costume during the opening murder scene where the character is struck by a phone and by Ulrich only once during a finale scene where the character prepares to murder Randy.&lt;ref name=&quot;scream1dvdcommentary&quot; /&gt; Despite Stu wearing the costume in the film, actor Lillard never actually wore the outfit.&lt;ref name=&quot;scream1dvdcommentary&quot;/&gt; ''Scream 2'' features a slightly redesigned version of the mask from the &quot;Fearsome Faces&quot; line, possessing slightly-altered eyes and an indented chin.&lt;ref name=&quot;GhostFacecouk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghostface.co.uk/maskinfo.html |title= Masks |publisher=Ghostface.co.uk |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following ''Scream 2'', the Ghostface mask became part of the &quot;Ghostface&quot; line of masks featuring several variations of the design including glow-in-the-dark models.&lt;ref name=&quot;GhostFacecouk&quot;/&gt; The plain, white version of the Ghostface line mask is used in ''Scream 3'' by Bridger.&lt;ref name=&quot;GhostFacecouk&quot;/&gt; Another edition of the mask was developed, dubbed &quot;The Deluxe Edition Mask&quot; for use by Ghostface in ''[[Scream 4]]'', again similar to the original Ghostface design but constructed of thicker rubber with a [[pearlescent]] finish.&lt;ref name=&quot;GhostFacecouk&quot; /&gt;

Following the description in Williamson's script of a &quot;ghost mask&quot;, Craven and designers had originally intended to use a white-motif, creating a white cloak and hood for the killer's costume. It was the intervention of Maddalena who felt that the cloak would be scarier if it was black, that resulted in the dark costume shown on screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;scream1dvdcommentary&quot; /&gt; The cloak itself had to be custom-made for the film as the &quot;Father Death&quot; outfit identified in ''Scream'' as that of the killers did not really exist, as the Fun World mask was sold only as a stand-alone item. The cloak entered into retail markets only following the release of ''Scream''. Each cloak was estimated to cost $700 to hand-produce by a seamstress and was made of a heavy, thick, black material with reflective threads woven throughout, creating a subtle glimmer.  The cloak was created to help conceal the identity of the killers by covering most of their visible body, as it was believed that otherwise audiences would be able to guess which character was involved by their clothing and body-shape.&lt;ref name=&quot;fangoria&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmer |first1=Randy |date=November 1997|title=The Screams |journal=Fangoria |issue=168 |pages=14–18, 82 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knife used by Ghostface in the films is a custom [[Theatrical property|prop]] knife based on the [[Buck Knives|Buck 120 Hunting Knife]] that has since been discontinued by Buck. The knife blades are made of aluminium or chrome-paint-coated plastic with a rubber handle depending on the scenario for which they are needed. The handle is black with a silver, metal-appearance for the tip. The Buck 120 knife was chosen as the model for the Ghostface weapon because of the large blade it features, though the Buck 120 itself was discontinued due to customer complaints that the blade length was deemed &quot;too big&quot; for gutting animals.{{fact|date=December 2014}}

==Characterization==
Ghostface is rarely depicted as speaking while physically on screen, in order to aid in concealing the identity of the character behind the mask. Exceptions to this are grunts and groans when injured, which are [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into the film during the [[Film editing|editing]] phase by Jackson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream1&quot;/&gt; Ghostface only speaks physically on screen on two occasions in the series; on those two occasions, it is just before his true identity is revealed. The voice given to the character, provided by Jackson, is used when talking to another character over the phone or to display the use of the voice changer when the killer reveals himself. Despite being portrayed by different characters in each film, Ghostface displays similar personality and physical attributes regardless of who is wearing the costume or speaking to a target.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream3&quot;/&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|width=30em|I can't imagine Scream without Ghostface...Roger Jackson's voice is very remarkable, it's got an evil sophistication.|salign=right|— Wes Craven on returning to ''Scream 4''&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Chris|last1=Hewitt|first2=Lucy|last2=Quick|title=Carry on Screaming|journal=Empire Magazine|page=106 |issue=262|date=March 6, 2011|publisher= Bauer Consumer Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ghostface is often shown to taunt his targets, initially representing himself as charming and even flirtatious when speaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;fangoria4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia |first1=Chris |date=January 1997|title=Scream with Fear, Scream with Laughter |journal=Fangoria |issue=159 |page=25 |publisher= Starlog Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conversations turn confrontational and intimidating, using his knowledge of other characters or graphically describing his intentions before appearing to the target physically. Craven considers Jackson's voice performance as Ghostface to have &quot;evil sophistication&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire&quot; /&gt; When confronting his intended victim, Ghostface is portrayed in varying ways, sometimes quick and efficient and other times clumsy, falling, or colliding with objects that hinder his pursuit, a characteristic that varies based upon who is wearing the costume. All of the characters that use the Ghostface disguise share the trait of taunting their victims and prolonging a kill when they appear to have an advantage. The Billy/Stu Ghostface would gut their victims after killing them; this was not performed on [[Tatum Riley]] ([[Rose McGowan]]) who was killed in a mechanical garage door.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream1&quot; /&gt; This Ghostface in particular would ask their victim questions about horror films and employ the [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of the genre in their attacks, displaying a detachment from their reality and aligned with the same self-awareness of the film itself which toys with the expectations of the horror genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;selfaware&quot;&gt;'''Casey:''' Who's there?. '''Ghostface:''' Never say who's there? Don't you watch scary movies? It's a death wish. You might as well come out to investigate a strange noise or something. {{cite video|people = Wes Craven (Director)|title = Scream|medium = DVD|location=United States|publisher =Dimension Films|date = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;selfaware2&quot;&gt;'''Sidney Prescott:''' But this is NOT a movie. '''Billy:''' Yes it is, Sidney. It's all one big movie. {{cite video|people = Wes Craven (Director)|title = Scream|medium = DVD|location=United States|publisher =Dimension Films|date = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second Ghostface, created by Mickey and Mrs. Loomis, would simply stab their victim to death but often in a public place or with witnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream2&quot; /&gt; The third Ghostface, created by Roman, used theatricality and movie props to attack his victims, using a voice changer that allowed him to sound like many other people, casting suspicion and doubt on other characters. In addition, he would use images and the synthesized voice of Maureen to specifically taunt Sidney, even shrouding himself in a bloodied, [[crime scene]] cover, alluding to the murder of Maureen, to fool Sidney into believing that she was losing her sanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream3&quot; /&gt; The fourth Ghostface, created by Jill and Charlie, filmed each murder on web cameras hidden around the environment and spy cameras in their masks. They mostly stabbed their victims to death but would go further and gut them if they wanted. They also made some of the murders public to gain the attention of the world press.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream4&quot;/&gt;

The motivations for Ghostface's killing vary in each film and are respective to each killer wearing the costume. Billy claimed to have been driven to insanity by his mother's abandonment, an incident he blamed on Maureen, and after taking his revenge on her chose to continue his spree, leading towards her daughter Sidney,&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream1&quot; /&gt; while Stu Macher lists peer pressure as his motivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream1&quot;/&gt; In ''Scream 2'', Mrs. Loomis cites her motivation as simple revenge against the person she holds responsible for her son's death, while Mickey desires the fame that his involvement in the killings will garner when he is caught.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream2&quot;/&gt; ''Scream 3'' antagonist Roman seeks revenge for what he sees as his mother's rejection and abandonment by engineering Maureen's death and trying to kill Sidney, seeing her as having the family-life he was denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream3&quot; /&gt; In ''Scream 4'', Jill, jealous of Sidney, wished to obtain similar fame as the sole survivor of a new massacre, while Charlie aided her both for those reasons and his love for Jill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream4&quot;/&gt;

In costume, the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of gripping the blade of their knife between thumb and forefinger and wiping it clean of any blood following a murder by drawing their hand from handle to the tip of the knife. This characteristic was given to the character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in ''Scream''.&lt;ref name=&quot;scream1dvdcommentary&quot;/&gt; Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical [[Skill|abilities]], such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth, prowling without being detected, moving silently, and efficiently vanishing from their targets' defense. Additionally, the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims, such as in ''Scream 2'', in regards to defeating two trained detectives single-handedly. Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage, surviving [[blunt trauma]], [[stabbing]] [[wound]]s and [[gunshot]]s. Billy, Mickey, Roman, and Jill all had to be shot through the head or multiple times to the chest to be killed, despite having sustained severe injuries prior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scream3&quot;/&gt;

Ghostface has been parodied and referenced numerous times in media following his appearance in the ''Scream'' series of slasher films, most prominently in the parody film ''[[Scary Movie]]'' (2000) where a killer dressed as Ghostface commits a series of murders and is later revealed to be several people as in ''Scream''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScaryMovie&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people = Keenen Ivory Wayans (Director)|title = Scary Movie|medium = DVD|location=United States|publisher =Dimension Films|date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the parody film ''[[Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth]]'' (2000), a killer wearing a [[Jason Voorhees]]-style hockey mask is set on fire, his mask melting to resemble that of Ghostface.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShriekMovie&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people = John Blanchard (Director)|title = Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth|medium = DVD|location=United States|publisher =Lions Gate Films|date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001) features Ghostface, as [[Shannen Doherty]] and Craven provide cameos as themselves making the then non-existent ''Scream 4'', but Doherty objects when Ghostface turns out to be played by the [[orangutan]], Suzann.&lt;ref name=&quot;JayandSilentBobStrikeBack&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people = Kevin Smith (Director)|title =Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back|medium = DVD|location=United States|publisher =Dimension Films, Buena Vista International|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in film, Ghostface has been referenced repeatedly in various [[television]] programs and commercials. In the same year as the release of ''Scream 3'', the mask made an appearance on [[Beverly Hills 90210]] and the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] series [[Cousin Skeeter]]. It was also used as an [[ornament (art)|ornament]] in the bedroom of the character Dawson in [[Dawson's Creek]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson1&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Decisions|series=[[Dawson's Creek]]|credits=[[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]]|network=[[The WB]]|airdate=May 19, 1998|season=1|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a show created by ''Scream'' writer, Williamson.&lt;ref name=&quot;fangoria2&quot; /&gt; The character appears in a 1999 episode of ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'' entitled &quot;The Unknown Murderer&quot;, where he threatens to kill a [[scream queen]] every round, murdering Barrymore, [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], and [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] before planting his cell phone on a [[platypus]] to frame him, causing Campbell and [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] to fight it.&lt;ref name=&quot;CelebrityDeathmatch5&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Unknown Murderer]]|series=[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]|credits=[[Eric Fogel]]|network=[[MTV]]|airdate=February 25, 1999|season=1|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mask was later used in ''[[The Sopranos]]'' episode &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; (2001) where it is worn by the character Christopher to commit a robbery.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheSopranos1&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Fortunate Son (The Sopranos)]]|series=[[The Sopranos]]|credits=[[David Chase]]|network=[[HBO]]|airdate=November 3, 2001|season=3|number=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film'', Adam Rockoff opined that Ghostface's mask was a &quot;striking, surreal and downright terrifying presence&quot;. Calling the mask a &quot;hyperbolic rendering&quot; of Edvard Munch's ''The Scream'', Rockoff wrote that the face is &quot;twisted in an exaggerated, almost mocking grin, as if reflecting the look of terror and surprise on his victims' faces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Rockoff | first =Adam | title =Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film| publisher =McFarland | year =2002| isbn =0-7864-1227-5 | page =181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Magistrale]] also discussed the similarities between Ghostface's mask and ''The Scream'' in his book ''Abject Terrors: Surveying the Modern and Postmodern Horror Film'', stating that the painting, &quot;an apt representation of the degree of alienation from other people, inspires the killers' murderous agenda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Magistrale| first =Tony| authorlink =Tony Magistrale | title =Abject Terrors: Surveying the Modern and Postmodern Horror Film | publisher =Peter Lang | year =2005 | location =University of Michigan | isbn =0-8204-7056-2 | page =186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Giallo''''' is a 2009 [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]]-American-British [[horror film|horror]]-''[[Giallo|giallo film]]'' co-written and directed by [[Dario Argento]] and starring [[Adrien Brody]], [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] and [[Elsa Pataky]].

The film was poorly received at the time of its release, and is currently and arguably most-known for Brody's lawsuit against the film for not having been paid rather than the movie itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://variety.com/2010/biz/news/adrien-brody-wins-giallo-lawsuit-1118027936/|title=Adrien Brody wins ‘Giallo’ lawsuit|last=Press|first=Associated|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
[[Turin, Italy]]: [[France|French]] flight attendant Linda and [[Italian-American]] detective Enzo Avolfi team up to find Linda's younger sister Celine. Celine, a model, has been abducted by a serial killer. Known only as &quot;Yellow&quot; (&quot;Giallo&quot; in Italian) he kidnaps beautiful foreign women in his unlicensed taxi cab. After drugging them, the killer proceeds to mutilate and finally murder them. He photographs his deeds so that the photos may grant him personal sexual gratification.

Enzo receives a phone call from a fellow officer, who finds the body of an Asian woman outside a church near a fountain. They find out she's still alive, and starts to speak in Japanese. Enzo and Linda start to look for a translator, who tells them that the girl was praying Buddha and then repeated &quot;yellow&quot;. They visit the morgue, where Linda realizes that the killer's face could be yellow, and the coroner tells Enzo that yellow skin is symptom of liver disease, so the killer might be in the waiting list for a new liver.

They go to hospital and find Giallo but he escapes. Enzo finds out his name is Flavio Volpe and gets his address. Giallo starts to torture Celine by cutting one of her fingers when starts to bad-mouth him. Enzo breaks into Giallo's apartment, but finds it empty and full of torture devices.

Enzo tells Linda why he became a policeman: long ago, Enzo, who was 10, witnessed his mother being murdered by a local butcher, whom she owed money to. 5 years later, Enzo kills the butcher in his own shop, while Inspector Mori knew why he did it. Mori took him in as if he were his own son. Enzo had kept the knife he used to kill the butcher as a reminder of how he became a cop. Enzo also tells Linda that Giallo might be a pattern killer who hates beautiful women, due to his deformity.

Over the course of the film, Enzo and Linda find more victims and clues as to who the killer is, and why he tortures them. An origin story shows that Giallo's mother was a prostitute that gave her son up for adoption at a church, where orphaned kids started to bully him. Celine tries to escape from Giallo, but gets captured. Just when he was about to strangle her, Celine tells him she's rich and will reward him with money.

Giallo breaks into Linda's apartment and demands a ransom for the safe return of Celine. The film ends with Enzo and Giallo having a shootout in a hotel. Giallo tries to escape, but falls from a skylight to the floor of the lobby, killing him instantly. The police search his apartment for Celine, but cannot find her. They also try finding her at an abandoned gas factory where Giallo brings his victims.

Linda starts to blame Enzo for killing her sister, as well as calling him selfish and inhumane, because Giallo was going to tell her the location of where her sister is. Enzo tries to convince Linda that he was a killer and couldn't be trusted. After telling her this, he walks away, while Linda continues to berate him. By chance, while patrolling a car park, a policeman hears Celine as she tries to gain his attention, tied up and gagged in the trunk of Giallo's car.

== Production notes==
&quot;Giallo&quot; is the Italian word for &quot;yellow,&quot; and since the 1960s has also been a [[Giallo|term used for a specific genre of crime fiction]].

Argento said in an interview that he dislikes the producers' cut of the film and that he no longer is attached to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2009/05/yellow-fever-sean-keller-on-writing-giallo-for-dario-argento/ |title=Yellow Fever: Sean Keller on Writing &quot;Giallo&quot; for Dario Argento |last=Gracey |first=James |date=26 May 2009 |work=[[Cinefantastique]] |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
''Giallo'' premiered at the 2009 [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Film Archive |url=https://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/films/2009/giallo |work=[[Edinburgh International Film Festival|edfilmfest.org.uk]] |accessdate=6 August 2009|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in America at the Omaha International Film Festival in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] on 14 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.killerfilm.com/film_reviews/read/giallo-review-27700 |title=Giallo - Review |last=Jon |first=Peters |date=17 March 2010 |work=killerfilm.com |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming he was not paid the correct amount for his role in the film, Adrien Brody filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers, and attempted to prevent the film's release on DVD until he received his full salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/10/18/adrien-brody-sues-dario-argentos-giallo/?_r=true |title=Adrien Brody Sues to Stop Release of Dario Argento's 'Giallo' - The Moviefone Blog |last=Novikov |first=Eugene |date=18 October 2010 |work=moviefone.com |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late November 2010 Brody was granted a ruling in [[United States District Court]] that blocked the sale or use of Brody's likeness in ''Giallo'' until the actor's remaining salary was paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/adrien-brody-says-he-had-no-alternative-but-to-sue-makers-of-thriller-film-blocked-by-judge_article_40288 |title=Brody: No Alternative But To Sue Film Producers |date=25 November 2010 |work=[[Access Hollywood|accesshollywood.com]] |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 2011, ''Deadline Hollywood Daily'' reported that Brody had reached a settlement with the producers. Brody stated, &quot;I very much enjoyed the process of making ''Giallo'' and am happy that things have been resolved and that people can now enjoy seeing the film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/01/adrien-brody-settles-pay-dispute-on-giallo/ |title=Adrien Brody Settles Pay Dispute On 'Giallo' - Deadline.com |last=Fleming |first=Mike |date=20 January 2011 |work=deadline.com |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
''Giallo'' has received a negative reception from critics. ''[[Fangoria]]'' gave the film a 1/4 rating, writing, &quot;this is a deeply disappointing work from a director who seems to be yellowing with age, his vision progressively jaundicing. After so many consecutive misfires, it might seem that Argento's creative career is coming to an end. With a film like ''Giallo'', he only builds the gallows higher.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php/reviews/movies/873-giallo-film-review |title=&quot;GIALLO&quot; (Film Review) |last=Kloda |first=James |date=16 May 2010 |work=[[Fangoria|fangoria.com]] |accessdate=4 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Kermode]] called it a &quot;depressingly sleazy shocker&quot; that &quot;descends rapidly into self-pastiche, with even the director's trademark gliding camera moves and elegant architectural framings failing to raise the murky tone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/17/giallo-unknown-country-kermode-dvd |title=Mark Kermode's DVD round-up |last=Kermode |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Kermode |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=4 August 2012 |location=London |date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Total Film]]'' wrote, &quot;this Turin-based turkey has more in common with bargain-basement [[splatter film#torture porn|torture porn]] than the classy [[slasher film|slashers]] that made Argento's name.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/dvd/giallo |title=Giallo review &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; TotalFilm.com |last=Smith |first=Neil |date=8 August 2011 |work=[[Total Film|totalfilm.com]] |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born '''Byron Elsworth Barr''' in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]], he and his older siblings were raised by his parents, John and Emma Barr, in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] initially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert |title=The Hollywood Book of Death: The Bizarre, Often Sordid, Passings of More Than 125 American Movie and TV Idols|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2002|edition=3|pages=335|isbn=0-8092-2227-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he was six, his family moved back to their hometown of [[Waynesville, North Carolina]], where he was raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig Young's family grave &amp; info&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.canoe.ca/parker/news/the-bizarre-death-and-mysterious-burial-of-a-hollywood-oscar-winner/comment-page-2/ Gig Young's family grave &amp; info]&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a passion for the [[theatre]] while appearing in high school plays, and after some amateur experience he applied for and received a [[scholarship]] to the acclaimed [[Pasadena Community Playhouse]]. While acting in ''Pancho'', a south-of-the-border play by Lowell Barrington, he and the leading actor in the play, [[George Reeves]], were spotted by a [[Warner Brothers]] [[talent scout]].

After appearing in the 1942 film ''[[The Gay Sisters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gay Sisters|last=Longstreet|first=Stephen|publisher=Random House / Grosset Dunlap|year=1942|isbn=|location=USA|pages=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034770/}}&lt;/ref&gt; – written by [[Stephen Longstreet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gay Sisters|last=Longstreet|first=Stephen|publisher=Random House/Grosset Dunlap|year=1942|isbn=|location=USA|pages=http://www.isbnsearch.org/search?s=The+Gay+Sisters}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1907–2002) – as a character named &quot;Gig Young&quot;,  the studio determined that &quot;Gig Young&quot; should become Barr's stage and professional name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monush|first=Barry |title=Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era To 1965|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2003|pages=810|isbn=1-55783-551-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young appeared in supporting roles in numerous films during the 1940s, and came to be regarded as a popular and likable second lead, playing the brothers or friends of the principal characters. Young took a hiatus from his movie career and enlisted in the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1941 where he served as a [[pharmacist's mate]] until the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/gigyoung.asp|title=Coast Guard History: Gig Young|date=2008-07-22|publisher=uscg.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In early 1942, in an uncredited bit part and nearly unseen, in his distinctive voice, he had one line, &quot;How's the ice?&quot;, in the [[Bette Davis]] film ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner (film)|The Man Who Came to Dinner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whosdatedwho.com/tpx_655112/the-man-who-came-to-dinner/&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two years later, he played opposite her as her much-younger beau in ''[[Old Acquaintance]]''.

After Young's return from the war, Warner Bros. dropped his option. He then began freelancing at various studios, eventually obtaining a contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] before returning to freelancing. During those years, Young began to play the type of role that he would become best known for, a sardonic but engaging and affable drunk. His dramatic work as an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] in the 1951 film ''[[Come Fill the Cup]]'' with [[James Cagney]] and his comedic role as a tipsy but ultimately charming intellectual in ''[[Teacher's Pet (1958 movie)|Teacher's Pet]]'' starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Doris Day]] earned him nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

==Success and decline==
In 1955, Young became the host of ''[[Warner Bros. Presents]]'', an umbrella title for three television series (''[[Casablanca (film)#Sequels and other versions|Casablanca]]'', ''[[King's Row]]'', and ''[[Cheyenne (TV western)|Cheyenne]]'') that aired during the 1955–56 season on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson,|first=Robert J. |author2=Burns, Gary |title=Making Television: Authorship and the Production Process|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|pages=95–96|isbn=0-275-92746-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a supporting role the same year in the Humphrey Bogart thriller ''[[The Desperate Hours (film)|The Desperate Hours]]''. Young is also remembered by many [[James Dean]] fans for the &quot;driving safety&quot; interview made shortly before Dean's fatal car accident in September, 1955.  On the 1964–65 [[NBC]] series ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'', he shared appearances on a rotating basis with [[David Niven]] and [[Charles Boyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guida|first=Fred |author2=Wagenknecht, Edward|title=A Christmas Carol and Its Adaptations: A Critical Examination of Dickens's Story and Its Productions on Screen and Television|publisher=McFarland|year=2006|pages=193|isbn=0-7864-2840-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young won the [[Academy Award]] for his role as Rocky, the [[Marathon dancing|dance marathon]] [[Master of Ceremonies|emcee]] and promoter in the [[1969 in film|1969]] film ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'' According to his fourth wife, Elaine Williams, &quot;What he was aching for, as he walked up to collect his Oscar, was a role in his own movie—one that they could finally call 'a Gig Young movie.' For Young, the Oscar was literally the kiss of death, the end of the line&quot;.&lt;ref name=holden&gt;{{cite book|last=Holden|first=Anthony|title=Behind the Oscar: The Secret History of the Academy Awards|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1993|pages=275|isbn=0-671-70129-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young himself had said to [[Louella Parsons]], after failing to win in 1951, &quot;so many people who have been nominated for an Oscar have had bad luck afterwards.&quot;&lt;ref name=holden /&gt;

After a substantial supporting role in ''[[Lovers and Other Strangers]]'' in 1970, alcoholism began to cost him roles. He collapsed on the set of the comedy film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' during his first day of shooting due to [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]], and was fired.&lt;ref name=donnelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Donnelly|first=Paul |title=Fade To Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries|publisher=Omnibus|year=2005|edition=3|pages=746|isbn=1-84449-430-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parish|first= James Robert |title=It's Good to Be the King: The Seriously Funny Life of Mel Brooks|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2008|pages=9|isbn=0-470-22526-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young's last role was in the 1978 film ''[[Game of Death]]'', released nearly six years after the film's star, [[Bruce Lee]], died during production in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eleftheriotis|first=Dimitris |author2=Needham, Gary|title=Asian Cinemas: A Reader and Guide|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2006|pages=423|isbn=0-8248-3085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Young was married five times; his first marriage to Sheila Stapler lasted seven years, ending in 1947. In 1950, he married Sophie Rosenstein, the resident drama coach at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], who was several years Young's senior.  She was soon diagnosed with [[cancer]], and died just short of two years after the couple's wedding. After her death, Young was engaged to actress [[Elaine Stritch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alix |last=Kirsta |title=Nobody's Perfect |work=Telegraph |page= |date=20 February 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2009 |quote= Despite a long engagement to Gig Young and living with Ben Gazzara, whom she threw over for Rock Hudson ('and we all know what a bum decision that turned out to be') she got married only once, at the age of 47, to the actor John Bay whom she met in London on Small Craft Warnings. |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4728845/Nobodys-perfect.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He met actress [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] after she appeared in an episode of ''Warner Bros. Presents'' in 1956, and the two married later that year.&lt;ref name=donnelly /&gt; In 1963, Montgomery divorced Young because of his alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strodder|first=Chris |title=Swingin' Chicks of the '60s: A Tribute to 101 of the Decade's Defining Women|publisher=Cedco Pub.|year=2000|pages=167|isbn=0-7683-2232-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young married his fourth wife, real estate agent Elaine Williams, nine months after his divorce from Montgomery was final. Williams was pregnant with Young's child at the time and gave birth to his only child, Jennifer, in April 1964. After three years of marriage, the couple divorced. During a legal battle over [[child support]] with Williams, Young denied that Jennifer was his biological child. After five years of court battles, Young lost his case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsay|first=Mark |author2=Lester, David Lester|title=Suicide By Cop: Committing Suicide by Provoking Police to Shoot You|publisher=Baywood Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2004|pages=72–73|isbn=0-89503-290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 1978, Young, age 64, married his fifth wife, a 31-year-old German magazine editor named Kim Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19781020&amp;id=y8ktAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=06AFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2903,6310914&lt;/ref&gt; He met Schmidt in [[Hong Kong]] while working on ''[[Game_of_Death#Game_of_Death_.281978.29|Game of Death]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&amp;dat=19781020&amp;id=BydJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rgUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3780,4564450&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On October 19, 1978, three weeks after his marriage to Schmidt, the couple was found dead at home in their [[Manhattan]] apartment. Police theorized that Young shot his wife and then turned the gun on himself. A motive for the murder-suicide was never made clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,623682,00.html|title=OSCARS: Woman Seeks Dad's Statuette|last=Darst|first=Elizabeth |newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=March 15, 2002|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was at one time under the care of the psychologist and psychotherapist [[Eugene Landy]], who would later have his professional California medical license revoked amidst accusations of ethical violations and patient misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Eugene Landy|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/31/db3102.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/03/31/ixportal.html|work=''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|date=March 31, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225202250/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/31/db3102.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/03/31/ixportal.html|archivedate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried in the Green Hill Cemetery in [[Waynesville, North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brettell|first=Andrew|author2=King, Noel |author3=Kennedy, Damien |author4= Imwold, Denise |others=Leonard, Warren Hsu; von Rohr, Heather|title=Cut!: Hollywood Murders, Accidents, and Other Tragedies|publisher=Barrons Educational Series|year=2005|pages=292|isbn=0-7641-5858-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his family's plot along with his parents, siblings and an uncle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig Young's family grave &amp; info&quot;/&gt; Young's [[Will (law)|will]], which covered a $200,000 estate, left his Academy Award to his agent, [[Martin Baum (agent)|Martin Baum]] and Baum's wife, Bernice;&lt;ref name=holden /&gt; however, Young's daughter Jennifer launched a campaign in the early 1990s to get the award back from his agent, and struck an agreement that she would get the award back upon the agent's death, which occurred in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig Young's family grave &amp; info&quot;/&gt;

For his contribution to the television industry, Young has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6821 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

'''Gilbert Millington'''&lt;ref&gt;His name was spelt ''Gilbert Millington'' in the [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=13968#s13 Proclamation for apprehending the late King's Judges] (4 June 1660), but as '''Gilbert Myllington''' in [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=14215#s12 House of Lords Journal Volume 11] 7 February 1662&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 1598–1666) was a barrister and one of the [[Regicide]]s of King [[Charles I of England]].

==Life==
Millington was probably born at [[Felley Priory]] in about 1598. He was the eldest son of Anthony and Prudence Millington and was educated at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] becoming a member of Lincoln's Inn in 1614 and a barrister there by 1621. He had married in 1618 and inherited his father's estates in 1620. The estate was over 800 acres and enabled Millington to support causes in Nottingham and later in Parliament. He took on various public jobs in Nottingham looking after the sewers and then as [[Deputy Lieutenant for Nottinghamshire]] firstly in 1638.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Richard L. Greaves, ‘Millington, Gilbert (c.1598–1666)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18761, accessed 30 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the Master of Chancery in 1639 and he was elected as an M.P. for [[Nottingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham]], in the [[Long Parliament]] of 1640. He was made deputy-lieutenant for Nottinghamshire again in 1642. He was agent of communication between the Governor of Nottingham Castle, [[John Hutchinson (Colonel)|Colonel John Hutchinson]] (1615–1664), and the county committee, who were in dispute over the control of local troops. In 1649 he was one of the few barristers and he was energetic at the [[trial of Charles I]] and amongst those who signed the king's death-warrant. After the [[restoration (England)|restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660 he was condemned to death, but his sentence was later commuted on appeal to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Lee|Lee, Sidney]] (1903), [[Dictionary of National Biography]] [https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft Index and Epitome], [https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft#page/878/mode/1up p. 878] (also main entry xxxvii 440)&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his final days at [[Mont Orgueil Castle]] on Jersey where he died on the 19 September 1666.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

'''Gilbert Paul Jordan''' (December 12, 1931 – July 7, 2006),&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Dead - http://serial-killers.findthedata.org/detail/303/Gilbert-Paul-Jordan&lt;/ref&gt; known as the &quot;'''Boozing Barber'''&quot;,  was a Canadian [[serial killer]] who is believed to have committed the so-called &quot;alcohol murders&quot; in [[Vancouver]], Canada.

==Background==
Jordan, a former barber, was linked to the deaths of between eight and ten women between 1965 and 1988; he was the first Canadian to use alcohol as a murder weapon. Jordan's lengthy criminal record started in 1952 and includes convictions for [[rape]], [[indecent assault]], [[Kidnapping|abduction]], [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]], [[drunk driving]] and [[car theft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BC Jordan&quot;&gt;CBC: Boozing Barber: http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/08/31/bc_jordan000831.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CTV story&quot;&gt;CTV: Boozing Barber: http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1092327960246_87737160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1991-2908&quot;&gt;R. v. Jordan [1991] B.C.J. No. 2908&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Jordan was examined by Dr. Tibor Bezeredi as part of a court proceeding. Dr. Bezeredi diagnosed Jordan as having an [[antisocial personality]], defined by Dr. Bezeredi as &quot;a person whose conduct is maladjusted in terms of social behaviour; disregard for the rights of others which often results in unlawful activities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1991-010272&quot;&gt;Quoted in the court decision, R. v. Jordan [1991] B.C.C.A. CA010272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killings==
In 1965, Jordan was said to begin serial killing. He is considered a serial killer as he was linked to the deaths of between eight and ten women, but was only convicted in the manslaughter death of one woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowman report&quot;&gt;Justice Canada. Technical Report. Violence Against Persons Who Prostitute: The Experience in British Columbia by John Lowman and Laura Fraser. (Ottawa: Department of Justice Canada, 1995), online: http://24.85.225.7/lowman_prostitution/HTML/violence/Violence_Against_Persons_Who_Prostitute.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; His victims were Aboriginal women in Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]]. Typically he would find women in bars, and buy them drinks, or pay them for sex and encourage them to drink with him. When they passed out, he would pour liquor down their throats.&lt;ref name=&quot;National post&quot;&gt;National Post: History of Serial Killers: http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posted/archive/2007/12/12/a-sordid-history-of-canadian-killers.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting deaths were reported as [[alcohol poisoning]] and police paid little attention, because some of his victims were alcoholics. Although the newspapers often described the  women as prostitutes, not all were involved in prostitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowman report&quot; /&gt; Jordan was known for drinking more than 50 [[ounce]]s of [[vodka]] each day.&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;

The first woman known to have died by alcohol poisoning while in Jordan's company was in 1965. As would become a pattern, a switchboard operator named Ivy Rose was found naked and dead in a [[Vancouver]] hotel. Her blood alcohol level was 0.51. No charges were laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;FNDrum&quot;&gt;First Nations Drum: http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/2009/april/gpj.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Court proceedings show &quot;he sought out approximately 200 women per year for binge drinking episodes covering the period from 1980 to 1988.  He was also looking for sexual gratification.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1991-010272&quot; /&gt; Further, the Crown provided evidence that Jordan was linked to the deaths of six other Aboriginal women. Similar fact evidence showed Jordan had been with the following women at the time of their death:&lt;ref name=&quot;1988-1927&quot;&gt;R. v. Jordan [1988] B.C.J. No. 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

*Mary Johnson, November 30, 1980, at the Aylmer Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .34
*Barbara Paul, September 11, 1981, at the Glenaird Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .41
*Mary Johns, July 30, 1982, at 2503 Kingsway (his barbershop) Blood alcohol level: .76
*Patricia Thomas, December 15, 1984, at 2503 Kingsway (his barbershop) Blood alcohol level: .51
*Patricia Andrew, June 28, 1985,  at 2503 Kingsway (his barbershop) Blood alcohol level: .79
*Vera Harry, November 19, 1986, at the Clifton Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .04

==Investigation==
On October 12, 1987, Vanessa Lee Buckner was found naked on the floor of the Niagara hotel after a night of drinking with Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;2003-237&quot;&gt;R. v. Jordan, [2003] B.C.J. No. 237&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate regarding the victim. Some sources indicate that she was a white woman, not a heavy drinker, nor was she a prostitute.&lt;ref name=&quot;FNDrum&quot;/&gt; However, in official court records describe Ms. Buckner death as the result of Jordan &quot;...supplying a lethal amount of liquor to a female alcoholic, who died as a result&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002-330&quot;&gt;R. v. Jordan [2002]BCCA 330&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Buckner had recently lost custody of her newborn baby, who had been born with a drug dependency. She &quot;was an alcoholic and a taker of various kinds of drugs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1988-1927&quot; /&gt;  Jordan's [[fingerprint]]s were found and linked to Ms. Buckner's death.&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt; A month after her death, another woman, Edna Shade, was found dead in another hotel.

After being questioned, Jordan had not been charged with any crime related to Ms. Buckner's death. However, police initiated surveillance on Jordan. Between October 12 and November 26, 1987, police watched him &quot;search out native Indian women in the skid row area of Vancouver. On 4 different occasions they [the police] rescued the woman involved before she too became a victim&quot;. Those women were:&lt;ref name=&quot;1988-1927&quot; /&gt;

*Rosemary Wilson, November 20, 1987, at the Balmoral Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .52
*Verna Chartrand, November 21, 1987, at the Pacific Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .43
*Sheila Joe, November 25, 1987, at the Rainbow Hotel, Blood alcohol level: unknown
*Mabel Olson, November 26, 1987, at the Pacific Hotel, Blood alcohol level: unknown&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the court records, police listening outside the hotel rooms heard Jordan say such things as:

&quot;Have a drink, down the hatch baby, 20 bucks if you drink it right down; see if you're a real woman; finish that drink, finish that drink, down the hatch hurry, right down; you need another drink, I'll give you 50 bucks if you can take it; I'll give you 10, 20, 50 dollars, whatever you want, come on I want to see you get it all down; you get it right down, I'll give you the 50 bucks and the 13 bucks; I'll give you 50 bucks. I told you that. If you finish that I'll give you $75; finish your drink, I'll give you $20&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1988-1927&quot; /&gt;

==Convictions and arrests==
This similar fact evidence was important in the 1988 trial. Jordan was tried before a judge alone. Justice Bouck found Jordan guilty of [[manslaughter]] in the death of Ms. Buckner.&lt;ref name=&quot;1988-1927&quot; /&gt; He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, but that was reduced to nine years on appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;1991-3490&quot;&gt;R. v. Jordan [1991] B.C.J. No. 3490&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan served six years for the manslaughter conviction. After his release, he was placed on [[probation]] which restricted him to [[Vancouver Island]]. In June 2000, he had been charged with sexual assault, assault, negligence causing bodily harm and administering a noxious substance—alcohol.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw&quot;&gt;GPJ: http://members.shaw.ca/pdg/gilbert-paul-jordan.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Jordan attempted to change his name to Paul Pearce.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc 011227&quot;&gt;CBC: Name change: http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2001/12/27/names011227.html&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, a name change in [[British Columbia]] did not require fingerprinting or a criminal check. After the loophole was closed, he dropped the application.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc 011227&quot; /&gt;

Jordan was arrested again, in 2002 for breach of probation because he was found drinking, and in the presence of a woman while in possession of alcohol. He was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months in jail, followed by three years probation and strict conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw&quot; /&gt;

However, on August 11, 2004, he was arrested in [[Winnipeg]] for violating that probation order for an incident at the York Hotel in Swift Current, [[Saskatchewan]], August 9, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTV story&quot; /&gt; He had been identified as being a party to binge drinking with Barb Burkley. Ms. Burkley was a long term resident of the hotel and had a serious drinking problem. Ms. Burkley was taken to the hospital by her friend and hotel employee, Cathy Waddington, after finding Ms. Burkley in very bad condition. Ms. Waddington identified Jordan as being there, but he was acquitted of those charges in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;reasons2005&quot;&gt;R. v. Jordan - Excerpt Reasons for Sentence [2005] BCPC 0068&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his release, police issued a public warning.&lt;ref name=&quot;police&quot;&gt;Saanich Police- Public Warning: http://www.saanichpolice.ca/crimewatch/media/archives/notificationjordan.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan died in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;National post&quot; /&gt;

===Police warning===
On February 3, 2005, the [[Saanich, British Columbia|Saanich]] Police Department issued an alert warning the public to be cautious of the recently released Jordan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:JORDAN, Gilbert Paul, age 73, is the subject of this alert.  JORDAN is 175cm (5'9&quot;) tall and weighs 79kgs (174lbs) [sic].  He is partially bald with grey hair and a grey goatee. He has blue eyes and wears glasses. JORDAN is currently in the Victoria area but has no fixed address. JORDAN has a significant criminal record including manslaughter and indecent assault of a female. He uses alcohol to lure his victims. JORDAN's target victim group is adult females. JORDAN is subject to court ordered conditions including:
::- Abstain absolutely from the consumption of alcohol.
::- Not to be in the company of any female person or persons in any place where alcohol is being either consumed or possessed by that person or persons.

:If you observe the subject in violation of any of the above conditions please call the Saanich Police Department at 475-4321, 911 or your local police agency. If you have questions concerning the public notification process please contact the BC Corrections Branch at 250-387-6366.&lt;ref name=&quot;police&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cultural impact==
Jordan was the subject of the 1997 Canadian television program ''Exhibit A: Secrets of Forensic Science'' in an episode called &quot;Dead Drunk&quot;. The program described the [[forensic]] work used to convict him in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;exhibit&quot;&gt;Exhibit A: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0574359/&lt;/ref&gt;

A dramatization, ''The Unnatural and Accidental Women'' was written by Vancouver playwright [[Marie Clements]] and performed in, among other places, [[Buddies in Bad Times Theatre]] in Toronto (2004). In the play, the writer focused on the story of the victims in an attempt to redress the failure of the news media to do so.

Marie Clements later wrote a script for the movie ''[[Unnatural &amp; Accidental]]'' which premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;movie&quot;&gt;Unnatural &amp; Accidental: http://www.northernstars.ca/titles/2006/unnatrural_and_accidental.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan and his crimes served as inspiration for the first several episodes of ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]''.  The crime series, set in Vancouver, portrayed a serial killer using alcohol as a murder weapon and stalking prostitutes.  The portrayal departed from the facts by having the killer die before he could be arrested; he was murdered by one of his victims' brother, tipped to his identity by a detective.&lt;ref name=&quot;inquest&quot;&gt;Da Vinci's Inquest: http://www.davincisinquest.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Gilda is a [[sculptor]], Harvey believes that she worships beauty; therefore (in Dent's mind), neither she—nor anyone else—could ever love or accept a person with such a monstrously &quot;hideous&quot; face as his. Gilda creates a bust of Harvey, which he smashes with a mallet to symbolize his new, ruined self. Even as Two-Face begins a dual career of crime and [[Robin Hood]]-style [[philanthropy]], however, he still longs passionately for Gilda, and she for him.

In ''Detective Comics'' # 80 (1943),&lt;ref&gt;Finger, Bill(W), Kane, Bob(A), Detective Comics #80: &quot;The End of Two-Face!&quot;, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; she is in the audience when Two-Face and his gang try to rob a [[classical music|classical]] concert. Gilda follows Two-Face to his hideout, just as Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] burst in. When Two-Face, having the drop on the Caped Crusader, pulls his gun and opens fire upon his former ally, Gilda leaps in front of the bullet. Pleading to Harvey that she had to make him &quot;understand… before it was too late…&quot;, she passes out, shocking Two-Face into thinking he's killed her. Two-Face turns himself in and Gilda is sent to the hospital.

When Two-Face learns from the doctors that Gilda has lost the will to live, he vows to give up his life of crime. After a final tussle with the last of his men, he undergoes [[plastic surgery]] and is released from jail after one year. His face and sanity restored, Harvey Kent promises to finally marry Gilda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcindexes.com/planet/weeklyplanet.php?issue=1 |title=Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics |publisher=Dcindexes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121115533/http://dcindexes.com/planet/weeklyplanet.php?issue=1 |archivedate=2010-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Superman Family'' #211, Harvey Kent (causing confusion with the name of [[Clark Kent]]) and Gilda attend the wedding of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (the now-retired [[Catwoman]]). It is presumed that this version of Harvey and Gilda live happily ever after.

===Earth-One===
Gilda did not return to comics again until the late 1970s in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #48 (June 1977), page 2, panel 2 where Harlequin ([[Duela Dent]]) claims to be her daughter, conceived apparently during the brief period seen in ''Batman'' #234 where Harvey Dent is cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://titanstower.com/source/whoswho/duela.html |title=Duela Dent |publisher=Titans Tower |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021020718/http://titanstower.com/source/whoswho/duela.html |archivedate=2007-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dent's reversion to Two-Face (also seen in flashback in ''Batman'' #234), Gilda leaves Dent. She is seen carrying baby Duela in one hand and a suitcase in the other.

In ''Batman'' # 328,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfman, Marv(W), Novick, Irv(A), Batman # 328, (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; it is revealed that Gilda remarried Dave Stevens, Harvey Dent's former assistant. Stevens is murdered by Moroni, who is subsequently killed by Two-Face as revenge for causing Gilda pain. Two-Face disguises himself as a man named Carl Ternison and courts the newly widowed Gilda, trying to have a normal life with her.

When Gilda discovers the truth, Two-Face's madness escalates, and he eventually traps Batman inside an abandoned courthouse. However, before he can pull the trigger, Gilda intercedes, swearing that if he kills Batman, she will think of him only as a murderer and never forgive him. She gives him an ultimatum: &quot;Will it be vengeance or hope?&quot; Torn apart, Two-Face breaks down and begs her for help. He is arrested, but Gilda promises to be there for him as long as he wants to get better.

===Post-Crisis===
Her role in Harvey Dent's past was updated into the currently prominent Two-Face origin: ''Batman Annual'' #14 (1990), a story called &quot;Eye of the Beholder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Helfer, Andrew(W), Sprouce, Chris(A), Batman Annual # 14, &quot;Eye of the Beholder,&quot; (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In this story, it is revealed that Dent's father was an [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholic]] who would nightly play a game with his young son: &quot;I'll flip a coin: if it's heads, I beat you. Tails, I don't.&quot; Dent spends a lifetime burying his rage and resentment, only to discover that the coin was two-headed all along. While Dent is torn between loving and resenting his father, Gilda clearly despises him; she scoffs that after a lifetime of abuse and cruelty, the only thing Dent's father ever gave him was a coin.

Gilda tries to comfort Dent as his sanity deteriorates. She pleads with him when, upon awakening from a nightmare, he races out of their bed in the middle of the night and goes to his office, &quot;where it's safe.&quot; After Harvey is disfigured, Gilda visits him in the hospital to try to give him back the coin. It was in his pocket during the trial, and was also hit by some acid, scarring one side of the coin. She last appears in this story right after Two-Face murders his corrupt former assistant, Adrian Fields, tearfully explaining Dent's abuse history to Batman.

Gilda does not reappear until ''[[Secret Origins]] Special'' # 1,&lt;ref&gt;Verheiden, Mark(W), Broderick, Pat(A), &quot;Untitled,&quot; Secret Origins Special # 1 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; where she (here named Grace) appears on a TV talk show focusing on Gotham's villains. She talks about a time when one of the criminals Dent put away as D.A. returned for revenge by taking her hostage. Two-Face eventually rescued her, beating the ex-con to the point of death, but holding off because Grace demanded he stop. This represents a rare case where Two-Face is not influenced by the coin, but rather by someone else's welfare. She tries once again to appeal to his &quot;good&quot; side, but fails. At the end of the interview, she professes her belief that, one day, Dent would return to her.

Gilda returns in ''Batman: Two-Face Strikes Twice.''&lt;ref&gt;arr, Mike W.(W), Stanton, Joe(A), Gross, Derrick(A), &quot;Two-Face Strikes Twice!&quot; (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Here, she finds herself at odds with her now-ex-husband, as he believes their marriage failed because he was unable to give her children. She later marries Paul Janus, a reference to the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of doors who had two faces, one facing forward, the other backward. Two-Face attempts to frame Janus as a criminal by kidnapping him and replacing him with a stand-in, whom Two-Face &quot;disfigures&quot; with makeup to make it look as if Janus has gone insane just as Two-Face had. Two-Face is eventually caught by Batman and sent away, and Gilda and Janus reunite. Years later, Gilda gives birth to twins named James and Luke, prompting Two-Face to escape once more and take the twins hostage, as he erroneously believes them to be conceived by Janus using an experimental fertility drug. The end of the book reveals a surprise twist; Batman learns from Gilda that Janus is not the father of Gilda's twins - Dent is. Some of his sperm had been frozen after a death threat had been made against him, and she used some of it to get pregnant. Batman uses this information to convince Dent to free the twins and turn himself in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/two-face/29-5555/ |title=Two-Face (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Zero Hour===
After the events of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'', Gilda's entire history has been revised. She has a larger role and story arc in ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Joseph, Sale, Tim (w), Sale, Tim (p, i). Batman: The Long Halloween (1996-1997). DC Comics (368). 1563894696.&lt;/ref&gt; a maxi-series that is part of Two-Face's origin in ''Batman Annual'' #14. During the nearly year-long story, a [[serial killer]] called [[Holiday (comics)|Holiday]] systematically murders prominent [[gangster]]s. During the series, Gilda's marriage to Dent shows signs of strain; she wants to settle down and start a family, while he is obsessed with capturing Holiday. In a private monologue at the end, Gilda states that she was the original Holiday killer, having committed all of the murders up until [[New Year's Eve]]. Gilda indicates that Dent murdered [[Alberto Falcone]] on New Year's Eve, taking her place, and that he was the one responsible for the crimes from that point on. The confession is only known to readers, since Alberto confessed to all the Holiday murders upon his capture. Gilda destroys the evidence of her crimes and leaves Gotham City.

Due to the success of ''The Long Halloween'', the events of the story have generally been accepted into continuity as the &quot;official&quot; story of Batman's early years, given that ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' [[retcon]]ned the events of ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'' and rendered them non-[[canon (fiction)|canonical]]. In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the [[Calendar Man]] is about to reveal Holiday's true identity, but an enraged Two-Face cuts him off.

In Greg Rucka's novelization of ''[[Batman: No Man's Land]]'', Dent thinks that Gilda is dead.

===Post Infinite Crisis===
In the &quot;[[One Year Later]]&quot; story arc ''[[Batman: Face the Face]]'', Dent mentions Gilda when recalling his past life, but the Two-Face persona states &quot;No, Harvey. She's gone now&quot;.

During [[Dick Grayson]]'s tenure as Batman, she appears standing over a wounded Harvey Dent. the [[Riddler]] reveals that she faked her death and was institutionalized following ''The Long Halloween'', where she met Mario Falcone, who suffered a similar breakdown following the event of ''Dark Victory''. After getting involved upon their release, Falcone kept Gilda like a prisoner, and she conspired with the Riddler to steal Two-Face's coin and entice him to rescue her. Knowing that Falcone was on Dent's tail, Gilda faked Harvey's death by appearing to shoot him at point-blank range. When they were finally reunited, she explained how much she missed him, and that she now believed in Two-Face as well as Harvey Dent. Feeling betrayed and manipulated, Two-Face tried to kill her, but hesitated, only to be stopped by Batman. To save Harvey, she shot Batman with a .22, knocking him out and allowing them both to escape. Her ultimate fate remains unknown, and Dick even expressed doubt that she was in fact the real Gilda Dent.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #710-712 (May–July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New 52===
In the New 52 reboot, Gilda is a socialite that Bruce Wayne introduces to Harvey at a graduation party. She is killed in front of Harvey by Erin McKillen.

==Other versions==
===''Daredevil: Yellow''===
Gilda has also appeared outside the DC Universe. In [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]]'s [[Marvel Comics]] miniseries, ''Daredevil: Yellow'', a mysterious woman named Grace seeks help from [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Foggy Nelson]]'s [[New York City]] law firm. She claims to be from out of town and has some knowledge of the legal system, saying her husband was a great man and she did terrible things to protect him. The [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] somehow discovers her secret and [[blackmail]]s her into helping him kidnap [[Karen Page]], who pleads with her for help. In a panel that strongly resembles Tim Sale's Gilda Dent, she just says, &quot;Someday you'll have a secret too,&quot; and leaves.

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Harvey Dent has a wife and twin children. When the [[Martha Wayne|Joker]] kidnaps Dent's children, Mrs. Dent is emotional while her husband asks [[Thomas Wayne]] (the Batman of this timeline) for help in their search.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Batman – Knight of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* A character analogous to Gilda, '''Grace Lamont''', appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by Murphy Cross. In the episode &quot;Two-Face&quot;, she is D.A. Harvey Dent's fiancée. Alongside Dent's best friend Bruce Wayne, she watches helplessly as Dent loses his grip on sanity while going after gangster [[Rupert Thorne]]. After Dent is disfigured and becomes [[Two-Face#Television|Two-Face]], Thorne plots to use Grace against his new rival. A couple of Thorne's men disguise themselves as police officers and offer Grace a handheld tracking device, in case Two-Face ever approaches her. Two-Face eventually does, bringing her to his lair and wearing a scarf to cover his scars. She nearly succeeds in persuading Two-Face to reform, when Thorne's men show up, revealing that Grace inadvertently betrayed him. Nevertheless, Grace helps Batman and Two-Face fight off Thorne's men, and remains by his side as he is taken into custody with Thorne.

===Video Games===
* Gilda Dent is briefly mentioned in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' by [[Dr. Hugo Strange]]. During Two-Face's final interview, Hugo claims that Dent always had psychological problems, saying that his wife was often afraid of him.
* While playing the Robin DLC Flip of a Coin in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', Gilda's portrait can be seen hanging on the wall in the mansion where Two-Face is.

===Miscellaneous===
* Grace returned to animated continuity in the comic series ''The Adventures of Batman and Robin'' issues # 1 and # 2, where the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] manipulates Two-Face into thinking that Grace and Bruce are having an affair.&lt;ref&gt;Dini, Paul(W), Templeton, Ty(A), &quot;The Adventures of Batman and Robin,&quot; # 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Two-Face abducts her and tries to kill [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], but is ultimately thwarted when Grace jabs the jagged edge of the scarred coin into the disfigured side of his face. The story ends with the implication that their relationship is now damaged beyond repair.
* Grace appears again in ''The Adventures of Batman and Robin'' issue #22, in which Two-Face's life is thrown into chaos when he loses his coin during an unplanned breakout from [[Arkham Asylum]], and is forced to replace it with a quarter. Little Jonni Infantino, the mastermind behind the breakout, threatens to hurt Grace if Two-Face doesn't provide information on one of Rupert Thorne's thugs, Weird Tony Hendra, whom Two-Face prosecuted as Harvey Dent.

'''Gill-man''', commonly referred to as the '''The Creature''', is the lead antagonist of the [[1954 in film|1954]] black-and-white [[science fiction film]] ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and its two sequels ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Creature Walks Among Us]]'' (1956).

In all three films, [[Ricou Browning]] portrays the Gill-man when he is swimming underwater. In the scenes when the Gill-man is walking on dry land, [[Ben Chapman (actor)|Ben Chapman]] plays the creature in the first film, followed by [[Tom Hennesy]] in the second, and [[Don Megowan]] in the third.

The Gill-man's popularity as an [[icon]]ic monster of cinema has led to numerous [[cameo appearance]]s, including an episode of ''[[The Munsters]]'', the motion picture ''[[The Monster Squad]]'', and a [[Creature from the Black Lagoon: The Musical|stage show]].

===Original===
Producer [[William Alland]] was attending a dinner party during the filming of [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (in which Alland played the reporter Thompson) in 1941 when Mexican cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]] told him about the myth of a race of half-fish, half-human creatures in the Amazon river. Figueroa spoke of a friend of his who disappeared in the Amazon while filming a documentary on a rumored population of fish people. Alland then wrote story notes entitled &quot;The Sea Monster&quot; ten years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mostri&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Ferrari, Andrea| title = Il Cinema Dei Mostri | year = 2003 | pages = 287| isbn = 88-435-9915-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were various designs for the creature. William Alland envisioned the creature as a &quot;sad, beautiful monster&quot; and the [[sculpture]] of it was much like that of an aquatic development of a human. Alland said, &quot;It would still frighten you, but because how human it was, not the other way around&quot;. Originally, the creature's design was meant to incorporate a sleek, feminine [[eel]]-like figure, which did not have as many bumps and gills as the final version. The designer of the approved Gill-man was former [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] illustrator Millicent Patrick, though her role was deliberately downplayed by makeup artist [[Bud Westmore]], who for half a century would receive sole credit for the creature's conception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mostri&quot; /&gt; The Gill-man suit was made from [[airtight]] molded sponge rubber and cost $15,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;suit&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Rouin, Jeff| title = The Fabulous Fantasy Films | year = 1977 | pages = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The underwater sequences were filmed at [[Wakulla Springs]] in North Florida (today a state park), as were many of the rear projection images. Part of the film was shot in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]] on the south side of the river near the foot of the old [[Acosta Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mostri&quot; /&gt; In the underwater scenes, air was fed into the Gill-man suit with a rubber hose.&lt;ref name=&quot;suit&quot; /&gt;

===Biology===
The Gill-man is fully [[amphibian|amphibious]], capable of breathing both in and out of the water. As shown in the first film, it is vulnerable to [[rotenone]]. It also possesses [[superhuman]] strength, which is flamboyantly displayed in the second and third films. It also possesses large, webbed hands with sharp claws on the tip of each finger. The Gill-man's scaly skin is extremely tough, which combined with a fast acting healing factor, allows it to survive wounds which would be fatal to humans, such as gunshots and full [[wikt:immolate|immolation]]. As shown in the third film, the creature has a dormant set of [[lung]]s, should its [[gill]]s be irreparably damaged. The Gill-man is slightly [[photophobia|photophobic]], due to its murky water habitat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trivia&quot; /&gt; 35% of the Gill-man's blood is composed of [[white blood cell|white corpuscles]] lacking a nucleus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trivia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.the-reelgillman.com/trivia/gilltrivia.html | title = The Gill-man's movie trivia | publisher = Ben Chapman Family | accessdate = 6 April 2016 |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===Creature trilogy===
;''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''
The last surviving member of a race of amphibious humanoids which lived during the [[Devonian]] age, the Gill-man (as christened by Dr. Thompson) dwelled in a [[lagoon]] located in a largely unexplored area of the [[Amazon rainforest]]. The creature was apparently known to the natives, as the captain of the boat ''Rita'' mentioned local legends of a &quot;man-fish&quot;.
[[File:Swimminggillman.jpg|200px|thumb|The Gill-man in his natural habitat, as portrayed by Ricou Browning in ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'']]
After having found the fossilized remains of another Gill-man, a [[marine biology]] institute funds an expedition to the Amazon in order to find more remains. Though the Gill-man reacts violently to the intrusion, he develops a soft spot for the team's only female member, Kay and repeatedly tries to abduct her, going as far as building a makeshift dam to prevent their boat from escaping. After having killed numerous members of the expedition, the creature takes Kay to his underwater lair, where he is tracked down by the remaining survivors and riddled with bullets. The creature tries to escape by swimming deep into the lagoon, but dies from his injuries.

;''[[Revenge of the Creature]]''
A year after the events of the first film, the Gill-man is shown to have survived and is captured by different scientists. He is sent to the Ocean Harbor Oceanarium in [[Florida]], and quickly becomes a huge tourist attraction. He is studied by an animal psychologist and his [[ichthyology]] student. The psychologist's attempts at communicating with the Gill-man are hampered by his attraction to his student. The Gill-man breaks free from his tank and escapes into the ocean. It is not long before he begins stalking the ichthyology student and kidnaps her at a boat party. The Gill-man is soon tracked down by police and again gets shot multiple times, forcing him to flee into the ocean. He tries to swim away and supposedly dies from his wounds.

;''[[The Creature Walks Among Us]]''
[[File:Thecreaturewalks.jpg|200 px|left|thumb|The mutated Gill-man, as he appears in ''[[The Creature Walks Among Us]]'', as portrayed by Don Megowan]]
After living for a short while in a [[Florida]] river, the creature is found again, and after a vicious struggle, is accidentally [[Death by burning|immolated]]. The Gill-man's injuries are so severe that his scales and gills fall off, forcing his captors to perform surgery on him to prevent suffocation. [[X-ray]]s on the creature show he has begun developing a land animal's lung structure, so a [[tracheotomy]] is performed, opening an air passage to the lungs, transforming the Gill-man into an air-breathing, nearly human animal. Dressing him in a suit made of sail cloth, the creature is taken to a [[California]] estate where he is imprisoned within an electric fence. Though they initially try to integrate the creature into human society, one of its captors frames it for a murder, and the creature ultimately escapes into the ocean.

===Breck Eisner remake===
Producer [[Gary Ross]] said in March 2007 that the Gill-man's origin would be reinvented, with him being the result of a [[pharmaceutical]] corporation [[pollution|polluting]] the Amazon. &quot;It’s about the [[rainforest]] being exploited for profit,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Cieply |title=On Screens Soon, Abused Earth Gets Its Revenge |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= 2007-03-12 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/movies/12vill.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper&amp;oref=slogin |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, however, the proposed director, [[Breck Eisner]], dropped out of the project. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Billington |title=On Screens Soon, Abused Earth Gets Its Revenge |work=[[firstshowing.net]] |date= 2009-05-27|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/breck-eisner-drops-out-of-creature-from-the-black-lagoon/ |accessdate=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the proposed remake has not been made.

==In literature==

===''Creature from the Black Lagoon'' novelization===
The 1977 [[novelization]] of ''Creature from the Black Lagoon'' by [[Carl Dreadstone]] offers a completely different origin for the Gill-man, who in this version of the story is a [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] giant, almost as big as the ''Rita'' itself, weighing in at 30 tons. This Gill-man is both cold blooded and warm blooded and also has a long whiplike tail. The gigantic creature is dubbed &quot;AA&quot;, for &quot;Advanced Amphibian,&quot; by the expedition team members. After slaying most of the team members, destroying a Sikorsky helicopter, and kidnapping Kay more than once, the creature is killed by the crew of a [[United States Navy]] torpedo boat.

===''Time's Black Lagoon''===
In [[Paul Di Filippo]]'s novel ''Time's Black Lagoon'', the Gill-man is depicted as descending from a race of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] who came to [[Earth]] during the [[Devonian]] period on a giant spaceship called ''The Mother''. The Gill-people have the ability to communicate [[telepathy|telepathically]] among themselves and among the human characters. Alphas such as &quot;Fleshmolders&quot;, &quot;Mudshapers&quot;, and &quot;Fishcallers&quot; are highly telepathic individuals in their tribal communities.

The Creature from the Black Lagoon itself is a degenerate member of this race, descended from an individual who explored deep in the ocean and became exposed to [[archaea|archaebacteria]], becoming deformed and insane, driven to infect others with the disease. Eventually there were no healthy gill-people left, and the race's numbers dwindled over the [[epoch (reference date)|epochs]] to one individual in the 1950s, which is the one that appears in the original film.

==Theme park attraction==
The Gill-man was the star of ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon: The Musical]]'', a live performance show that once added to the [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] theme park in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It  debuted on July 1, 2009, it replaced ''[[Fear Factor Live]]''. It closed down for good on March 9, 2010 and replaced by [[Special Effects Stage]] which opened 3 months later on June 26, 2010.

* In an [[Abbott and Costello]] sketch on TV's ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', the Gill-man appears in a haunted house after [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]] faints at the sight of [[Lou Costello]].
* The Gill-man reappears in [[Fred Dekker]]’s ''[[The Monster Squad]]'', where it shows little interest in human females as opposed to its classic counterpart. Instead, it allies itself with [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[Mummy (undead)|Mummy]] and the [[Werewolf|Wolfman]] in order to secure a magical amulet which will allow them to conquer the world. After snapping the necks of several police-men, the Gill-man is killed by Monster Squad member Horace, who shoots it with a shotgun. For its appearance in ''The Monster Squad'', the Gill-man was redesigned by [[Stan Winston]] in order to merely suggest Milicent Patrick’s original design due to licensing issues. The Gill-man was the first costume portrayal of [[Tom Woodruff, Jr.]] who would later work prominently in the [[Alien (franchise)|Alien film series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winston&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author =  Jody Duncan &amp; James Cameron| title = The Winston Effect: The Art and History of Stan Winston Studio | year = 2007 | pages = | isbn = 1-84576-150-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilles Garnier''' (died 18 January 1573) was a [[France|French]] [[hermit]] and [[cannibalistic]], [[serial murderer]] convicted of being a [[werewolf]].  Alternately known as &quot;The [[Hermit]] of St. Bonnot&quot; and &quot;The [[Werewolf]] of [[Dole, Jura|Dole]]&quot;.

The Werewolf of Dole, 
Gilles Garnier was a reclusive hermit living outside the town of [[Dole, Jura|Dole]] in the [[Franche-Comté]] Province in [[France]]. He had recently been married and moved his new wife out to his isolated home. Being unaccustomed to feeding more than just himself he found it difficult to provide for his wife causing discontent between them. During this period several children went missing or were found dead and the authorities of the Franche-Comté province issued an edict encouraging and allowing the people to apprehend and kill the [[werewolf]] responsible.  One evening a group of workers travelling from a neighbouring town came upon what they thought in the dim light to be a wolf but what some recognised as the hermit with the body of a dead child.  Soon after Gilles Garnier was arrested.

==Confession==
According to his testimony at trial, while Garnier was in the forest hunting one night trying to find food for himself and his wife, a [[Ghost#Terminology|spectre]] appeared to him offering to ease his troubles and gave him an ointment that would allow him to change into the form of a wolf, making it easier to hunt. Garnier confessed to have stalked and murdered at least four children between the ages of 9 and 12. 
In October 1572, his first victim was a 10-year-old girl whom he dragged into a vineyard outside of Dole. He strangled her, removed her clothes, and ate the flesh from her thighs and arms.  When he had finished he removed some flesh and took it home to his wife.  Weeks later Garnier savagely attacked another girl, biting and clawing her, but was interrupted by passersby and fled.   The girl succumbed to her injuries a few days later. In November, Garnier killed a 10-year-old boy, again cannibalising him by eating from his thighs and belly and tearing off a leg to save for later. He strangled another boy but was interrupted for the second time by a group of passersby.  He had to abandon his prey before he could eat from it. In 1572, he attacked brutally an unknown boy who was passing by and cut the boy into half by biting at tearing his belly. In 1573, he strangled a girl, ate her flesh, he tore away her left leg and took it to his wife.     

Garnier was found guilty of “crimes of [[lycanthropy]] and [[witchcraft]]” and [[burned at the stake]] on January 18, 1573. Even though Garnier was burned at the stake, his trial was done by the secular authorities and not by the Inquisition, as superstition was not judged by the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/lea1/append2.htm Lea, Henry Charles. ''A History of the Inquisition of Spain''], vol. 1, appendix 2&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Pedro Antonio Iofreu, ''[http://books.google.ch/books?id=hsbdQDFol9QC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%22canon+episcopi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EFHwTpW9MbD54QS5x_myAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22canon%20episcopi%22&amp;f=false Defensa del Canon Episcopi]'', in Pedro Cirvelo (ed.), ''Tratado en el qual se repruevan todas las supersticiones y hechizerias '' printed by Sebastian de Cormellas (1628)&lt;/ref&gt; More than fifty witnesses deposed that he had attacked and 
killed children in the fields and vineyards, devouring their raw flesh. He was sometimes seen 
in human shape, sometimes as a &quot;[[loup-garou]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;notes by Rev. Montague Summers, in the 1928 and 1948 edition of the Malleus Malefaricum. p.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilles de Montmorency-Laval''' (prob. c. September 1405 – 26 October 1440),&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Matei Cazacu, ''Gilles de Rais'', Paris: Tallandier, 2005, pp.11 ; pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pays de Retz|Baron de Rais]], was a [[knight]] and [[lord]] from [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], [[Anjou]] and [[Poitou]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} François Macé, ''Gilles de Rais'', Nantes: Centre régional de documentation pédagogique de Nantes, 1988, pp. 95–98.&lt;/ref&gt; a leader in the French army, and a companion-in-arms of [[Joan of Arc]]. He is best known for his reputation and later conviction as a confessed [[serial killer]] of children.

A member of the [[House of Montmorency|House of Montmorency-Laval]], Gilles de Rais grew up under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather and increased his fortune by marriage. He earned the favour of the Duke of Brittany and was admitted to the French court. From 1427 to 1435, Gilles served as a commander in the [[French Royal Army|Royal Army]], and fought alongside Joan of Arc against the English and their [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] allies during the [[Hundred Years' War]], for which he was appointed [[Marshal of France]].

In 1434/1435, he retired from military life, depleted his wealth by staging an extravagant theatrical spectacle of his own composition, and was accused of dabbling in the occult. After 1432 Gilles was accused of engaging in a series of child murders, with victims possibly numbering in the hundreds. The killings came to an end in 1440, when a violent dispute with a clergyman led to an ecclesiastical investigation which brought the crimes to light, and attributed them to Gilles. At his trial the parents of missing children in the surrounding area and Gilles' own confederates in crime testified against him. Gilles was condemned to death and hanged at [[Nantes]] on 26 October 1440.

Gilles de Rais is believed to be the inspiration for the 1697 fairy tale &quot;[[Bluebeard]]&quot; (&quot;Barbe bleue&quot;) by [[Charles Perrault]].

==Early life==
Gilles de Rais was probably born in late 1405&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Matei Cazacu, ''Gilles de Rais'', Paris: Tallandier, 2005, p.11 ; 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt; to Guy II de Montmorency-Laval and Marie de Craon in the family castle at [[Champtocé-sur-Loire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Ambroise Ledru, &quot;Gilles de Rais dit Barbe-Bleue, maréchal de France. Sa jeunesse, 1404-1424&quot;, ''L'union historique et littéraire du Maine'', vol. I, 1893, pp. 270–284; {{fr icon}} Matei Cazacu, ''Gilles de Rais'', 2005, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an intelligent child, speaking fluent [[Latin]], illuminating manuscripts, and dividing his education between military discipline and moral and intellectual development.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the deaths of his father and mother in 1415, Gilles and his younger brother René de La Suze were placed under the tutelage of Jean de Craon, their maternal grandfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP35&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean de Craon was a schemer who attempted to arrange a marriage for twelve-year-old Gilles with four-year-old Jeanne Paynel, one of the richest heiresses in [[Normandy]], and, when the plan failed, attempted unsuccessfully to unite the boy with Béatrice de Rohan, the niece to the Duke of [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiPP37–38&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November 1420, however, Craon substantially increased his grandson's fortune by marrying him to Catherine de Thouars of [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], heiress of [[La Vendée]] and [[Poitou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their only child Marie was born in 1429.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP45,102&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=45,102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
[[File:Blason Gilles de Rais.svg|right|thumb|Coat of arms of Gilles de Rais]]

In the decades following the [[Breton War of Succession]] (1341–64), the defeated faction led by Olivier de Blois, Count of Penthièvre, continued to plot against the Dukes of the House of Montfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|pp=22,24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blois faction, who still refused to relinquish their claim to rule over the [[Duchy of Brittany]], had taken [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|Duke John VI]] prisoner in violation of the [[Treaty of Guérande (1365)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixteen-year-old Gilles took the side of the House of Montfort. Rais was able to secure the Duke's release, and was rewarded with generous land grants which were converted to monetary gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1425, Rais was introduced to the court of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] at [[Saumur]] and learned courtly manners by studying the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;At the battle for the [[Château du Lude]] he took prisoner the English captain Blackburn.&lt;ref&gt;Jean de Bueil, ''Le Jouvencel'', Paris, Librairie Renouard, Part 1, 1887, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k331566/f22.image.r pp.XV-XVII] ; Part 2 II, 1889, [https://archive.org/stream/lejouvencelparj00bueigoog#page/n285/mode/2up pp.273-275]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matei Cazacu, ''Gilles de Rais'', Taillandier, 2005, pp.79&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1427 to 1435, Rais served as a commander in the Royal Army, distinguishing himself by displaying reckless bravery on the battlefield during the renewal of the [[Hundred Years War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiPP63–64&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1429, he fought along with [[Joan of Arc]] in some of the campaigns waged against the English and their [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP198&quot; /&gt; He was present with Joan when the [[Siege of Orléans]] ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiPP83–84&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday 17 July 1429, Gilles was chosen as one of four lords for the honor of bringing the [[Holy Ampulla]] from the [[Abbey of Saint-Remy]] to [[Notre-Dame de Reims]] for the consecration of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] as King of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP93&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, he was officially created a [[Marshal of France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP198&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Siege of Orléans, Rais was granted the right to add a border of the royal arms, the [[fleur-de-lys]] on an azure ground, to his own. The letters patent authorizing the display cited Gilles’ &quot;high and commendable services&quot;, the &quot;great perils and dangers&quot; he had confronted, and &quot;many other brave feats&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP101&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1431, Joan of Arc was burned at the stake; Gilles was not present. His grandfather died 15&amp;nbsp;November 1432, and, in a public gesture to mark his displeasure with Gilles' reckless spending of a carefully amassed fortune, left his sword and his breastplate to Gilles' younger brother René de La Suze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=106,123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
In 1434/5, Rais gradually withdrew from military and public life in order to pursue his own interests: the construction of a splendid Chapel of the Holy Innocents (where he officiated in robes of his own design),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production of a theatrical spectacle called ''Le Mistère du Siège d'Orléans''. The play consisted of more than 20,000 lines of verse, requiring 140 speaking parts and 500 extras. Gilles was almost bankrupt at the time of the production and began selling property as early as 1432 to support his extravagant lifestyle. By March 1433, he had sold all his estates in Poitou (except those of his wife) and all his property in Maine. Only two castles in [[Anjou]], [[Champtocé-sur-Loire]] and [[Ingrandes, Maine-et-Loire|Ingrandes]], remained in his possession. Half of the total sales and mortgages were spent on the production of his play. The spectacle was first performed in [[Orléans]] on 8&amp;nbsp;May 1435. Six hundred costumes were constructed, worn once, discarded, and constructed afresh for subsequent performances. Unlimited supplies of food and drink were made available to spectators at Gilles' expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1435, family members gathered to put a curb on Gilles. They appealed to [[Pope Eugene IV]] to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents (which he refused to do) and carried their concerns to the king. On 2&amp;nbsp;July 1435, a royal edict was proclaimed in [[Orléans]], [[Tours]], [[Angers]], [[Pouzauges]] and [[Champtocé-sur-Loire]] denouncing Gilles as a spendthrift and forbidding him from selling any further property. No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him, and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them. Gilles' credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him. He borrowed heavily, using his ''objets d'art'', manuscripts, books and clothing as security. When he left Orléans in late August or early September 1435, the town was littered with precious objects he was forced to leave behind. The edict did not apply to Brittany, and the family was unable to persuade the Duchy of Brittany to enforce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occult involvement==

In 1438, according to testimony at his trial from the priest Eustache Blanchet and the cleric François Prelati, de Rais sent out Blanchet to seek individuals who knew [[alchemy]] and [[Evocation|demon summoning]]. Blanchet contacted Prelati in [[Florence]] and convinced him to take service with his Master.  Having reviewed the [[Grimoire|magical books]] of Prelati and a traveling Breton, de Rais chose to initiate experiments, the first taking place in the lower hall of his castle at [[Tiffauges]], attempting to summon a [[demon]] named Barron. De Rais provided a contract with the demon for riches that Prelati was to give to the demon at a later time.

As no demon manifested after three tries, the Marshal grew frustrated with the lack of results.  Prelati responded that the demon Barron was angry and required the offering of parts of a child. De Rais provided these remnants in a glass vessel at a future evocation. All of this was to no avail, and the occult experiments left him bitter and with his wealth severely depleted.&lt;ref&gt;Bataille, Georges. ''The Trial of Gilles de Rais''. Los Angeles: AMOK, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child killer==
In his confession, Gilles mentioned the first assaults on children occurred between spring 1432 and spring 1433.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP109&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first murders occurred at [[Champtocé-sur-Loire]]; however, no account of these murders survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP112&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Gilles moved to [[Machecoul]] where, as the record of his confession states, he killed, or ordered to be killed, a great but uncertain number of children after he [[sodomy|sodomized]] them.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP112&quot; /&gt; Forty naked bodies of children were discovered in Machecoul in 1437.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP112&quot; /&gt;

The first documented case of child-snatching and murder concerns a boy of twelve called Jeudon (first name unknown), an apprentice to the [[furrier]] Guillaume Hilairet.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP113&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilles de Rais' cousins, Gilles de Sillé and Roger de Briqueville, asked the furrier to lend them the boy to take a message to Machecoul, and, when Jeudon did not return, the two noblemen told the inquiring furrier that they were ignorant of the boy's whereabouts and suggested he had been carried off by thieves at [[Tiffauges]] to be made into a [[Page (occupation)|page]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP113&quot; /&gt; In Gilles de Rais' trial, the events were testified to by Hillairet and his wife, the boy's father Jean Jeudon, and five others from Machecoul.

In his 1971 biography of Gilles de Rais, Jean Benedetti tells how the children who fell into Rais's hands were put to death:

{{quote|text=[The boy] was pampered and dressed in better clothes than he had ever known. The evening began with a large meal and heavy drinking, particularly [[hippocras]], which acted as a stimulant. The boy was then taken to an upper room to which only Gilles and his immediate circle were admitted. There he was confronted with the true nature of his situation. The shock thus produced on the boy was an initial source of pleasure for Gilles.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP113&quot; /&gt;}}

Gilles' bodyservant Étienne Corrillaut, known as Poitou, was an accomplice in many of the crimes and testified that his master stripped the child naked and hung him with ropes from a hook to prevent him from crying out, then [[masturbation|masturbated]] upon the child's belly or thighs. If the victim was a boy he would touch his genitals (particularly testicles) and buttocks. Taking the victim down, Rais comforted the child and assured him he only wanted to play with him. Gilles then either killed the child himself or had the child killed by his cousin Gilles de Sillé, Poitou or another bodyservant called Henriet.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP114&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims were killed by decapitation, cutting of their throats, dismemberment, or breaking of their necks with a stick. A short, thick, double-edged [[sword]] called a ''braquemard'' was kept at hand for the murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP114&quot;/&gt; Poitou further testified that Rais sometimes abused the victims (whether boys or girls) before wounding them and at other times after the victim had been slashed in the throat or decapitated. According to Poitou, Rais disdained the victim's sexual organs, and took &quot;infinitely more pleasure in debauching himself in this manner&amp;nbsp;... than in using their natural orifice, in the normal manner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP114&quot;/&gt;

In his own confession, Gilles testified that “when the said children were dead, he kissed them and those who had the most handsome limbs and heads he held up to admire them, and had their bodies cruelly cut open and took delight at the sight of their inner organs; and very often when the children were dying he sat on their stomachs and took pleasure in seeing them die and laughed”.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP115&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poitou testified that he and Henriet burned the bodies in the fireplace in Gilles' room. The clothes of the victim were placed into the fire piece by piece so they burned slowly and the smell was minimized. The ashes were then thrown into the cesspit, the moat, or other hiding places.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP115&quot; /&gt; The last recorded murder was of the son of Éonnet de Villeblanche and his wife Macée. Poitou paid 20 ''[[Solidus (coin)#France|sous]]'' to have a page's [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] made for the victim, who was then assaulted, murdered and incinerated in August 1440.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP171&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and execution==
On 15 May 1440, Rais kidnapped a cleric during a dispute at the Church of [[Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP168&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WolfP173“&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act prompted an investigation by the [[Bishop of Nantes]], during which evidence of Gilles' crimes was uncovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP168&quot; /&gt; On 29 July, the Bishop released his findings,&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP169&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently obtained the prosecutorial cooperation of Rais's former protector, [[John VI, Duke of Brittany]]. Rais and his bodyservants Poitou and Henriet were arrested on 15 September 1440,&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP176–177&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WolfP178&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a secular investigation which paralleled the findings of the investigation from the Bishop of [[Nantes]]. Rais's prosecution would likewise be conducted by both secular and ecclesiastical courts, on charges which included murder, sodomy and heresy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiPP177,179&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=177, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive witness testimony convinced the judges that there were adequate grounds for establishing the guilt of the accused. After Rais admitted to the charges on 21 October,&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiPP182–183&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court canceled a plan to torture him into confessing.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP184&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants of the neighboring villages had earlier begun to make accusations that their children had entered Gilles' castle begging for food and had never been seen again. The transcript, which included testimony from the parents of many of these missing children as well as graphic descriptions of the murders provided by Gilles' accomplices, was said to be so lurid that the judges ordered the worst portions to be stricken from the record.

The precise number of Gilles' victims is not known, as most of the bodies were burned or buried. The number of murders is generally placed between 80 and 200; a few have conjectured numbers upwards of 600. The victims ranged in age from six to eighteen and included both sexes, but were predominantly boys.

On 23 October 1440, the secular court heard the confessions of Poitou and Henriet and condemned them both to death,&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP189&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Gilles' death sentence on 25 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP189&quot;/&gt; Gilles was allowed to make confession,&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP189&quot; /&gt; and his request to be buried in the church of the monastery of Notre-Dame des Carmes in [[Nantes]] was granted.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP190&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Execution by hanging and burning was set for Wednesday 26 October. At nine o‘clock, Gilles and his two accomplices made their way in procession to the place of execution on the Ile de Biesse.&lt;ref name=&quot;WolfP213&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilles is said to have addressed the crowd with contrite piety and exhorted Henriet and Poitou to die bravely and think only of salvation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP190&quot; /&gt; Gilles' request to be the first to die had been granted the day before.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP189&quot; /&gt; At eleven o'clock, the brush at the platform was set afire and Rais was hanged. His body was cut down before being consumed by the flames and claimed by &quot;four ladies of high rank&quot; for burial.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Several years after Gilles' death, his daughter Marie had a stone memorial erected at the site of his execution. Over the years, the structure came to be regarded as a holy altar under the protection of [[Saint Anne]]. Generations of pregnant women flocked there to pray for an abundance of breast milk. The memorial was destroyed by rioting [[Jacobins]] during the [[French Revolution]] in the late 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP190&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WolfP215&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henriet and Poitou were executed in similar fashion but their bodies were reduced to ashes in the flames and then scattered.&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettiP190&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WolfP215&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WolfP223&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants and Barony of Rais==
Marie de Rais (died 1457) was married first to Prigent VII de Coëtivy (1399–20 July 1450 Cherbourg, France), second to [[André de Laval-Montmorency]] (1408–1486) and had no children from either marriage. After her death the Barony de Rais passed to her uncle René de Rais (1414–1473) and from him to his daughter, Jeanne de Retz (1456–1473), married to Francois de Chauvigny (1430–1491). Their son was André III de Chauvigny (died 1503), who was married to [[Louise de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier]] (1482–1561) and had no children. Louise de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, later married [[Louis, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon]].

==Question of guilt==
Although Gilles de Rais was convicted of murdering many children by his confessions and the detailed eyewitness accounts of his own confederates and victims' parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/rais/execution_13.html |title=Gilles de Rais: The Pious Monster|publisher= The Crime Library|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; doubts have persisted about the court's verdict. Counterarguments are based on the theory de Rais was himself a victim of an ecclesiastic plot or act of revenge by the Catholic Church or French state. Doubts on Gilles de Rais' guilt have long persisted because the Duke of Brittany, who was given the authority to prosecute, received all the titles to Gilles' former lands after his conviction. The Duke then divided the land among his own [[vassal|nobles]]. Writers such as secret societies specialist [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Bayard|Jean-Pierre Bayard]], in his book ''Plaidoyer pour Gilles de Rais'', contend he was a victim of the Inquisition.

In the early 20th century, anthropologist [[Margaret Murray]] and occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] are among those who questioned the involvement of the ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case. Murray, who propagated the [[witch-cult hypothesis]], speculated in her book ''[[The Witch-Cult in Western Europe]]'' that Gilles de Rais was really a witch and adherent of a fertility cult centered on the pagan goddess, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages= 173–174|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20411|title= The Witch-Cult in Western Europe|authorlink=Margaret Murray|first= Margaret|last= Murray|quote= Gilles de Rais was tried and executed as a witch and, in the same way, much that is mysterious in this trial can also be explained by the Dianic Cult|publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeja.org/Murray/index.html &quot;Historical Association for Joan of Arc Studies.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, most historians reject Murray's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, Hugh. ''The European Witch-craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries,'' 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeffrey. ''A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans,'' 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Jacqueline. &quot;Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her and Why?&quot; ''Folkrealllore'' 105, 1994, pp. 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald.

''Witchcraft in Old and New England''. 1951. pp. 275, 421, 565.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Cohn]] argues that her theory does not agree with what is known of Gilles' crimes and trial.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, Norman. ''Europe's Inner Demons''. London: Pimlico, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Keith. ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'', 1971 and 1997, pp. 514–517.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians do not regard Gilles as a [[martyr]] to a pre-Christian religion; other scholars tend to view him as a lapsed Catholic who descended into crime and depravity, whose real crimes caused the land forfeitures.&lt;ref&gt;Barett, W.P. ''The Trial of Joan of Arc''. 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine and Marie Veronique Clin. ''Joan of Arc, Her Story''. 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer, Françoise. ''For Fear of the Fire: Joan of Arc and the Limits of Subjectivity''. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilles was retried during a media event in his home country of France, without any official involvement of the public authorities and the judicial body.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Jost, ''Gilles de Rais'', Marabout, 1995, pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19921111&amp;id=ATkdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5KUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6620,2828943|title=The Tuscaloosa News - Google News Archive Search|date=November 11, 1992|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Freemason]] Jean-Yves Goëau-Brissonnière, the [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Grande Loge de France|Grand Lodge of France]], organized a self-proclaimed &quot;court&quot; consisting of former French ministers, parliament members and UNESCO experts to re-examine the source material and evidence available at the medieval trial. A team of lawyers, writers and politicians led by Gilbert Prouteau and presided over by Judge Henri Juramy found him not guilty, although none of the initiators was a medieval historian by profession. In addition, none of them sought professional advice from certified medievalists.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Kerhervé, « L'histoire ou le roman ? », in ''Le Peuple breton'', n° 347, November 1992, pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Fleury, &quot;Gilles de Rais ou les malheurs de l'Histoire&quot;, ''Bulletin de la Société d'études et de recherches historiques du pays de Retz'', Paimbœuf, Éditions du pays de Retz, n° 13, 1993, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearing, which concluded Gilles de Rais was not guilty of the crimes, was partially turned into a fictionalized biography called ''Gilles de Rais ou la Gueule du loup'', narrated by the writer [[Gilbert Prouteau]]. &quot;The case for Gilles de Rais's innocence is very strong,&quot; Prouteau said. &quot;No child's corpse was ever found at his castle at Tiffauges and he appears to have confessed to escape excommunication...The accusations appear to be false charges made up by powerful rival lords to benefit from the confiscation of his lands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/jun/17/bluebeard-gilles-de-rais-france|title=From the archive, 17 June 1992: Rehabilitation of France's Bluebeard|first=By Paul|last=Webster|date=17 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=16 February 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the journalist Gilbert Philippe from the newspaper ''[[Ouest-France]]'', said that Prouteau was being &quot;facetious and provocative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Philippe, [http://www.ouest-france.fr/2012/08/03/vendee/L-ecrivain-Gilbert-Prouteau-s-est-eteint-a-95-ans-63350035.html « L'écrivain Gilbert Prouteau s'est éteint à 95 ans - Vendée »], in ''Ouest-France'', Friday August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that Prouteau thought the retrial was basically &quot;an absolute joke&quot;. Historians continue to believe him guilty of the crimes, mainly differing as to his motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Jean de Raigniac, book review of Gilbert Prouteau's ''Roman de la Vendée'', in ''Lire en Vendée'', June–December 2010, [http://fr.slideshare.net/ecrivains-vendee/lire-envendeejuindecembre2010 pp.5]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Gin Ichimaru'''|市丸 ギン|Ichimaru Gin}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' created by [[Tite Kubo]]. He was the [[Soul Reaper (Bleach)#Unit Commander|captain]] of the 3rd Division in the [[Soul Reaper (Bleach)#Gotei 13|Gotei 13]] until he betrays [[Bleach (manga)#Plot|Soul Society]], and after that becomes a commander in [[Sōsuke Aizen]]'s arrancar army. Later on, his initial betrayal turns out to be a trick to get close to Aizen, and he attempts to kill him. His lieutenant was [[Izuru Kira]].

==Character outline==
[[File:Ichimarugineyes plateblue.jpg|thumb|left|Gin's noticeably open pale blue eyes.]]
Gin's most prominent characteristic is his expression; with his slitted eyes and ever-present grin, his face looks like that of a fox. Ichigo derisively nicknames him &quot;fox-face&quot; in their first meeting because of this (in the English dub, he instead replies with a more generalized insult). He also has unusual silver hair, which has a purple tint to it in the [[anime]]; his name refers to his hair color, gin &quot;silver&quot;. Gin rarely removes his smile or opens his eyes; his eyes open when he is significantly annoyed, angry or surprised. There are only a few times when he opens his eyes&lt;!--In the story itself; games and other non-plot related incidents are not counted.--&gt;: once in a flashback when he and Aizen rescued [[Momo Hinamori]], [[Izuru Kira]], [[Renji Abarai]], [[Shuhei Hisagi]], and other students from [[Hollow (Bleach)|hollows]], during a battle with 10th Division Captain [[Tōshirō Hitsugaya]], when he got slashed and then killed by [[Aizen Sosuke]] and a further two more times during his fight with [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] after releasing his bankai. His eyes are alternately portrayed in the anime as blood red&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' anime; episode 48&lt;/ref&gt; because his eye color was not yet known. In episode 270, during the special feature at the end, and in episode 300-301, during fight with [[Ichigo Kurosaki]], his eyes are shown as a pale blue color,&lt;ref&gt;As portrayed in ''[[Bleach: The Blade of Fate]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which is the same as the color he had on the manga.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga, Volume 20 cover&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, there are far more moments when he stops smiling, those usually being lesser degrees of annoyance, genuinely apologetic moments, or in deep contemplation over a sudden epiphany.

Gin's constant happy façade tends to have the opposite effect on those he meets, making them instantly distrust him. His use of sarcasm only further encourages this, especially in those who have known him for a long time. Rukia comments on how she felt like snakes were wrapping around her neck whenever Gin spoke, despite the fact that he was speaking to her brother at the time. [[Kaname Tōsen]] notes that Gin has a similar effect on just about everyone when explaining [[Wonderweiss Margera]]'s frightened reaction to Gin. In both manga and anime, Gin speaks with a distinct [[Kansai-ben#Kyoto-ben|Kyoto dialect]], which is indirect and polite. His English dubbed voice is also formal and polite, but with a rather mocking and facetious undertone. Another aspect is his habit of talking with [[Byakuya Kuchiki]], which Rukia believes he did specifically to unsettle her since she was afraid of him.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga; chapter 145 Anime; episode 53&lt;/ref&gt;

After betraying [[Bleach (manga)#Plot|Soul Society]], Gin switches his captain's attire for a similar but unmarked garment. He now wears a long, white robe over his normal Soul Reaper [[hakama]]. The hilt of his ''[[zanpakutō]]'' visibly protrudes from under the robe through the opening down to his waist. Later, Ichimaru is seen wearing a white hakama like the arrancar, instead of the black one he first appears in. Gin wears his robe open in a narrow 'V' down to his waist, closed to below the hips, then open again to the hem, which falls about mid-calf. His robe has long bell sleeves where he hides his hands as is done with kimono sleeves. The lining of the robe and edges or layers of the under-robe(s) appear black. From other examples, it is likely he is also wearing black [[tabi]] with white [[waraji]]. His ''zanpakutō'' is not visible with this outfit. Furthermore, his outfit appears to be similar to Ichigo's while in Bankai.

==History==
Gin saved [[Rangiku Matsumoto]] from death at the hands of some of [[Sōsuke Aizen]]'s minions when they were children, and the two have been good friends since then.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga; Chapter-129 page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Rangiku is the only person Gin seems to truly care about, although he seems to &quot;disappear&quot; often, as Rangiku puts it. Though it's later shown his constant departures were all a part of his patient plan to get revenge against Aizen for ever causing her harm. He also never tells her where he's going without leaving her anything for her to remember him by, something that Rangiku's hated. Though, she also says (after his death) if he'd left anything for her, she'd probably never to be able to move on and he must've known she cared for him too much to do so if he had left anything. Rangiku then says, she loves that about him.

Near the end of the Soul Society arc Gin, who allowed himself to be restrained by Rangiku but manages to get free before leaving with Aizen and Tosen, tells her &quot;Well that's a bit of a let down, I was enjoying that (being in her grip); I wouldn't have minded being your captive a little bit longer. Goodbye, Rangiku, I'm sorry.&quot; implying underlying feelings, this is one of the few times Gin doesn't smile. All of the other times, being in Rangiku's presence, usually when feeling regret or sadness.

After saving Rangiku, Gin secretly swore revenge on Aizen. His unsettling appearance, apparent ruthlessness in battle, and apparent betrayal of the Soul Society were necessary to facilitate this. The first step in his revenge was joining one of the 13 Guardian Divisions. Gin was considered a child prodigy since he graduated from the academy within a year and was assigned to a seated position in the 5th Division.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga; Chapter -105, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Killing the 3rd seat of the division with ease, Gin aroused Aizen's interest in him.&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga; Chapter -105 page 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; He swore his loyalty to Aizen from the day they met, though only so he could discover Aizen's weakness and avenge Rangiku's near death when the time came. Eventually Gin became lieutenant of 5th Division under Captain Sōsuke Aizen.&lt;ref name=&quot;GinLieutenant&quot;&gt;''Bleach'' manga; volume 15 tankōbon, page 176 (chapter -17, page 30)&lt;/ref&gt; As captain he was in command of 3rd Division.

==Synopsis==
Gin's very first appearance is alongside Captain [[Kenpachi Zaraki]] when the two catch and converse with Captain [[Byakuya Kuchiki]] after the latter delivers [[Rukia Kuchiki]]'s sentence. He then appears at the gates leading into the Seireitei on Aizen's orders, repelling both [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] and the gate keeper Jidanbō without killing them, simultaneously closing the gate which Jidanbō was holding open. The other captains question his failure to kill opponents whom he should have had no trouble killing, but a second intrusion by Ichigo's group, followed by the supposed death of Aizen, leaves them with bigger concerns. Aizen, having faked his death, has Gin deliberately cast suspicion on himself, thereby drawing attention away from Aizen's activities. After Aizen's plot is revealed and they retreat to Hueco Mundo, Gin bids Rangiku farewell while apologizing to her.

In Hueco Mundo, Gin jokingly chides Aizen over his habit of playing around with his subordinates. When Ichigo's group breaks into Las Noches, he observes them, even altering the position of the halls when no one is around. When [[Ulquiorra Cifer]] catches him in the act, Gin denies changing anything, saying that he wouldn't do that to &quot;those kids&quot; and that he does not like &quot;sad stories&quot;. He later appears alongside Aizen and Tosen in Karakura Town, commenting on Kira's sudden change in emotion to Tōsen and remarks that he is glad Kira is 'doing well'. After the arrival of the [[Vizards]], Gin mortally wounds [[Hiyori Sarugaki]] when she gave into one of Aizen's taunts and battles Ichigo while Aizen deals with the remaining opposition. Easily overpowering Ichigo, Gin gives him several attempts to run while mocking his inability to defeat Aizen before accompanying his leader to the real Karakura Town.

In Karakura town, Gin is confronted briefly by Rangiku over his motives before immobilizing her to make it appeared that  he killed her when by the time he returns to Aizen's side. After Aizen explains his intent to kill Ichigo's human friends before destroying Karakura town, faking his intent to do the deal for him, Gin uses that moment  to restrain his master's Zanpakutō and pierces him with his own. Though Aizen expected it, Gin reveals his Bankai's true power and uses the blade shard he left in Aizen's body to dissolve most of Aizen's body. Taking the Hogyōku, Gin believed he succeeded until Aizen revives in new form, stating that the Hogyōku is his regardless if it is inside of him or not. Aizen then grievously injures Gin in front of Ichigo's friends as an awakened Rangiku rushes by his side, Gin silently apologizes for being unable to return what Aizen had taken from Rangiku as a child. When Ichigo arrives, a relieved Gin dies seeing the youth to have become strong enough to defeat their mutual enemy.

==Abilities==
[[Image:Shinso.jpg|thumb|Gin uses Shinsō to attack from great distances.]]
Gin Ichimaru's ''[[List of Soul Reapers in Bleach#Characteristics|zanpakutō]]'' is {{nihongo|''Shinsō''|神鎗|Shinsō|literally &quot;God Spear&quot;}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shinsō&quot;&gt;''Bleach'' manga; volume 9 tankōbon, page 103 (chapter 75, page 12)&lt;/ref&gt; It takes the form of a [[wakizashi]] when sealed. The guard is shaped like an 'S'. Shinsō's ''[[List of Soul Reapers in Bleach#Shikai|shikai]]'' is triggered by the phrase {{nihongo|&quot;Shoot to Kill&quot;|射殺せ|ikorose}}; in the anime, this was slightly changed to the declarative ''ikorosu''. In the English translation of the series, the phrase is inconsistent between uses, but mostly describes stabbing (slay, impale, pierce). Another trigger phrase, used in the first Soul Society arc, was &quot;Shoot 'em dead&quot;. Its first rendering in the Viz translation was &quot;skewer that punk&quot;.

In its ''shikai'', Shinsō's blade glows white and extends up to the length of one hundred sword blades and at high speed to impale Gin's opponents. In addition to making it a deadly long-range weapon, the extending blade also carries tremendous force without affecting Gin, making it useful for dislodging heavy objects, as seen when Gin pushes both [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] and the giant Jidanbō out from under the Seireitei gate, despite Jidanbō being firmly braced under it. Once extended, Gin can maintain the blade's length and swing Shinsō in wide arcs, simultaneously attacking multiple targets with speed and ease.

In his rematch with Ichigo he reveals his ''bankai'', {{nihongo|''Kamishini no Yari''|神殺鎗|Kamishini no Yari|literally &quot;God-Slaying Spear&quot;}}. While in ''bankai'', Gin originally said that his blade can extend to up to 13 kilometers or 8.07 miles, making him capable of bisecting a whole block of large buildings with a single swing while far away. The speed at which the sword extends and contracts is originally said to be 500 times the speed of sound (171,500 meters per second), reaching its full length in less than 1/10 of a second, making it the fastest ''zanpakutō''. Gin would downplay the speed of his sword, by instead bragging to his opponent about the length and cutting force, in order to gain a psychological advantage. His ''bankai'''s technique {{nihongo|''Buto''|無踏|Butō|literally &quot;No Step&quot;}} uses his ''zanpakutō''s speed and length properties to an amazing extent. By holding his ''zanpakutō'' to his chest with both hands, the blade extends and contracts at blinding speeds. A form of this technique {{nihongo|''Buto Renjin''|無踏連刃|Butō Renjin|literally &quot;No Step: Serial Blade&quot;}} is the same technique as ''Buto'', but repeats the action in rapid succession many times over, appearing as a wave of blades attacking the opponent. The blade's extension and contraction speed makes the technique so fast, that the individual movements involved are unseen by the opponent, leaving little time for evasion.

When Gin turns on Aizen, he reveals that he lied about his ''bankai'''s length and speed, and that its true power is that it turns into dust for a split moment of the extension/retraction, in which would allow it to release a deadly poison that rests within the interior of the blade into whomever or whatever Gin stabs. Upon the command, {{nihongo|&quot;Kill&quot;|殺せ|Korose}}, the poison activates, dissolving the victim at a cellular level from the inside-out. Gin hid this ability from Aizen for decades, intending to use it to kill the latter after learning the weakness of his ''zanpakutō''.

Before it was revealed in the actual series, various ''Bleach'' console games have depicted Shinsō as having additional abilities. In ''[[Bleach: The Blade of Fate]]'', ''[[Bleach: Dark Souls]]'', ''Bleach: Shattered Blade'', and ''Bleach: The 3rd Phantom'' Gin possess an additional ability known as {{nihongo|''Yarisazame''|槍紗雨|Yarisazame|literally &quot;Gossamer Rain of Spears&quot;}}, activated with the command {{nihongo|&quot;Pour Down&quot;|降り注げ|Furi Sosoge|&quot;Rain&quot; in the English versions}}, where he fires Shinsō into the sky and swords similar to Shinsō's unreleased state rain all around him. In ''[[Bleach: Blade Battlers]]'' Gin shoots Shinsō into the ground and the blade hits the opponent from underneath, whereas in ''[[Bleach: Heat the Soul 5]]'', a wave of blades instead shoots up from the ground to hit the opponent.

==Reception==
Although only heard in two episodes, Gin's &quot;bye bye&quot; has been very popular with audiences.

In both the 2nd and 3rd popularity polls, Ichimaru placed 5th. However, like [[Renji Abarai]], he missed the top 10 of the most recent poll, being replaced with newer characters like [[Grimmjow Jeagerjaques]] and [[Ulquiorra Cifer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bleach'' manga Character Poll; volume 24 tankōbon.&lt;/ref&gt; Gin was among the 4 ''Bleach'' characters to make the top 100 list in ''[[Newtype]]'' Japan's 2007 list of the most popular anime characters.&lt;!-- This needs a magazine issue reference, since we can't link scans.--&gt; Tite Kubo remarked in a 2004 ''Shōnen Jump'' character commentary that Gin's popularity, especially among women, was a great surprise to him, as he had attempted to make Gin creepy and offputting in appearance.&lt;!-- This also needs a magazine issue reference.--&gt;

Critics seem to take note of Gin's &quot;interesting design;&quot; [[IGN]] says he &quot;has always been a rather odd character with his squinty eyes and cheesy smile&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/857/857158p1.html IGN: Gin Ichimaru's Temptation, Resolution Shattered Review]&lt;/ref&gt; and adds &quot;...he can swing a Zanpakutō like it is nobody's business as well, but it is his smile that gets us more than anything else...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/765/765837p1.html IGN: The Man Who Hates Shinigami! Review]&lt;/ref&gt; Another IGN review of ''Bleach'' volume 17 used Gin as an example of ''Bleach''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s colorful and well-developed supporting cast, and remarked that his story would be capable of filling a manga series of its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/761/761593p1.html IGN: Bleach Vol. 17 Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

=== Casting ===
Casting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Isabelle auditioned on the same day as Perkins at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. Screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters when their taped auditions had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/26/ginger_snaps/index.html|title=Ginger Snaps|last=Taylor|first=Charles|date=October 26, 2001|work=salon.com|accessdate=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''What Culture'' said:

: &quot;Obsessed with death and morbidity, and afraid of adulthood, Ginger Fitzgerald, portrayed by Katharine Isabelle of American Mary fame, only gets worse when shes bitten by a lycanthrope and the transformation into a wolf begins. She gradually becomes aggressive and over-sexualised, loses her relationship with her sister, grows pointy teeth and sprouts hair in really weird places. She even grows a tail that she actually attempts to cut off. It takes a big set of cojones to try to cut off any body part. Ultimately though, the film is interesting because it examines the dichotomy between Gingers humanity and her animalistic side.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-badass-female-horror-villains?page=5|title=10 Badass Female Horror Villains|last=|first=|date=|website=What Culture|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica Roakes of ''The Toast'' also mentions the metaphorical nature of the character saying &quot;Ginger’s body has betrayed her by menstruating. This is a key tenant of the body-horror genre — the monstrous comes not just from the outside, but from within the human body, from infection or perversion or unwanted biological functions. In Ginger’s case, it is her metamorphosis from girl to woman that renders her monstrous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-toast.net/2014/10/29/ginger-snaps-menstrual-horror-movie-dreams/|title=Ginger Snaps: The Menstrual Horror Movie Of Your Dreams|last=|first=|date=|website=The Toast|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">'''Giovanna Bonanno''' (c. 1713 – 30 July 1789) was an alleged Italian [[witch]] and professional [[poison]]er.

Little is known of Giovanna Bonanno's early life, though she is believed to have been the same woman as Anna Panto, mentioned in 1744 as the wife of one Vincenzo Bonanno. She was a [[beggar]] in [[Palermo, Sicily]] in the reign of [[Domenico Caracciolo]], [[List of viceroys of Sicily|Viceroy of Sicily]] (term 1781–1786). During her trial, she confessed to being a poisoner, and that she sold poison to women who wanted to murder their husbands. The typical client was a woman with a lover; she bought the first dose to give her husband stomach pains, the second to get him to [[hospital]], and the third to kill him. The [[Physician|doctor]] was, in these cases, unable to ascertain the cause of the deaths. In the Ziza quarter in Palermo, several suspicious cases had occurred. The wife of a [[baker]], a [[Nobility|nobleman]] who had wasted his family's fortune, and another baker's wife (who was thought to have had an affair with a gardener) had all become ill.

One day, a friend of Bonanno, Maria Pitarra, was delivering a poison when she realized that the victim was to be the son of a friend, and decided to warn the mother. The mother made an order for the poison herself, and when Bonanno arrived, she was arrested. The trial opened in October 1788. Bonanno was accused of sorcery. Some of the apothecaries who were selling her potions were called to testify. She was executed by hanging on 30 July 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Fiume  | first = Giovanna  | editor-last = Levack  | editor-first = Brian P.  | chapter = The Old Vinegar Lady  | title = New Perspectives on Witchcraft, Magic, and Demonology: Witchcraft in the Modern World  | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]  | year = 2001  | pages = 261–283  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dxzIIldBB1gC&amp;pg=PA261  | isbn =0-8153-3670-5

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3314">'''Giovanni Andrea Lampugnani''' (died 26 December 1476) was a member of the [[Milan]]ese nobility and an assassin of [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]], the [[Duke of Milan]].

The Lampugnani family was a high-ranking family in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] Milan, and Giovanni served in several government positions, often working quite closely with the Duke.  Under the Duke, Giovanni's brothers leased some valuable land from a rural [[abbey]].  Upon the death of the abbot, the inheriting cleric nullified the lease and evicted the Lampugnani brothers from the property.  Although the family appealed to the Duke, there was no government intervention on the matter, resulting in utter contempt on the part of Giovanni.

The Duke, although popular as a patron of the arts, was known to be rather ruthless in his rule and something of a womaniser, traits which encouraged more enemies to emerge amongst the government ranks.  Two other officials, [[Carlo Visconti]] and [[Gerolamo Olgiati]] soon joined Giovanni in a conspiracy to assassinate the Duke.

== Assassin ==
[[Image:Frontespizio Lamento del duca Galeazzo Maria -Sforza, 1444-1473-, 1476.jpg|thumb|Lament of the duke Galeazzo Maria (1476).]]
Despite evidence that plotting may have begun as early as 1474, there was little planning on the conspirators' part beyond the actual assassination; no efforts were made to find further outside support amongst any ruling families, nor were getaway plans solidified.

Lampugnani, the leader of the plot, gathered with the other conspirators in the church of [[Basilica di Santo Stefano Maggiore|Santo Stefano]] on 26 December 1476 (the day of the martyr, Santo Stefano) to prepare for the assassination.  Armed and wearing hidden armour, they convened before Mass in the morning, praying for the saint's protection.

When the Duke's procession arrived, Lampugnani, Visconti and Olgiati stepped before the Duke, Lampugnani going down on one knee.  After a brief exchange of words, Lampugnani rose suddenly, stabbing the Duke in the groin and chest.  Soon he was joined by Visconti, Olgiati and a servant of Lampugnani's named [[Franzone]], stabbing the Duke to death.

Pandemonium erupted quickly, as the congregation — assassins included — fled the church.  Lampugnani, in an attempt to escape, ran to the women's side of the church where he was subsequently caught and killed.  His head was severed and, with the heads of other assassins (who were all apprehended and executed within a week), displayed on the belltower as a warning for several years following.

In the days immediately following the Duke's assassination, other Lampugnani family members were arrested on suspicion of compliance and much of their property destroyed by mobs.  Most of the remaining Lampugnani fled Milan or were exiled to other cities.

'''Giovanni Brusca''' (born 20 February 1957 in [[San Giuseppe Jato]]) is a former member of the [[Sicilian Mafia]]. He murdered the anti-Mafia prosecutor [[Giovanni Falcone]] in 1992 and once stated that he had committed between 100 and 200 murders but was unable to remember the exact number. He was sentenced to life in prison ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', captured in 1996 and started to cooperate with the authorities.

A pudgy, bearded and unkempt mafioso, Brusca was known in Mafia circles as ''&quot;U' Verru&quot;'' (in Sicilian) or ''Il Porco'' or ''Il Maiale'', (In Italian: The Pig, The Swine) or &quot;lo scannacristiani&quot; (people-slayer; in Italian dialects the word &quot;christians&quot; often stands for &quot;human beings&quot;). [[Tommaso Buscetta]], the Mafia turncoat who had cooperated with Falcone’s investigations, remembered Giovanni Brusca as &quot;a wild stallion but a great leader.&quot;&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/international/1996/960603/covereur.html &quot;The Pig&quot; is Penned], Time Magazine, June 3, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mafia career==
[[Image:Bernardo Brusca.jpg|thumb|Giovanni’s father Bernardo Brusca, [[capo mandamento]] of [[San Giuseppe Jato]] wearing the traditional coppola  – a symbol of the Mafia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,230391,00.html Head to head with Cosa Nostra], The Guardian, February 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Brusca had been in prison since 1985 serving several life sentences. He died of a heart attack at 72 on 8 December 2000. He had been ill for some time. Brusca eventually forgave his sons Giovanni and Enzo for collaborating with the Italian authorities, telling his lawyer at one of their last meetings: &quot;I'm an old man. I don't count for anything. But they made the right choice.&quot; ]]

Born in [[San Giuseppe Jato]]. His grandfather and great-grandfather, both farmers, were made members of [[the Mafia]]. His father [[Bernardo Brusca]], a local Mafia patriarch, served concurrent life sentences for numerous homicides. Bernardo Brusca allied himself with the [[Corleonesi]] of [[Salvatore Riina]] and [[Bernardo Provenzano]] when he replaced [[Antonio Salamone]] as [[capo mandamento]] of San Giuseppe Jato, paving the way for his three sons’ careers – apart from Giovanni, his younger brother Vincenzo and elder brother Emanuele.

By the age of 20, Brusca was reportedly working as a driver for [[Bernardo Provenzano]]. &quot;All the [[pentito|pentiti]] have described him as a kind of butcher with a lot of instinct and little charisma,&quot; says longtime Mafia observer [[Francesco La Licata]], a journalist working for [[La Stampa]] newspaper. Giovanni Brusca became part of a Corleonesi death squad which reported directly to Riina. He became capo mandamento of San Giuseppe Jato after the arrest of his father in 1989.

==Ruthless killer==
An example of Brusca's ruthlessness was the kidnapping and murder of 11-year-old [[Giuseppe Di Matteo]]. The boy's father, [[Santo Di Matteo]], took part in the 1992 Falcone killing and, following his arrest, under the [[pentito]] system named others involved in the plot. Brusca had the boy kidnapped in November 1993. According to the confession of one of the kidnappers, [[Gaspare Spatuzza]], they dressed as police officers and told the boy he was being taken to see his father, who at that time was being kept under police protection on mainland Italy.&lt;ref name=rep160112&gt;{{it icon}} [http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/01/16/news/uccisero_il_piccolo_giuseppe_di_matteo_cinque_ergastoli_per_i_boss_di_cosa_nostra-28229864/ &quot;Uccisero il piccolo Giuseppe Di Matteo&quot;], La Repubblica, January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Instead they held the boy for 26 months, during which time they tortured him and sent grisly photos to his father in an attempt to force him to retract his testimony.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Di Matteo made a desperate trip to Sicily to try to negotiate his son's release but the boy was finally strangled on the orders of Brusca.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, ''The Antimafia'', p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently he had the body dissolved in a barrel of acid to prevent the family being able to mourn at a proper funeral. This deliberate act of concealing or destroying the victim's body is known colloquially as ''[[lupara bianca]]''. It also hinders investigation by destroying evidence.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Brusca once had to face Di Matteo, in court. Di Matteo told the judge: &quot;I guarantee my collaboration but to this animal I guarantee nothing. If you leave me alone with him for two minutes I'll cut off his head.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/brusc/brusc/brusc.html Di Matteo assale Brusca: &quot;Animale, ti stacco la testa&quot;], La Repubblica, September 15, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,666788,00.html Freed mafia grass a marked man], The Guardian, March 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Giovanni Brusca was one of the most powerful Mafia leaders between Riina’s arrest in January 1993 and his own in May 1996. He was involved in the campaign of terror in 1993 against the state to get them to back off in their crackdown against the Mafia after the murders of Anti-mafia magistrates [[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]]. Following the months after Riina's arrest, there were a series of bombings by the Corleonesi against several tourist spots on the Italian mainland – the Via dei Georgofili in [[Florence]], Via Palestro in [[Milan]] and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in [[Rome]], which left 10 people dead and 71 injured as well as severe damage to centres of cultural heritage such as the [[Uffizi]] Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.almanaccodeimisteri.info/autobombecronologia.htm Autobombe del 1993 cronologia dei principali avvenimenti]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
[[Image:Giovanni Brusca arrest.jpg|thumb|Giovanni Brusca in the custody of masked Italian police officers in 1996]]
On 20 May 1996, then aged thirty-nine, Brusca was arrested in a small house in the Sicilian countryside near [[Agrigento]], where he was dining with his girlfriend, their young son and his brother Vincenzo, his sister-in-law and their two children.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960521/ai_n14039775 Italian police arrest the Mafia's 'boss of bosses'], The Independent, 21 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The investigators were able to pinpoint their exact location when the noise of a plainclothes officer driving by the house on a motorbike was picked up by officers listening to a call intercepted on Brusca's mobile phone.&lt;ref name=nyt220596&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900EEDB1039F931A15756C0A960958260 Fugitive Mafia Boss Arrested By the Italian Police in Sicily], The New York Times, May 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

When Brusca was hurried into Palermo's police station some 90 minutes after the arrest, dozens of police officers cheered, honked their horns and embraced each other. As the scruffy-bearded Brusca emerged from a car, clad in dirty jeans and a rumpled white shirt, some ripped off their ski masks, as if to say they no longer had anything to fear from the Mafia. One reportedly managed to slip past guards and punched Brusca in the face.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

Brusca had received a life sentence the previous year after being convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' of murder and he was subsequently convicted of the bomb attack that killed the Anti-Mafia [[magistrate]] [[Giovanni Falcone]] near [[Capaci]]. In court Brusca admitted detonating the bomb, planted under the motorway from the airport to Palermo, by remote control while watching the [[magistrate]]’s convoy through binoculars from a hill.&lt;ref name=tim141004&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article494009.ece Mafia 'Butcher' talks his way out of life behind bars], The Times, October 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborating with Italian justice==
After his arrest Brusca started to collaborate. Initially, his collaboration met with scepticism, fearing his 'repentance' could be a ruse to escape the harsh prison terms reserved for ranking Mafia bosses.&lt;ref name=nyt240896&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E5D91639F937A1575BC0A960958260 Italy Treats a Top Mafia Leader's Repentance With Caution], The New York Times, August 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Under question was whether the state should offer not only protection but also a salary and the promise of judicial leniency to a man nicknamed &quot;U Verru&quot; (&quot;The Pig&quot;), who had punished a Mafia [[pentito]] by dissolving the body of his 11-year-old son in an acid bath. In the first three months, much of what Brusca said turned out to be either unverifiable or false, and a growing chorus of politicians called for a tightening of the collaboration system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970502/ai_n14108177 Backlash threatens to silence informers], The Independent, 2 May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having confessed numerous murders and other criminal activities, he was not granted the status of full collaborator until February 1999. Until that time Brusca was described as a ''dichiarante'', or talking witness. Although much of his evidence eventually was judged to be credible, suspicions remained that his collaboration was part of a strategy to emasculate other [[pentito|pentiti]] and subvert the course of justice.

Brusca has offered a controversial version of the [[Salvatore Riina#Controversy about Riina's arrest|capture of Totò Riina]]: a secret deal between [[Carabinieri]] officers, secret agents and Cosa Nostra bosses tired of the dictatorship of the Corleonesi. According to Brusca, [[Bernardo Provenzano]] &quot;sold&quot; Riina in exchange for the valuable archive of compromising material that Riina held in his apartment in Via Bernini 52 in Palermo. Brusca also claimed that Riina had told him that after the assassination of Falcone, he had been in indirect negotiations with interior minister [[Nicola Mancino]] on a deal to prevent any further killings. Mancino later said this was not true,&lt;ref&gt;Folain, ''Vendetta'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; but in July 2012, Mancino was ordered to stand trial for withholding evidence on 1992 talks between the Italian state and the Mafia and the killings of Falcone and Borsellino.&lt;ref name=adn250712&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Aki/English/Politics/Italy-Ex-interior-minister-implicated-in-mafia-negotiations_313538879018.html Italy: Ex-interior minister implicated in mafia negotiations], AND Kronos International, 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it was reported that Brusca was allowed out of prison for one week every forty-five days to see his family, a reward for his good behaviour as well as becoming an informant and co-operating with the authorities. Relatives of his many victims were angry at such seemingly soft treatment for a multiple-killer.&lt;ref name=tim141004/&gt;

==Assets confiscated==
The Brusca family land was seized by the government and in 2000, handed over to an organization called the [[Consortium for Legal Development]]. It restores property confiscated from imprisoned mafiosi and gives them back to the community. The small stone farmhouse at [[San Giuseppe Jato]] 40 minutes from [[Palermo]] was renovated in 2004. It is Sicily’s first anti-mafia agriturismo – or farmstay. Tourists can enjoy organic pasta milled from wheat grown on Brusca’s land and organic wine made from his vineyards by the [[Placido Rizzotto]] cooperative, named after the union leader from [[Corleone]], who was shot by the mafia in 1948.&lt;ref name=brusca1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3790401.stm Sicily offers safe taste of mafia life], BBC News, June 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brusca2&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2275546,00.html Giving Mafia Property a Makeover in Sicily], Deutsche Welle, December 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Lucio Guarino]], the organization’s director, returning the properties sends a powerful message: &quot;The Brusca family controlled the fortunes of this territory for nearly thirty years. So it’s an incredible symbol. Here land equals power. And this project shows that with the will of the people, it’s possible to confiscate and restore mafia land&quot;.&lt;ref name=brusca2/&gt; It has not been easy reclaiming confiscated mafia land for the community. The first year after the cooperative had just sowed their crops, a flock of sheep came from nowhere to destroy them. The day before the project's first grain harvest, every combine harvester in the area mysteriously disappeared.&lt;ref name=brusca1/&gt;

'''Giovanni Passannante''' ({{IPA-it|dʒoˈvanni ˈpassanˈnantɛ}}; February 19, 1849 – February 14, 1910) was an [[Italians|Italian]] Republican who attempted to assassinate king [[Umberto I of Italy]], the first attempt against [[House of Savoy|Savoy monarchy]] since its origins.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Galzerano, ''Giovanni Passannante'', Galzerano Editore, Casalvelino Scalo, 2004, p.567-568&lt;/ref&gt; Originally condemned to death, his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. The conditions of his imprisonment drove him insane and have been denounced as inhumane.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Salvia di Lucania]] ([[Basilicata]]), from Pasquale and Maria Fiore, he was the younger of ten children, four of whom died in early age. Grew up in a poor family, he was forced to work since  a child as a laborer and a guardian of flocks and was able to attend school only for a short time. Later, Passannante moved to [[Vietri di Potenza|Vietri]] and after to [[Potenza]] working as a scullion in an [[osteria]]. 

He met a captain of the [[Royal Italian Army|royal army]] who, noticing the boy's interest for studies, brought Passannante along with him in [[Salerno]] and gave him an annuity to allow a higher schooling.  Passannante spent his free time reading the [[Bible]] and [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s writings, which brought him closer to [[Republicanism|republican]] ideas.

Passannante became involved in Mazzinian circles and began to have his first troubles with the law. In a night of May 1870, he was discovered and arrested by police guardians of public safety while posting revolutionary proclamations against monarchies and popes, as well as celebrating the Universal Republic, Mazzini and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. After two months in jail, he returned in his hometown, then in Potenza working as a cook. In 1872, he returned in Salerno, continuing his job. In June 1878, Passannante moved to [[Naples]], where he lived from day to day changing various employers.

===Attempted murder===
[[File:Attent-passanante.gif|right|thumb|220px|Passannante attacking the king]]
After the death of his father [[Victor Emmanuel II]], Umberto I prepared a tour in the major cities of Italy to show himself as the new sovereign. He was accompanied by his wife [[Margherita of Savoy|Margherita]] and the prime minister [[Benedetto Cairoli]]. The royal cortege planned to visit Naples, although there was a heated argument in the city council about the high cost that would be incurred on its reception. 

On November 17, 1878 Umberto I and his court were parading in Naples. Passannante was among the crowd, waiting for the right moment to act. While the king was on &quot;Largo della Carriera Grande&quot;, he approached his carriage, faking a supplication; suddenly, he pulled out a knife and attacked him yelling: «Long live [[Felice Orsini|Orsini]]! Long live the Universal Republic!».&lt;ref&gt;Galzerano, p.396&lt;/ref&gt;

Umberto I managed to deflect the weapon, receiving a slight wound on his arm. Queen Margherita threw a bouquet of flowers in his face and shouted: «Cairoli, save the king!».&lt;ref&gt;George Boardman Taylor, ''Italy and the Italians'', America Baptist publication society, 1898, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Cairoli took him by his hair but the prime minister was wounded in his leg. Passannante was hit in the head with a saber by Stefano De Giovannini, captain of the [[cuirassiers]], and was arrested. He tried to kill the king with a knife of 8 centimeters that he traded for his jacket. The weapon was wrapped in a red rag on which was written: «Death to the King! Long live the Universal Republic! Long live Orsini!».&lt;ref&gt;Galzerano, p.396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The attempted regicide shocked the entire nation, and the government feared an anarchist conspiracy. Passannante's action brought disorders in many cities, with a total of several dead, wounded, and arrested. On November 18 of the same year, in [[Florence]], a group of anarchists threw a bomb into a crowd that was celebrating the king's survival. Two men and one girl were killed, and over ten people were injured. Another bomb exploded in [[Pisa]] with no casualties, and in [[Pesaro]] a barrack was assaulted. 

Some republicans such as Alberto Mario condemned his action. The poet [[Giovanni Pascoli]], during a [[socialist]] reunion in [[Bologna]], gave a public reading of his ''Ode to Passannante'' of which there is no trace anymore because Pascoli destroyed it immediately after his reading.&lt;ref&gt;Galzerano, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; Only the last verse is known, of which this paraphrase has been handed down: &quot;''Con la berretta d'un cuoco faremo una bandiera''&quot; (With the cook's cap, we'll make a flag).&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Bulferetti, ''Giovanni Pascoli. L'uomo, il maestro, il poeta'', Milano, Libreria Editrice Milanese, 1914, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrest of some anarchists who protested against Passannante's detention, Pascoli and group of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalists]] protested against the verdict, and the poet shouted: «If these are evil-doers, then long life to evil-doers!».&lt;ref&gt;Indro Montanelli, ''Storia d'Italia, Volume 33'', Rizzoli, 1977, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Pascoli and the internationalists were arrested. 

Some newspapers directed baseless charges against Passannante: Verona's ''[[L'Arena]]'' and Milan's ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' portrayed him as a brigand who had killed a woman in the past, while in a lithograph published in [[Turin]] it was reported that his father was a [[Camorra|camorrista]].&lt;ref&gt;Galzerano, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the attempted murder, Cairoli's government was strongly accused of inability to maintain public order, and, after a rejected motion of confidence presented by the minister [[Guido Baccelli]], Cairoli resigned.

Passannante's family was jailed; only his brother was able to escape. Giovanni Parrella, mayor of Salvia di Lucania, went to Naples to apologize and ask for a pardon from Umberto I. In a sign of forgiveness, on order of the monarch's counselors, Passannante's hometown was forced to change its name to Savoia di Lucania, by a royal decree on July 3, 1879.

===Sentence and death===
[[File:Proc-passanante.gif|left|thumb|220px|Trial of Passannante]]
During the trial, held on March 6 and 7 1879, Passannante stated that he had acted alone. He claimed that the ideas of Risorgimento had been betrayed and that the government was indifferent to the impact on already poor people of increases in the flour tax. Passannante was sentenced to death on March 29, 1879, although capital punishment was expected only in instances of actual regicide. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 

He was imprisoned in [[Portoferraio]] on the island of [[Elba]], off the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] coast, in a small and dark cell below sea level, with no toilet facilities and in complete isolation. His mental condition deteriorated in these harsh conditions of solitary confinement and reportedly he was brutally tortured. He fell ill with [[scurvy]], became infested with [[taenia solium]] and lost body hair. His skin became discolored and his eyes were affected by the lack of light. According to later testimony he came to eat his own feces.&lt;ref&gt;Galzerano, 642&lt;/ref&gt; Seamen sailing near his prison heard Passannante’s screams. 

In 1899, the parliamentarian [[Agostino Bertani]] and the journalist [[Anna Maria Mozzoni]] reported Passannante’s maltreatment, causing a scandal. After an examination of the prisoner by Professors Serafino Biffi and Augusto Tamburini, who found him in very poor condition, the anarchist was transferred to the asylum of [[Montelupo Fiorentino]]. The physicians there were unable to reverse his mental and physical deterioration. Passannante died in Montelupo Fiorentino, at the age of 60.

===Post mortem===
After his death, his corpse was beheaded, and his head and brain became subject of the study of criminologists, under the theories of anthropologist [[Cesare Lombroso]]. In 1935, his brain and skull, preserved in [[formaldehyde]], were sent to the Criminal Museum in [[Rome]], where they were displayed for over 70 years. 

The permanence of the remains at the Museum ranked as one of Italy’s more macabre showcases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/12/world/europe/12italy.html|title= Anarchist’s Head Is Finally Buried, but Outcry Arises Over Timing |author= Peter Kiefer|date= 12 May 2007|work= |publisher= nytimes.com|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing protests and parliamentary questions. In 1998, the then Italian Minister of Justice, [[Oliviero Diliberto]], authored a decree allowing for the displacement of his remains to Savoia di Lucania, but it wasn't acted on until 2007. Passannante's skull and brain remained in the museum, in a neon-lit display case. 

On the night of May 10, 2007, the remains of Passannante were taken to Savoia di Lucania and buried secretly, with the presence only of Rosina Ricciardi, major &lt;!-- &quot;mayor&quot;, maybe? --&gt; of the town; an undersecretary of Vito De Filippo, governor of Basilicata; and a journalist of &quot;La Nuova Del Sud&quot;. Some say it was recommended by monarchists because they didn't want him to receive any publicity. On June 2 of that year there was a mass in memory of the deceased, in the mother church of the town.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6299">'''Giovanni Preziosi''' (24 October 1881 in [[Torella dei Lombardi]] – 26 April 1945 in [[Milan]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[fascism|fascist]] politician noted for his [[antisemitism]].

== Early career ==
Born into a middle-class family, he joined the priesthood after completing his studies and, although he was defrocked in 1911, he remained a lifelong adherent of [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem1&quot;&gt;Richard S. Levy, ''Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 2'', 2005, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; He then followed a career in [[journalism]], founding the ''Vita Italian all'estero'' as a magazine for emigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem1&quot;/&gt; This was followed by his journal ''La Vita Italiana'', which was noted for its antisemitism in the run-up to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolte|first=Ernst|title=[[Three Faces of Fascism]]: Action Française, Italian fascism, National Socialism|year=1969|publisher=Mentor|location=New York|authorlink=Ernst Nolte|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became involved in [[right-wing]] politics, eventually becoming a member of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s fascists and taking part in the [[March on Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem1&quot;/&gt;

== Antisemitism ==
Preziosi was not initially an anti-Semite but after Italy's poor returns for the involvement in the First World War he came to blame the [[Jew]]s for the country's ills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem2&quot;&gt;Levy, ''Antisemitism'', p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; He accused the Jews of being incapable of being fully Italian due to what he considered to be their &quot;double loyalties&quot; and the growth of [[Zionism]] and believed in the notions of a conspiracy between the Jews, [[communism]], [[Freemasonry]], [[capitalism]] and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem2&quot;/&gt; Much of his thought was derived from ''La Libre Parole'', a newspaper founded by [[Edouard Drumont]], [[Howell Arthur Gwynne]]'s ''[[The Cause of World Unrest]]'' and ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' of [[Henry Ford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem2&quot;/&gt; He became the first to translate ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' into [[Italian language|Italian]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;R.J.B. Bosworth, ''The Oxford Handbook of Fascism'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the strength of his conviction that Preziosi even attacked fellow anti-Semite [[Paolo Orano]] for his 'soft' stance on Jews.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Roberts, ''The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism'', 1979, pp. 324-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, although a hardliner in terms of his fascism, he denounced [[Nazism]] as parochial, exclusionary and responsible for pushing Europe towards communism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-45'', Routledge, 1995, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; In fact in his early years he had demonstrated a strong [[Germanophobia]], even producing a book entitled ''Germania alla Conquista dell'Italia'' in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley Feinstein, ''The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-Semites'', 2003, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1933 onward, he changed tack, becoming a strong advocate of close co-operation with the equally anti-Semitic [[Nazi Germany]] and occasionally criticised [[Italian fascism]] for its lack of emphasis on [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem2&quot;/&gt; His views reached a wider audience after the passing of the 1938 Racial Laws as he began to write virulently anti-Semitic articles for the national press as well as his own journal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem2&quot;/&gt;

Preziosi also wrote &quot;''Ecco il diavolo: Israele''&quot;.

== Later career ==
Preziosi growing prestige was rewarded in 1942 when he was made a minister of state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem2&quot;/&gt; Following the formation of the puppet state of [[Italian Social Republic]] Preziosi was initially moved to [[Germany]] where he was to serve as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s adviser on Italian affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antisem2&quot;/&gt; Whilst in Germany he also had a show on Radio Munich, which was broadcast to Mussolini's Italy, and used it as a platform to attack the likes of [[Guido Buffarini Guidi]] and [[Alessandro Pavolini]] as &quot;Jew lovers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Moseley, ''Mussolini: The Last 600 days of Il Duce'', 2004, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Italy in March 1944 to head up an ''Ispettorato Generale della Razza'' (General Inspectorate of Race).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolte|first=Ernst|title=[[Three Faces of Fascism]]: Action Française, Italian fascism, National Socialism|year=1969|publisher=Mentor|location=New York|authorlink=Ernst Nolte|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this role he introduced a system based on the [[Nuremberg Laws]] and used the new code to attack the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, ''Mussolini'', pp. 118-9&lt;/ref&gt; Along with fellow anti-Semite [[Roberto Farinacci]] he also became a close ally of [[Julius Evola]] during this period in a pro-Nazi alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Gregor, ''Mussolini's Intellectuals: Fascist Social and Political Thought'', 2004, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Preziosi's activities were at times frustrated by Mussolini, who nursed a long-standing personal hatred for this &quot;former priest&quot;, but Preziosi's efforts still ensured that the puppet Italian state would be involved in [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;A. James Gregor &amp; Allesandro Campi, ''Phoenix: Fascism in Our Time'', 2001, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the war Preziosi, rather than let himself be captured and killed by partisans (as Mussolini, Pavolini, Farinacci, and so many other RSI leaders had been), committed [[suicide]] by jumping from a high window.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette, ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy'', 2002, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Some, however, have suggested that Preziosi was pushed out of the window.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Giulia Tofana''' (also spelled '''Toffana''', '''Tophana''') (died in Rome, July 1659) was an Italian professional poisoner. She was famous for selling poison to women who wanted to murder their husbands. She was the inventor of the famous poison [[Aqua Tofana]], which is named after her.

== Biography ==

The information about her background is sparse. She was possibly the daughter of Thofania d'Adamo, who was executed in [[Palermo]] on 12 July 1633, accused of having murdered her husband Francis. Tofana was described as beautiful, and she spent a lot of time with apothecaries, was present when they made their potions, and eventually developed her own poison, Aqua Tofana. It is, however, also possible that it was her mother, Thofania d'Adamo, who made the poison and passed the recipe on to her daughter. She began to sell this poison to women who wanted to become widows. Her daughter, [[Girolama Spera]], was also active in this. She eventually moved her business to [[Naples]] and [[Rome]].

Giulia was sympathetic to the low status of women and most often sold her poison to women trapped in difficult marriages. She became known as a friend to the troubled wife and received many referrals.

Tofana's business was finally revealed to the Papal authorities by a customer; however she was so popular that the locals protected her from apprehension. She escaped to a church, where she was granted sanctuary. When a rapid rumour, claiming that she had poisoned the water, tore through Rome, the police forced their way into the church and dragged Tofana in for questioning.

=== Death ===

Under torture, she confessed to killing 600 men with her poisons in Rome alone between 1633 and 1651, but this cannot be confirmed owing to the torture and the widespread distribution of the poison. She was ultimately executed in Rome (in the [[Campo de' Fiori]]), together with her daughter (Girolama Spera, known as &quot;Astrologa della Lungara&quot;) and three helpers, in July 1659. After her death, her body was thrown over the wall of the church that had provided her with sanctuary. Some of the users and purveyors were also arrested and executed, while other accomplices were [[Immurement|bricked into]] the dungeons of the Palazzo Pucci.

There are incorrect references to her purported execution in Naples in 1719.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dash&quot;&gt;Mike Dash, &quot;Aqua Tofana: Slow-Poisoning and Husband-Killing in 17th Century Italy.&quot; [https://mikedashhistory.com/2012/02/16/the-mysterious-mr-zedzed-the-wickedest-man-in-the-world// A Blast From the Past, 6 April 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The legend that [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] might have been poisoned using Aqua Tofana is completely unsubstantiated.

== La Spara ==

Tofana is in many sources confused with Hieronyma Spara, &quot;La Spara&quot;, a woman with a similar profession in Italy about the same time. Probably this is another name of the 'Astrologa della Lungara'.

'''Giulio Andreotti''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Military Order of Italy|OMI]] [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|SMOM]] [[Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George|OCSG]] [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|OESSH]]}} ({{IPA-it|ˈʤuːljo andreˈɔtti|lang}}; 14 January 1919 –  6 May 2013) was an Italian [[politician]] and [[wikt:statesman|statesman]] who served as the 41st [[Prime Minister of Italy]] and leader of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party; he is the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy by time in office|fifth longest-serving]] Prime Minister since the [[Italian Unification]]. Andreotti is widely considered the most powerful and prominent leader of the so-called [[History of the Italian Republic#The &quot;First Republic&quot; (1948–1992)|First Republic]].

Beginning as a protégé of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], Andreotti achieved cabinet rank at a young age and occupied all the major offices of state over the course of a forty-year political career, being seen as a reassuring figure by the civil service, business community, and Vatican. In foreign policy, he guided Italy's [[European Union]] integration, and established closer relations with the Arab world. Admirers of Andreotti saw him as having mediated political and social contradictions, enabling the transformation of a substantially rural country into the fifth-biggest economy in the world. Critics said he had done nothing against a system of patronage that had led to pervasive corruption.

At the height of his prestige as a statesman, Andreotti was subjected to damaging criminal prosecutions. Charged with colluding with [[Cosa Nostra]], courts found he had broken the links by the 1980s, and ruled the case out of time. The most sensational allegation came from prosecutors in [[Perugia]], who charged him with ordering the murder of a journalist. He was found guilty at a trial, which led to complaints that the justice system had &quot;gone mad&quot;. Definitively acquitted by the supreme court, Andreotti remarked, &quot;Apart from the [[Punic Wars]], for which I was too young, I have been blamed for everything that's happened in Italy.&quot;

Andreotti served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|41st]] [[Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1972 to 1973, from 1976 to 1979 and from 1989 to 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/leg/17/BGT/Schede_v3/Attsen/00000074.htm|title=Giulio ANDREOTTI (XVII Legislatura), Dati anagrafici e incarichi|publisher=[[Senate of the Republic (Italy)]]|language=Italian|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] (1954 and 1978), [[Italian Minister of Defence|Defence Minister]] (1959–66 and 1974) and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister]] (1983–89) and was a [[Senator for life]] from 1991 until his death in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sen&quot;/&gt; He was also a journalist and author. Andreotti was sometimes called ''Divo Giulio'' (from Latin ''Divus Iulius'', &quot;Divine Julius&quot;, an [[epithet]] of [[Julius Caesar]] after his posthumous deification). During the 16th term of the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] in 2008–13, he opted to join the parliamentary group [[Union of the Centre (2008)|UDC – independence]].

==Background and attributes==
Giulio Andreotti, the youngest of three children, was born on 14 January 1919 in [[Rome]]. His father was a primary school teacher from [[Segni]], a small town in [[Lazio]], who died when Giulio was two; after a few years his sister Elena also died. Andreotti attended the [[Liceo Torquato Tasso]] in Rome and graduated in Law at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], with the vote of 110/110.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.degasperi.net/scheda_fonti.php?id_obj=2890&amp;obj_type=f12&amp;parent_cat=&lt;/ref&gt;

He showed some ferocity as a youth, once stubbing out a lit [[candle|taper]] in the eye of another [[altar boy]] who was ridiculing him. His mother was described as not very affectionate, and an aunt is said to have advised him to remember that few things in life are important, and never to over-dramatise difficulties. As an adult he was described as having a somewhat unusual demeanor for an Italian politician, being mild-mannered and unassuming. Andreotti did not use his influence to advance his children to prominence, despite being widely considered the most powerful person in the country for decades. &quot;See all, tolerate much, and correct one thing at a time,&quot;  was a quote that emphasised what has been called his 'art of the possible' view of politics. 

Andreotti was known for his discretion and retentive memory, and also a sense of humour, often placing things in perspective with a sardonic quip.&lt;ref name=Sen/&gt;&lt;ref name=jessup&gt;{{cite book| last=Jessup| first=John E.| title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945–1996| year=1998| publisher=Greenwood Press| location=Westport, CT| page=25| url=http://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict}} {{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/20/giulio-andreotti| title=John Hooper talks to the former Italian PM Giulio Andreotti about his links to the mafia| author=John Hooper| work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dk98&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Political Biography| year=1998| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=14| url=http://www.questia.com/read/34683400/a-dictionary-of-political-biography| author=Dennis Kavanagh| accessdate=31 August 2013| chapter=Andreotti, Giulio}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/giulio-andreotti-politician-who-dominated-the-italian-scene-for-more-than-half-century-8605139.html| title=Giulio Andreotti: Politician who dominated the Italian scene for more than half century| work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andreotti's personal support within the Christian Democrats was limited, but he had the ability to see where the mutual advantage for apparently conflicting interests lay, and put himself at the centre of events as mediator.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIULIO ANDREOTTI, 1919–2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/popular-pm-faced-trial-with-dignity-20130507-2j5l5.html| title=Giulio Andreotti| work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Andreotti did not shine at his school and started work in a tax office while studying law at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]].&lt;ref name=dk98/&gt; In this period he became a member of the [[Italian Catholic Federation of University Students]] (FUCI), the only non-[[fascist]] youth organization which was allowed by the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]]. Its members included many of the future leaders of the Italian [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]. 

In 1938 while researching the papal navy in the Vatican library, he met [[Alcide De Gasperi]], who had been given sanctuary by the Pope. De Gasperi asked Andreotti if he had nothing better to do with his time, inspiring him to become politically active. Speaking of De Gasperi, Andreotti said, &quot;He taught us to search for compromise, to mediate.&quot;&lt;ref name=ind240995&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14008143 All the prime minister's men], by [[Alexander Stille]], ''The Independent'', 24 September 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jessup/&gt;

In July 1939, while [[Aldo Moro]] was president of FUCI,&lt;ref&gt;Tiziano Torresi,'' L'altra giovinezza. Gli universitari cattolici dal 1935 al 1940'', Cittadella editrice, 2010, with a preface by Andreotti himself. {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andreotti became director of its magazine ''Azione Fucina''. In 1942, when Moro was enrolled in the Italian Army, Andreotti succeeded him as president of FUCI, a position he held until 1944. During his early years Andreotti suffered violent [[migraine]]s that forced him to sporadically make use of psychoactive drugs and [[opiate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggero Orfei,&quot;Andreotti&quot;, Feltrinelli, 1975. {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], Andreotti wrote for the ''Rivista del Lavoro'', a fascist propaganda publication, but was also a member of the then-clandestine newspaper ''Il Popolo''. In 1944 he became a member of the National Council of the Christian Democracy Party, and after the end of the conflict he became responsible for the youth organization of the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIULIO ANDREOTTI, 1919–2013&quot;/&gt;

===Chamber of Deputies and government===
In 1946, Andreotti was elected to the [[Assemblea Costituente|Constituent Assembly]], the provisional parliament which had the task of writing the new Italian constitution. His election was supported by [[Alcide De Gasperi]], founder of the modern DC, whose assistant Andreotti became. In 1948, he was elected to the newly formed [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] to represent the constituency of Rome-[[Latina, Lazio|Latina]]-[[Viterbo]]-[[Frosinone]], which remained his stronghold until the 1990s.

Andreotti began his government career in 1947, when he became [[Secretary of the Council of Ministers of Italy|Secretary of the Council of Ministers]] in the cabinet of his patron De Gasperi, who reputedly said Andreotti was 'so capable in everything that he could become capable of anything.' Andreotti had wider ranging responsibilities than many full ministers, which caused some envy.

===Influence on culture ===
As the state undersecretary in charge of entertainment in 1949, Andreotti established import limits and screen quotas, and provided loans to Italian production firms. The measures were aimed at preventing American productions from dominating the market against [[Neorealist film]]s, a genre which exhibitors complained lacked stars and was held in low esteem by the public. As he phrased it, there were to be 'Less rags, more legs'. Raunchy comedies and historical dramas with voluptuous toga-clad actresses became the staple of the Italian film industry. To ensure that state funds were not used to prop up commercially unsustainable films, the screenplays were vetted, thereby creating a form of preproduction [[censorship]]. It was intended that Italian studios use part of their profits for high-quality films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/06/giulio-andreotti-prime-minister| title=Giulio Andreotti obituary| author=Donald Sassoon| work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Umberto D.]]'', which depicted the lonely life of a retired man, could only strike government officials as a dangerous throwback, due to the opening scene featuring police breaking up a demonstration of old pensioners and the ending scene featuring Umberto's aborted suicide attempt. In a public letter to De Sica, Andreotti castigated him for his &quot;wretched service to his fatherland.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David; Thompson, Kristin. 2010. ''Film History: An Introduction.'' 3rd ed. NY: McGraw Hill. p #333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
In 1952, ahead of local elections in the municipality of Rome, Andreotti gave proof of his diplomatic skills and gained credibility. In fact Andreotti persuaded De Gasperi not to establish a political alliance with the neo-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]], to prevent a Communist victory. 

As Undersecretary, Andreotti contributed to the re-formation of the [[Italian Olympic Committee]], which had been disbanded after the fall of the Fascist regime.

[[File:Giulio Andreotti anni 60.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Andreotti during the [[1960s]]]]
In 1954, Andreotti became [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] in the first government of [[Amintore Fanfani]]. From July 1956 to July 1958 he was appointed Finance Minister in the cabinets of [[Antonio Segni]] and [[Adone Zoli]]. In the same period, Andreotti started to form a ''corrente'' (unofficial political association, or a faction) within the Christian Democracy, which was then the largest party in Italy. His ''corrente'' was supported by the Roman Catholic right wing. It started its activity with a press campaign accusing [[Piero Piccioni]], son of the deputy national secretary of the DC, [[Attilio Piccioni]], of the murder of fashion model [[Wilma Montesi]] at [[Torvaianica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/luglio/02/Caso_Montesi_talpa_Fanfani_co_9_090702056.shtml| title=Caso Montesi, la talpa di Fanfani| last=Messina| first=Dino| date=2 July 2009| work=Corriere della Sera| accessdate=17 October 2010| language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat of De Gasperi's old followers in the DC National Council, Andreotti helped another newly formed ''corrente'', the ''Dorotei'', to oust Amintore Fanfani, who was the leader of the left-wing of the party, as Prime Minister of Italy and National Secretary of the DC.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Proietti, &quot;Morto Franco Evangelisti il camerlengo di Andreotti&quot;, ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', 12 November 1993, p. 15. {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November 1958 Andreotti, then Minister of Treasury, was appointed president of the organizing committee of the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] to be held in Rome. 

In the early [[1960s]] Andreotti was [[Italian Minister of Defence|Minister of Defence]], and was widely considered the ''de facto'' leader of the right-wing Christian Democratic opposition to [[Aldo Moro]]'s strategy. In this period the revelation that dossiers on virtually every public figure in the country had been compiled by the secret service resulted in the [[SIFAR]] affair. Andreotti ordered the destruction of the dossiers; but before the destruction Andreotti provided the documents to [[Licio Gelli]], the [[Worshipful Master|Venerable Master]] of the clandestine lodge [[Propaganda Due]] (P2).&lt;ref&gt;SENATO DELLA REPUBBLICA-CAMERA DEI DEPUTATI, XII LEGISLATURA, Doc. XXXIV, n. 1, RELAZIONE DEL COMITATO PARLAMENTARE PER I SERVIZI DI INFORMAZIONE E SICUREZZA E PER IL SEGRETO DI STATO, § 4.2: &quot;Appare credibile quanto affermato a suo tempo dall'ingegnere Francesco Siniscalchi e dai dottori Ermenegildo Benedetti e Giovanni Bricchi circa una possibile donazione di fascicoli che l'ex capo del SIFAR Giovanni Allavena avrebbe effettuato a Gelli al momento di aderire alla loggia P2 nel 1967. Negli anni successivi, inoltre, l'adesione alla loggia di pressoché tutti i principali dirigenti del SID rende più che plausibile un travaso informativo da questi ultimi a Gelli&quot;. {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Andreotti was also involved in the [[Piano Solo]] scandal, an envisaged plot for an Italian coup in 1964 requested by then-President of the Italian Republic [[Antonio Segni]]. It was prepared by the commander of the Carabinieri, Giovanni de Lorenzo, in the beginning of 1964 in close collaboration with the Italian secret service (SIFAR), CIA secret warfare expert [[Vernon Walters]], [[William King Harvey|William Harvey]], then-chief of the CIA station in Rome, and Renzo Rocca, director of the [[Gladio]] units within the military secret service SID.

In 1968, Andreotti was appointed speaker of the parliamentary group of the Christian Democracy, a position he held until 1972.

==First term as Prime Minister==
In 1972, Andreotti's first term as Prime Minister began a period when he was often seen as the ''[[éminence grise]]'' of governments even when not actually premier. He remained in office in two consecutive centre-right cabinets in 1972 and in 1973.

===Social policies===
Andeotti's approach owed little to a belief that market mechanisms could be left to work without interference. He used [[price controls]] on essential food stuffs and various social reforms to reach an understanding with organised labour. A law of 11 August 1972 extended health insurance to citizens over the age of 65 in receipt of a social pension. A law of 30 June 1973 extended cost of living indexation to the social pension. 

A devout Catholic, Andreotti was on close terms with six successive pontiffs. He gave the [[Holy See|Vatican]] unsolicited advice on occasion, and was often heeded. He updated the relationship of Roman Catholicism to the Italian state in an accord he presented to parliament. It put the country on a more secular basis: abolishing Roman Catholicism as the state religion, making religious instruction in public schools optional, and having the Church accept Italy's [[divorce]] law, in 1971. Andreotti opposed legal divorce and [[abortion]], but despite his party opposition, wasn't able to avoid the legalization of abortion in May 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giulio Andreotti OBIT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2013/05/06/news/giulio_andreotti_dead_the_main_character_of_60_years_of_italian_history_dies-58173783/| title=Ex-Italian PM Giulio Andreotti dies.

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Nixon Andreotti 1973.jpg|thumb|Andreotti with [[Richard Nixon]], 1973]]

In 1972 he paid an official visit to the [[Soviet Union]], which was the first one by an Italian prime minister in more than a decade. 

During his premiership, Italy opened and developed diplomatic and economic relationships with Arab countries of the [[Mediterranean Basin]], and supported business and trade between Italy and the Soviet Union.

==Second term as Prime Minister==
In 1976, the [[Italian Socialist Party]] left the centre-left government of [[Aldo Moro]]. The ensuing elections saw the growth of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), and the DC kept only a minimal advantage as the relative majority party in Italy, which was then suffering from an economic crisis and from [[terrorism]]. After the success of his party, PCI secretary [[Enrico Berlinguer]] approached DC's left-leaning leaders, Moro and Fanfani, with a proposal to bring forward the so-called &quot;[[Historic Compromise]]&quot;, a political pact proposed by Moro which would see a government coalition between DC and PCI for the first time. Andreotti, known as an anti-communist, was called in to lead the first experiment in that direction: his new cabinet, formed in July 1976, included only members of his own Christian Democrat party but had the indirect support of the communists.  

===Legislative action===
On 28 January 1977 the [[Italian Parliament|Parliament]] approved the Land Use Law, which introduced severe constraints on construction, such as new criteria for land expropriations and new planning procedures. On 27 July 1978, the Fair Rent Law completed state control of rents with general rules for rent levels and terms of leases. A law of 16 February 1977 introduced ad hoc upgrading of cash benefits for the agricultural sector. In November 1977, pension linkage to the industrial wage was extended to all other pension schemes not administered by INPS. A law of 16 February 1977 extended family allowances to agricultural part-time workers. A law of 5 August 1978 introduced a ten-year housing plan, with the state making funds available to regions for public housing and subsidies for private housing.&lt;ref&gt;Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II Volume 4, ed. Peter Flora&lt;/ref&gt; As premier, Andeotti's urging of fellow leaders in the [[European Community]] was influential in the creation of an EU Regional Development Fund, which the south of Italy was to greatly benefit from.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giulio Andreotti OBIT&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/10039937/Giulio-Andreotti.html| title=Giulio Andreotti| date=6 May 2013| work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Andreotti dealt with an economic crisis by criticising the luxury lifestyle of many Italians and pushing through tough [[austerity]] measures. This cabinet fell in January 1978. In March, the crisis was overcome by the intervention of Moro, who proposed a new cabinet, again formed only by DC politicians, but this time with positive confidence votes from the other parties, including the PCI. This cabinet was also chaired by Andreotti, and was formed on 16 March 1978.

===Kidnapping of Aldo Moro===
{{main|Kidnapping of Aldo Moro}}
[[File:Moro Andreotti.jpg|thumb|right|Giulio Andreotti with [[Aldo Moro]]]]
On the morning of 16 March 1978, the day on which the new Andreotti cabinet was supposed to have undergone a [[confidence and supply|confidence]] vote in the [[Italian Parliament]], the car of Aldo Moro, then-president of the Christian Democracy, was assaulted by a group of [[Red Brigades]] (Italian: ''Brigate Rosse'', or BR) terrorists in Via Fani in Rome. Firing automatic weapons, the terrorists killed Moro's bodyguards (two [[Carabinieri]] in Moro's car and three [[law enforcement in Italy|policemen]] in the following car) and kidnapped him.

During the kidnapping of Moro, Andreotti refused any negotiation with the terrorists. Moro, during his imprisonment, wrote a statement expressing very harsh judgements against Andreotti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.valeriolucarelli.it/MemorialeMoro.pdf| title=Il Memoriale di Aldo Moro| last=Moro| first=Aldo| year=1978| accessdate=17 October 2010| language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 9 May 1978 Moro's body was found in the [[trunk (car)|trunk]] of a [[Renault 4]] in Via Caetani after 55 days of imprisonment, during which Moro was submitted to a political trial by the so-called &quot;people's court&quot; set up by the Brigate Rosse and the Italian government was asked for an exchange of prisoners.

After his death, Andreotti continued as Prime Minister of the &quot;National Solidarity&quot; government with the support of the PCI. Laws approved during his tenure included the reform of the Italian National Health Service. However, when the PCI asked to participate more directly in the government, Andreotti refused, and the government was dissolved in June 1979. Due also to conflict with [[Bettino Craxi]], secretary of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), the other main party in Italy at the time, Andreotti did not hold any further government position until 1983.

==Foreign Affairs Minister==
In 1983, Andreotti became [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the first Cabinet of Bettino Craxi, despite the long-lasting personal antagonism between the two men which had occurred earlier on; Craxi was the first Socialist to become Prime Minister of Italy since [[Italian unification|Unification]]. 

===Sigonella Crisis===
{{main|Achille Lauro hijacking}}
[[File:Giulio Andreotti e Bettino Craxi.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Andreotti with the Socialist leader and Prime Minister [[Bettino Craxi]]]]
On October 7, 1985, four men representing the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] (PLF) [[Piracy|hijacked]] the Italian [[MS Achille Lauro|MS ''Achille Lauro'']] liner off the coast of [[Egypt]], as she was sailing from [[Alexandria]] to [[Ashdod]], Israel. The hijacking was organized by [[Muhammad Zaidan]], leader of the PLF. One 69-year-old Jewish American man in a wheelchair, [[Leon Klinghoffer]], was murdered by the hijackers and thrown overboard.

The Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers was intercepted by [[F-14 Tomcat]]s from the [[VF-74]] &quot;BeDevilers&quot; and the [[VF-103]] &quot;Sluggers&quot; of [[Carrier Air Wing 17]], based on the aircraft carrier [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS ''Saratoga'']],&lt;ref name=&quot;F14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topedge.com/panels/aircraft/sites/mats/combat.htm#achille |title=The 1985 Achille Lauro affair |publisher=F-14 Tomcat in Combat |accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and directed to land at [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] (a [[NATO]] air base in [[Sicily]]) under the orders of U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]]; there, the hijackers were arrested by the Italian [[Carabinieri]]&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, Philip B.

[[Italian Air Force]] personnel and Carabinieri lined up facing the [[United States Navy SEALs]] which had arrived with two [[C-141]]s. Other Carabinieri were sent from [[Catania]] to reinforce the Italians. The US eventually allowed the hijackers to be taken into Italian custody, after receiving assurances that the hijackers would be tried for murder.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, William P.; Brown, James (2004).

===Policies===
[[File:Berlusconi Andreotti 1984.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Giulio Andreotti with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] in 1984]]
As Minister Andreotti encouraged diplomacy between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and improving Italian links with Arab countries. In this respect he followed a line similar to that of Craxi, with whom he had an otherwise troubled political relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Andreotti| first= Giulio| title=Foreign policy in the Italian democracy| journal= Political Science Quarterly| volume=109| issue= Special Issue 1994| page=529| doi=10.2307/2152618}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 14 April 1986, Andreotti revealed to Libyan Foreign Minister [[Abdel Rahman Shalgham]] that the [[Operation El Dorado Canyon|United States would bomb Libya]] the next day in retaliation for the [[1986 West Berlin discotheque bombing|Berlin disco terrorist attack]] which had been linked to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uslatest/story/0,,-7962518,00.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321100633/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-7962518,00.html |date=21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the warning from Italy&amp;nbsp;– a supposed ally of the US&amp;nbsp;– Libya was better prepared for the bombing. Nevertheless, on the following day Libya fired two [[Scud]]s at the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]] in retaliation. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As Craxi's relationship with the then-National Secretary of the DC, [[Ciriaco De Mita]], was even worse, Andreotti was instrumental in the creation of the so-called &quot;CAF triangle&quot; (from the initials of the surnames of Craxi, Andreotti and another DC leader, [[Arnaldo Forlani]]) opposing De Mita's power. 

After Craxi's resignation in 1987, Andreotti remained Minister of Foreign Affairs also in the governments of [[Amintore Fanfani|Fanfani]] and De Mita. In 1989, when De Mita's government fell, Andreotti was appointed as new Prime Minister

==Last term as Prime Minister==
[[File:Giulio Andreotti, ca 1987.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Portrait of Andreotti in the late [[1980s]]]]
On 22 July 1989, Andreotti was sworn in for the third time as Prime Minister. His government was characterized by a turbulent course: Andreotti decided to stay at the head of government, despite the abandonment of many [[social democracy|social democratic]] ministers, after the approval of the norm on TV spots (favorable to private TV channels of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]). This choice did not prevent the resurgence of old suspicions and resentments with Craxi. 

In 1990 the [[Operation Gladio]] scandal broke out; Gladio was the codename for a clandestine [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) &quot;stay-behind&quot; operation in Italy during the [[Cold War]]. Its purpose was to prepare for, and implement, armed resistance in the event of a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion and conquest. Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO [[stay-behind]] organizations, &quot;Operation Gladio&quot; is used as an informal name for all of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haberman Times 1990&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Haberman | first=Clyde | last2=Times | first2=Special to The New York | title=EVOLUTION IN EUROPE; Italy Discloses Its Web Of Cold War Guerrillas | website=The New York Times | date=Nov 16, 1990  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/16/world/evolution-in-europe-italy-discloses-its-web-of-cold-war-guerrillas.html | accessdate=Feb 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his premiership Andreotti clashed many times with President of the Republic [[Francesco Cossiga]].

===European Union negotiations===
In 1990 Andreotti was involved in getting all parties to agree to a binding timetable for the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. The deep [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] favoured by Italy was opposed by Britain's [[Margaret Thatcher]], who wanted a system of competition between currencies. Germany had doubts about committing to the project without requiring economic reforms from Italy, which was seen as having various imbalances. As President of the European Council, Andreotti co-opted Germany by making admittance to the single market automatic once the criteria had been met, and committing to a rigorous overhaul of Italian public finances. Critics later questioned Andreotti's understanding of the obligation, or whether he had ever intended to fulfill it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ca48d566-a43d-11e1-84b1-00144feabdc0.html| title=Giulio Andreotti, Italian statesman| work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Ferrera, Elisabetta Gualmini, &quot;Rescued by Europe?: Social and Labour Market Reforms in Italy&quot;, p. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation and decline===
In 1992, at the end of the legislature, Andreotti resigned from premiership; he was the last Christian Democratic Prime Minister of Italy. The previous year, Cossiga had appointed him [[Senator for Life]]. Andreotti was one of the most likely candidates to succeed Cossiga as President of the Republic in the [[Italian presidential election, 1992|1992 election]]. 

Andreotti and the members of his ''corrente'' had adopted a strategy of launching his candidature only after effectively quenching all the others. The strategy was thwarted by allegations against him; moreover, the election was influenced by the murder of the [[anti-mafia]] magistrate [[Giovanni Falcone]] in [[Palermo]].

==Later political life==
===Tangentopoli===
{{main|Mani Pulite}}
In 1992 an investigation was started in [[Milan]], dubbed ''[[Mani pulite]]''. It uncovered endemic corruption practices at the highest levels, causing many spectacular (and sometimes controversial) arrests and resignations. After the dismaying result in the [[Italian general election, 1992|1992 general election]] (29.7%) and two years of mounting scandals (which included several Mafia investigations which notably touched Andreotti), the Christian Democracy was disbanded in 1994. In the 1990s most of the politicians prosecuted during those investigations were acquitted, sometimes however on the basis of legal formalities or on the basis of [[statute of limitations|statutory time limit]] rules.

===After the Christian Democracy===
The Christian Democracy suffered heavy defeats in the provincial and municipal elections, and polling suggested heavy losses in [[Italian general election, 1994|the election due in the spring of 1994]]. In hopes of changing the party's image, the DC's last secretary, [[Mino Martinazzoli]], decided to change the name of the party to the [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]]. [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]], representing the centre-right faction of the party (previously led by Forlani), decided to launch a new party called [[Christian Democratic Centre]] and to form an alliance with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s new party, [[Forza Italia]]. The left wing faction either joined the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] or stayed within the new Italian People's Party, while some right-wingers others joined [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].  

[[File:Giulio Andreotti-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Andreotti in the late 2000s]]
Andreotti joined the Italian People's Party of Mino Martinazzoli. In 2001 after the creation of [[The Daisy]], a centre-left alliance of parties, Andreotti abandoned the People's Party and joined the [[European Democracy]], a minor [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CottaVerzichelli2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author1=Maurizio Cotta| author2=Luca Verzichelli| title=Political Institutions of Italy| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-FAZHBDqggC&amp;pg=PA38| accessdate=24 August 2012| year=2007| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-928470-2|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; political party in Italy, led by Sergio D'Antoni, former leader of the [[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions]]. Andreotti became immediately a prominent member of the party and was widely considered as the ''de facto'' leader of the movement.

In the [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 general election]] the party scored 2.3% on a stand-alone list, winning only two seats in the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellucci2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author=Paolo Bellucci| title=The Return of Berlusconi| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eQlN4Fop5QC&amp;pg=PA296|year=2002| publisher=Berghahn Books| isbn=978-1-57181-611-5| page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2002 it was merged with the [[Christian Democratic Centre]] and the [[United Christian Democrats]] to form the [[Union of the Centre (2002)|Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GilbertNilsson2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author1=Mark F.

In 2006, Andreotti stood for the Presidency of the Italian Senate, obtaining 156 votes against the 165 of [[Franco Marini]], former Labour Minister in the last Andreotti Cabinet. On 21 January 2008 he abstained from a vote in the Senate concerning Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]]'s report on foreign politics. Together with the abstentions of another life senator, [[Sergio Pininfarina]], and of two communist senators, this caused the government to lose the vote. Consequently, Prime Minister [[Romano Prodi]] resigned. On previous occasions, Andreotti had always supported Prodi's government with his vote.

In 2008 Giulio Andreotti joined the [[Union of the Centre (2002)|Union of the Centre]] of Pier Ferdinando Casini.

==Controversies==
===Trial for Mafia association===
[[File:Salvo Lima.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Salvatore Lima]]]]
Andreotti came under suspicion because his relatively small faction within the Christian Democrats included Sicilian [[Salvatore Lima]]. In Sicily, Lima cooperated with a [[Palermo]]-based Mafia, which operated below the surface of public life by using control of large numbers of votes to enable mutually beneficial relationships with local politicians. Andreotti said, &quot;But Lima never spoke to me about these things.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Follain, J., Vendetta, 2012&quot;&gt;Follain, J., Vendetta, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s the old low-profile Mafia was overthrown by the [[Corleonesi]], an extremely violent faction led by fugitive [[Salvatore Riina]].&lt;ref name=st384&gt;Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas old Mafia bosses had been cautious about violence, Riina's targeting of anti-mafia officials proved ever more counter-productive. The 1982 murders of parliamentarian [[Pio La Torre]] and Carabinieri general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] led to the [[Maxi Trial]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside The Mafia&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.1channel.ch/watch-757991-National-Geographic-Inside-The-Mafia| title=PrimeWire - 1Channel - LetMeWatchThis - Watch Movies Online Free - Just Added| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors, who could not be disciplined or removed except by their own self-government board, the CSM, were given increased powers.&lt;ref name=Mirabella&gt;Mirabella, Julia Grace, &quot;Scales of Justice: Assessing Italian Criminal Procedure Through the Amanda Knox Trial (January 5, 2012)&quot;. ''Boston University International Law Journal'', Vol. 30, No. 1, 2012. footnote 151&lt;/ref&gt; After the January 1992 upholding of the Maxi Trial verdicts as definitive convictions by the supreme court, Riina embarked on a renewed campaign which claimed the lives of the prosecuting magistrates, [[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]], and their police guards. As Riina intended, the assassination of Falcone discredited Andreotti and prevented him becoming the president of Italy. It also led to prosecutors being seen as epitomising civic virtue.&lt;ref&gt;John Follain, ''Vendetta: The Mafia, Judge Falcone, and the Hunt for Justice'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1993 Riina was arrested in Palermo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Follain, J., Vendetta, 2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D8153AF935A25752C0A965958260&amp;scp=11&amp;sq=riina&amp;st=nyt| title=Italy Arrests Sicilian Mafia's Top Leader| date=16 January 1993| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of Riina's capture there were further Mafia bomb outrages that included terror attacks on art galleries and churches, which left ten members of the public dead, and led to weakening of rules on the evidence which prosecutors could use to bring charges.&lt;ref name=Mirabella/&gt;

In 1993 Andreotti stood trial in Palermo, charged with membership in a Mafia association. Prosecutors said in return for electoral support of Lima and assassination of Andreotti's enemies, he had agreed to protect the Mafia, which had expected him to fix the Maxi Trial. The defence said Andreotti had been a long-time politician of national stature, never beholden to Lima; and that far from providing protection, Andreotti had passed many tough anti-mafia laws when in government during the 80's.&lt;ref&gt;''Italian Politics: The Faltering Transition'', ed. Mark Gilbert, Gianfranco Pasquino, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andreotti's lawyers, the prosecution case was based on conjecture and inference, without any concrete proof of direct involvement by Andreotti. The defence also contended the prosecution relied on the word of mafia turncoats whose evidence had been contradictory. One such informer testified that Riina and Andreotti had met and exchanged a &quot;kiss of honour&quot;.&lt;ref name=stille392&gt;Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt220594&gt;{{cite web| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E4D61038F931A15756C0A962958260| title=Italy Inquiry Asks Andreotti's Trial on Mafia Ties| date=22 May 1994| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt210493&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D7163DF932A15757C0A965958260| title=Andreotti and Mafia -  A Kiss Related - NYTimes.com| date=21 April 1993| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged that the informer had received a US$300,000 'bonus' and committed a number of murders while in the witness protection programme.&lt;ref name=stille392&gt;Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt210493&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=andreotti&gt;http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/wordtheque/it/AAAALF.TXT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.almanaccodeimisteri.info/mafiaaprile2002.htm| title=almanaccodeimisteri.info| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andreotti dismissed the allegation against him as &quot;lies and slander […] the kiss of Riina, mafia summits […] scenes out of a comic horror film.&quot;  
&lt;ref name=stille392/&gt;

====Andreotti's absolution====
Andreotti was completely acquitted at first instance, again on appeal to the Court of Appeals, and finally on appeal to the Court of Cassation in 2004. None of the accusations held up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giulio Andreotti OBIT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2004/j/sezioni/cronaca/andreotti/andreotti/andreotti.html Andreotti assolto, il caso è chiuso: non frequentava i mafiosi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court didn't confirm that Andreotti had colluded with Cosa Nostra till the spring of 1980. The sentence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore the appealed sentence [...] has recognized the participation in the associative crime not in the reductive terms of mere availability, but in the widest and juridically significant ones of a concrete collaboration», that quotes the opinion of the Court of Appeal, is immediately followed by another sentence of the Court of Cassation: «The reconstruction of single episodes and the evaluation of their consequences was made in accordance with comments and interpretations that can also be not shared and against which other ones can be relied on.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
According to this opinion, the Court of Cassation definitely absolved Giulio Andreotti of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiachiamaitalia.it/articoli/detalles/14963/Andreotti+era+innocente%3A+quando+le+sentenza+di+assoluzione+non+valgono+%96+di+Andrea+Di+Bella.html La Cassazione: Andreotti era innocente]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leggioggi.it&quot;&gt;[http://www.leggioggi.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Sentenza-Cassazione-Andreotti-2004-1.pdf Suprema Corte di Cassazione, Sezione Seconda Penale, sentenza n.49691/2004 (Presidente: G.M. Cosentino; Relatore: M. Massera) Depositata in Cancelleria il 28 dicembre 2004. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Court of Cassation ruled that Andreotti had slandered a judge who had given testimony, by saying the self-governing body of prosecutors and judges should remove him from his position. Andreotti had said that leaving the man as a judge was &quot;like leaving a lighted fuse in the hand of a child.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/english/andreotti-convicted-of-slandering-judge-no332432/| title=La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno.it| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial for murder===
{{main|Carmine Pecorelli#Death}}
[[File:Pecorellimurder.jpg|thumbnail|right|220px|[[Carmine Pecorelli]]'s dead body in his [[Citroën CX]], in 1979]]

Contemporaneously with his trial for Mafia association, Andreotti was tried in [[Perugia]] with Sicilian Mafia boss [[Gaetano Badalamenti]], [[Massimo Carminati]], and others on charges of complicity in the murder of journalist [[Mino Pecorelli]].&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/the-andreotti-affair-supergrasses-target-andreotti-1455507.html| title=The Andreotti Affair: Supergrasses target Andreotti| work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was circumstantial and based on the word of Mafia turncoat [[Tommaso Buscetta]], who had not originally mentioned the allegation about Andreotti when interviewed by [[Giovanni Falcone]] and had recanted it by the time of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/12/world/andreotti-is-back-in-court-this-time-on-murder-charge.html| title=Andreotti Is Back in Court, This Time on Murder Charge| date=12 April 1996| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/all-the-prime-ministers-men-1602608.html| title=All the Prime Minister's Men| work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mino Pecorelli was killed in Rome's Prati district with four gunshots, on March 20, 1979. The bullets used to kill him were ''Gevelot'' brand, a peculiarly rare type of bullets not easily found on gun markets, legal and clandestine alike. The same kind of bullets were later found in the ''[[Banda della Magliana]]'' 's weapon stock, concealed in the Health Ministry's basement. Investigations targeted [[Massimo Carminati]], member of the far-right organization ''[[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]]'' (NAR) and of the ''Banda della Magliana'', the head of Propaganda Due, [[Licio Gelli]], Antonio Viezzer, Cristiano Fioravanti and [[Valerio Fioravanti]].

On April 6, 1993, Mafia [[pentito|turncoat]] Tommaso Buscetta told Palermo prosecutors that he had learnt from his boss [[Gaetano Badalamenti]] that Pecorelli's murder had been carried out in the interest of Andreotti. The Salvo cousins, two powerful Sicilian politicians with deep ties to local Mafia families, were also involved in the murder. Buscetta testified that Gaetano Badalamenti told him that the murder had been commissioned by the Salvo cousins as a favor to Andreotti. Andreotti allegedly was afraid that Pecorelli was about to publish information that could have destroyed his political career. Among the information was the complete memorial of [[Aldo Moro]], which would be published only in 1990 and which Pecorelli had shown to general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/aprile/15/intreccio_Pecorelli_Moro_gia_anno_co_0_930415968.shtml| title=Intreccio Pecorelli-Moro: già da un anno s'indaga| last=Maria Antonietta|first=Calabrò| publisher=Corriere della Sera| language=Italian| accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalla Chiesa was also assassinated by Mafia in September 1982.

Andreotti was acquitted along with his co-defendants in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/25/world/ex-premier-andreotti-acquitted-of-mafia-murder-conspiracy.html| title=Ex-Premier Andreotti Acquitted of Mafia Murder Conspiracy| date=25 September 1999| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local prosecutors successfully appealed the acquittal and there was a retrial, which in 2002 convicted Andreotti and sentenced him to 24 years imprisonment. Italians of all political allegiances denounced the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/31/world/court-clears-andreotti-of-murder-charge.html| title=Court Clears Andreotti of Murder Charge| date=31 October 2003| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/19/world/andreotti-s-sentence-draws-protests-about-justice-gone-mad.html?ref=giulioandreotti| title=Andreotti's Sentence Draws Protests About 'Justice Gone Mad'| date=19 November 2002| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many failed to understand how the court could convict Andreotti of orchestrating the killing, yet acquit his co-accused, who supposedly had carried out his orders by setting up and committing the murder.&lt;ref&gt;The Age Au, Andreotti fights back on Mafia allegations, November 30, 2002, By Philip Willan&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian supreme court definitively acquitted Andreotti of the murder in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giulio Andreotti OBIT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/10039937/Giulio-Andreotti.html |title=Giulio Andreotti |newspaper=Telegraph |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Andreotti said the opinion of others was of little consequence to him, and &quot;In any case, a few years from now, no one will remember me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com&quot;/&gt; He died in [[Rome]] on 6 May 2013 after suffering from respiratory problems, at 94 years.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22426199 | title = Giulio Andreotti: Ex-Italian prime minister dies| work=BBC News| accessdate= 6 May 2013| date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC described him as &quot;one of the most prominent political figures of post-war Italy&quot;.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted he had &quot;a résumé of signal accomplishments and checkered failings that reads like a history of the republic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/world/europe/giulio-andreotti-premier-of-italy-7-times-dies-at-94.html?_r=0| work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=6 May 2013| date=6 May 2013| first=John| last=Tagliabue| title=Giulio Andreotti, Premier of Italy 7 Times, Dies at 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mayor of Rome]], [[Gianni Alemanno]], announced the death, stating that Andreotti was &quot;the most representative politician&quot; Italy had known in its recent history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/06/giulio-andreotti-italian-pm-dies| work=[[The Guardian]]| accessdate=6 May 2013| date=6 May 2013| title=Giulio Andreotti, former Italian prime minister, dies aged 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspiracy theories===
Andreotti was accused of participation in a variety of plots. He was alleged to be the ''éminence grise'' behind the [[Propaganda Due]] Masonic Lodge, a secret association of corrupt politicians, civil servants, industrialists, military leaders, heads of the secret service, and prominent journalists conspiring to prevent the Italian Communist Party taking office. This theory posited control of elements ranging from the neo-fascist [[Valerio Fioravanti]] to Rome gangsters the [[Banda della Magliana]] and to [[Operation Gladio]], a clandestine NATO organisation that was intended to fight a Soviet conquest of Europe through an armed resistance movement. 

Andreotti was also accused of having a hand in the death of [[Aldo Moro]] and terrorist massacres in a [[strategy of tension]] aimed at precipitating a coup, as well as banking scandals and various high-profile assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;Gancer, D., ''Nato's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monzat89&gt;René Monzat, ''Enquêtes sur la droite extrême'', [[Le Monde]]-éditions, 1992, p.89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Puppetmasters: The Political Use of Terrorism in Italy'', p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/the-terror-trail-that-wont-grow-cold-dark-forces-bombed-bologna-station-in-1980-killing-85-at-a-retrial-tomorrow-the-victims-relatives-may-see-justice-done-1509705.html| title=The terror trail that won't grow cold: Dark forces bombed Bologna station in 1980, killing 85.

====Related perceptions of Andreotti====
[[File:Belzebu.jpg|thumb|180px|Cover of the Italian weekly [[Panorama (magazine)|''Panorama'']] featuring Andreotti]]
Fictional characters have been influenced by his image as a [[Machiavellian]]. A rejoinder that Andreotti made in reply to an inquiry if being in power was wearing him out—&quot;Power wears out those who don't have it&quot;—was put into the mouth of the character of a powerful Mafia-linked politician in the film ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bondanella, ''Hollywood Italians: Dagos, Palookas, Romeos, Wise Guys, and Sopranos'', p.269&lt;/ref&gt; He was nicknamed ''Belzebù'' ([[Beelzebub]]) or &quot;The Devil himself&quot; by [[Bettino Craxi]], a political opponent who later fled Italy while sought on corruption charges. Other disparaging nicknames included &quot;The Black Pope&quot; and &quot;The [[Hunchback]]&quot; (he had a malformed spine). Although relatively tall for an Italian of his generation, cartoonists sometimes portrayed Andreotti as a hunchback dwarf lurking in the background.&lt;ref name=tim290406&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article711140.ece| title=Login| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A joke about Andreotti (originally seen in a strip by Stefano Disegni and Massimo Caviglia) had him receiving a phone call from a fellow party member, who pleaded with him to attend judge [[Giovanni Falcone]]'s funeral. His friend supposedly begged, &quot;The State must give an answer to the Mafia, and you are one of the top authorities in it!&quot; To which a puzzled Andreotti asked, &quot;Which one do you mean?&quot; 

In 2008 Andreotti became the subject of [[Paolo Sorrentino]]'s acclaimed movie ''[[Il Divo (film)|Il Divo]]'', which portrayed him as a glib, unsympathetic figure, in whose orbit people tended to meet untimely and unnatural deaths. He reportedly lost his temper when he first saw the movie, but later joked, &quot;I'm happy for the producer. And I'd be even happier if I had a share of the takings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tim190309&gt;{{cite web| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5932272.ece| title=Login| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9053">{{Expand Italian|Giuseppe Bastianini|date=April 2013}}
'''Giuseppe Bastianini''' (8 March 1899 – 17 December 1961) was an [[Italy|Italian]] politician and diplomat. Initially associated with the hard-line elements of the [[fascism|fascist]] movements he later became a member of the dissident tendency.

==Early years==
Bastianini was born in [[Perugia]].  At an early age he became a local fascist leader in [[Umbria]] where he garnered a reputation as a member of the hard-line ''intransigenti'' wing of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Following the seizure of power Bastianini was appointed head of the ''Fasci Italiani all'Estero'', a movement aimed at co-ordinating the activities of Italian fascists not currently living in Italy. He called on members to seek to diffuse proper [[Italian fascism|Italian fascist]] ideas wherever they were living. This group gained a considerable following amongst Italian expatriates in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 1925 he submitted a report to the [[Fascist Grand Council]] claiming to have groups in 40 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, pp. 462–463&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastianini's activities brought him into conflict with Italian diplomats, who felt that his movement was overtly politicising their work. For his part Bastianini called for a complete reform of the diplomatic service, insisting that the only true Italians were also fascists and that therefore all diplomats should be convinced fascists.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; In the end [[Benito Mussolini]] pursued a middle ground by dismissing diplomats who had not declared for the [[National Fascist Party]] but also limiting the power of Bastianini's movement, which was taking on many of the functions of foreign affairs for itself, to ideological instruction, sport and charity work by restoring power to the Italian consuls.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, pp. 152–156&lt;/ref&gt; Bastianini resigned from his position as head of the ''Fasci Italiani all'Estero'' in late 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomat==
Somewhat inevitably following his drive to replace established diplomats with fascists Bastianini entered the diplomatic service himself. During the 1930s he was ambassador to [[Poland]] and as a consequence he was one of those who helped to convince Mussolini to delay entry into the [[Second World War]], knowing that [[Roman Catholic]] Poland was a country admired by many Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this time that he also served as ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dalmatia==
{{see also|Governorate of Dalmatia}}

In 1941 Bastianini was appointed [[Governor of Dalmatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Caracciolo, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; In this role Bastianini oversaw the deportation of a number of the region's Jews, including many refugees fleeing the German-occupied areas of [[Yugoslavia]], to concentration camps in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasevich, p. 597&lt;/ref&gt; Bastianini also established a policy of Italianisation, changing place names from [[Croatian language|Croatian]] to [[Italian language|Italian]], insisting that the press had to publish in Italian and bringing in a number of teachers from Italy to take lessons in Dalmatian schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jozo132&quot;&gt;Tomasevich, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; To those Croats who resented the changes he offered one piece of advice: emigrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jozo132&quot;/&gt;

Bastianini would spend the latter part of his period as governor in conflict with elements of the Italian military, in particular Generals [[Quirino Armellini]] and [[Mario Roatta]]. Armellini had concentrated his troops in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], a move Bastianini feared would breed fear and resentment amongst the inhabitants. Roatta declared that the civilian administration must have no saw in troop deployment although he and Bastianini eventually reached a compromise whereby local authorities would be consulted before large scale troop movements. Bastianini also managed to secure the removal of Armellini, with whom he did not get along.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasevich, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Bastianini was recalled in January 1943 after a government reshuffle in [[Rome]] and was replaced as governor the following month by [[Francesco Giunta]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomasevich, pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign Ministry==
He was appointed undersecretary at the Foreign Ministry in February 1943, effectively replacing [[Galeazzo Ciano]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan24&quot;&gt;Morgan, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini himself was the official [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Foreign Minister]] although his ill health and plethora of other roles meant that Bastianini effectively acted as minister.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; In his role he suggested two possible approaches that he felt could help to frustrate the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], although neither seemed likely to occur. On the one hand he felt that Mussolini could get [[Adolf Hitler]] to negotiate a settlement with the [[Soviet Union]] and that [[Germany|German]] forces could then be redeployed in Italy, a tactic that he felt would force the western Allies to accept a compromise peace settlement. His other idea was for Mussolini to convince Hitler to allow Italy to leave the war altogether and declare neutrality. Both suggestions however had no hope of success as Hitler would never be convinced and Mussolini had no desire to attempt to convince him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan24&quot;/&gt; Bastianini sold the notion of Mussolini as the man who could end the war to the governments of [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] and [[Hungary]] as these minor [[Axis powers]] were also desperate for an exit as they faced inevitable destruction at the hands of the advancing [[Red Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini's refusal to even attempt to reason with Hitler at the meeting held in [[Feltre]] with the German dictator on 19 July 1943 saw him challenged by Bastianini, [[Dino Alfieri]] and General [[Vittorio Ambrosio]] for his failure to try to get Italy out of the war. The incident damaged Mussolini's credibility and provided impetus to [[Dino Grandi]], who soon launched an attempt to oust Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Bastianini was present at the [[Fascist Grand Council]] meeting held on [[25 Luglio|July 25, 1943]] at which the mood was decidedly anti-Mussolini as Grandi made his play.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was not overly enthusiastic about the plot Bastianini stated that Mussolini had ruined Italy through his inaction and so gave Grandi his support.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless who refused to follow the likes of [[Giuseppe Bottai]] in being openly condemnatory of ''Il Duce'', preferring to continue to promote his aim of seeing Italy negotiating a separate peace as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastianini died in [[Milan]], aged 62.

'''Giuseppe &quot;Pino&quot; Greco''' (4 January 1952 &amp;ndash; September 1985) was a [[hitman]] and high-ranking member of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]]. A number of sources refer to him exclusively as '''Pino Greco''', although Giuseppe was his [[Christian name]]; &quot;Pino&quot; is a frequent abbreviation of the name Giuseppe.

One of the [[Most prolific murderers by number of victims|most prolific killers in criminal history]], he came from the [[Greco Mafia clan]], a prominent group from [[Ciaculli]] (he was a distant relative of [[Salvatore Greco &quot;Ciaschiteddu&quot;|Salvatore &quot;Ciaschiteddu&quot; Greco]].) His father was also a Mafioso nicknamed ''Scarpa'' ([[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] for &quot;shoe&quot;), hence Giuseppe's nickname of '''Scarpuzzedda''', or &quot;little shoe&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born in 1952 in Ciaculli, an outlying town in the [[province of Palermo]], administrative center of Sicily. At school he reportedly excelled in Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Follain, ''The last Godfathers'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known precisely when he joined the Mafia but by 1979 he sat on the [[Sicilian Mafia Commission]], which was ruled by his uncle, [[Michele Greco]], the boss of Ciaculli.

The Ciaculli cosca were closely allied with the [[Corleonesi]], and specifically with their bosses, [[Salvatore Riina]] and [[Bernardo Provenzano]], who would come to dominate the Sicilian Mafia in a violent Mafia war.

==Criminal career==
During the [[Second Mafia War]] from 1981 until 1983, orchestrated by the Corleonesi, Giuseppe Greco carried out dozens of murders, often with his favourite weapon, an [[AK-47]]. He was eventually convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' of 58 murders, most of them committed during the early 1980s, but it is believed he committed at least 80 murders in total&lt;ref&gt;Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', p.305&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly as many as 300.

Amongst those he gunned down are [[Stefano Bontade]], [[Salvatore Inzerillo]], [[Pio La Torre]] and [[Carabinieri]] General [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]]. He even murdered Inzerillo's fifteen-year-old son after the youth vowed to avenge his murdered father. Greco is rumoured to have chopped the boy's arm off before shooting him in the head and dissolving his corpse in acid.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', p.112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1981 he failed in his attempt to ambush and kill future ''[[pentito]]'' [[Salvatore Contorno]], and Contorno managed to shoot his would-be assassin in the chest, a [[bulletproof vest]] saving Greco's life.

He rarely worked alone, instead leading a &quot;death squad&quot; that included [[Mario Prestifilippo]], [[Filippo Marchese]], [[Vincenzo Puccio]], [[Gianbattista Pullarà]], [[Giuseppe Lucchese]], [[Raffaele Ganci]], [[Giuseppe Giacomo Gambino]] and [[Nino Madonia]]. Like Greco, they were all fugitives with numerous warrants issued for their arrest.

Greco worked particularly closely with Filippo Marchese, the boss of the Corso de Mille neighbourhood in Palermo and another close ally of the Corleonesi. Marchese ran the so-called &quot;Room of Death&quot;, a squalid [[Palermo]] shack in some wasteland where victims were tortured and murdered before being thrown into vats of [[acid]] or dismembered then dumped out in the [[Mediterranean]]. According to ''[[pentito]]'' [[Vincenzo Sinagra]], Greco helped Marchese carry out many killings there, he and Marchese [[garotte|garotting]] victims together, looping a length of rope round the victim's neck and each of them pulling on one end. Sinagra said it was usually his duty to hold the victim's kicking feet.

He strangled to death [[Rosario Riccobono]], a Palermo boss, in November 1982. Riccobono had been an ally of the Corleonesi, but when he had outlived his usefulness, Riina decided to have him eliminated. He invited Riccobono and eight of his men to a barbecue at Michele Greco's estate, at the end of which the nine guests were massacred by Giuseppe Greco and his team of killers. None of the bodies were ever found and were reportedly fed to pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1578712/Michele-Greco.html|title=Obituary of Michele Greco|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1982, Greco murdered Marchese on the orders of Riina. The Mafia War was dying down and Riina had decided Marchese was no longer of any use.

By then, Greco was believed to be the underboss of the Ciaculli family. Rather than delegate murders to his underlings, however, he continued to personally take part in them himself. On 29 July 1983, he planted and detonated the [[car bomb]] that killed [[magistrate]] [[Rocco Chinnici]] and three other people.

==Later years==
By the end of the Second Mafia War he was one of the most prominent of the new generation of Mafiosi who had distinguished themselves in the Second Mafia War, and reportedly acted like he was the boss of Ciaculli, whilst the actual boss, his uncle [[Michele Greco]], was in hiding. He had also built up a following of younger Mafiosi who looked up to him, even more so than they did to the Corleonesi bosses.&lt;ref name=follain169&gt;Follain, ''The last Godfathers'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Riina apparently felt the need to reduce the strength of the Ciaculli Family by eliminating its most prominent killers, starting with ''Scarpuzzedda''.

In order to weaken Greco’s position, Riina ordered the massacre of Piazza Scaffa, when eight people were killed in the Ciaculli [[mandamento]]. The victims were gunned down with shotguns in a barn. Greco was not informed as part of a deliberate strategy to show his lack of effective power over the territory under his jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his last crimes was leading a large hit-squad that ambushed and shot to death police investigator [[Antonino Cassarà]] on August 6, 1985. One of Cassarà's bodyguards also died and another was badly injured. Three years earlier, Cassarà had issued a report leading to the arrest of 163 prominent Mafiosi, including Giuseppe Greco, the members of his death squad, and Michele Greco.

==Death==
Sometime in September 1985, a month after Cassarà's assassination, Greco was murdered in his home. He was shot to death by his two fellow Mafiosi and supposed friends, [[Vincenzo Puccio]] and [[Giuseppe Lucchese]], although the orders came from Riina, who had felt Greco was getting too ambitious and too independently minded for his liking.&lt;ref&gt;Dickie, ''Cosa Nostra'', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Puccio was captured the following year for an unrelated murder and was himself murdered in his cell in 1989. Lucchese was captured in 1990 and imprisoned for other unrelated murders. Greco's elimination was the first of several by the Corleonesi in order to weaken the Ciaculli clan. Two years later one of Greco's accomplices and fellow Ciaculli killer Mario Prestifilippo was shot dead, reportedly also on Riina's orders.

Giuseppe Greco was given an ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' [[life sentence]] at the [[Maxi Trial]] of 1986-1987 after being found guilty of fifty-eight counts of murder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D81438F936A15756C0A96E948260|title=Mafia Killer Reported Slain|publisher=Reuters|date=25 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though he was dead by then. As a strategy to delay and weaken the reactions of Greco’s followers, Riina ordered the body to be dissolved in acid whilst in the meantime he told other Mafiosi that Greco was in hiding in the United States. Rumours of Greco's death surfaced in 1988 and these were only confirmed to the authorities by an [[informant]], [[Francesco Marino Mannoia]], the following year.

Francesco's brother, Agostino Marino Mannoia, was present at Greco's murder although only as a witness; he told his brother Francesco that he did not know the killing was due to take place. Agostino said that he was downstairs in Greco's house with another Mafioso whilst their host was upstairs talking with Puccio and Lucchese. After hearing shots, Agostino ran upstairs to see Greco lying dead and Puccio and Lucchese standing over him, the latter holding a smoking gun and subsequently explaining that he and Puccio had taken care of a problem on behalf of Riina.&lt;ref&gt;Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', p.306&lt;/ref&gt; Agostino explained all this to his brother Francesco, and it was Agostino's murder in early 1989 that prompted Francesco to become an informant.

Another informant who had been one of Greco's friends, [[Salvatore Cancemi]], subsequently told investigators that shortly after Greco's death Riina had approached him and explained to Cancemi: &quot;You know we've found the medicine for madmen?...We've killed &quot;Little Shoe&quot;; he'd become crazy.&quot;&lt;ref name=follain169/&gt;

'''Giuseppe Lucchese''' (born September 2, 1959) known as ''Occhi di ghiaccio'' (Eyes of ice) is a member of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] from the [[Brancaccio]] neighbourhood in [[Palermo]]. He was one of the favourite hitmen of the [[Corleonesi]], headed by [[Totò Riina]], during the [[Second Mafia War]] in 1981-83.

Lucchese and [[Vincenzo Puccio]] murdered their boss [[Giuseppe Greco|Giuseppe &quot;Pino&quot; Greco]] in 1985. Puccio replaced Greco and Lucchese became his substitute. After the killing of Puccio on May 11, 1989, Lucchese became the capo-[[mandamento]] of  the Ciaculli-Brancaccio mafia families.&lt;ref name=custodia&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.capitanoultimo.it/d/antimafiadoc3.htm Ordinanza di custodia cautelare in carcere], Tribunale di Caltanissetta, Ufficio del giudice per le indagini preliminari, April 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5736">'''Giuseppe &quot;Pino&quot; Schifilliti''' (born 1938) is a former prominent member of the [[DeCavalcante crime family]] since the 1980s, heavily involved in labour [[racketeering]] and [[extortion]] activities.

== Made by DeCavalcante ==

Toward the mid 1970s, Giuseppe Schifilliti was [[made man|inducted]] into the DeCavalcante crime family, under the leadership of [[Sam DeCavalcante|Simone &quot;Sam the Plumber&quot; DeCavalcante]] and early underboss, [[Giovanni Riggi|Giovanni &quot;John the Eagle&quot; Riggi]]. By starting out as a soldier, Schifilliti was hired in the same &quot;Laborers' International Union of North America&quot; at Local 1030, where he used to extort and bribe union officials to influence the power of the DeCavalcante crime family in construction sites, throughout the 1970s, alongside Riggi, who was then seen as the new boss of the family.

== Caporegime by Riggi ==

During the early 1980s, Giovanni Riggi was in total charge of the DeCavalcante crime family, as he promoted Schifilliti to the rank of ''[[caporegime]]'' or Captain within the family. Operating out of the [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] faction, Schifilliti became a top member of the family alongside [[Girolamo Palermo|Girolamo &quot;Jimmy&quot; Palermo]] and [[Stefano Vitabile|Stefano &quot;Steve the Truck Driver&quot; Vitabile]], with labor and construction [[racketeering]], [[extortion]], [[illegal gambling]], [[loansharking]] and [[money laundering]] as criminal activities. Schifilliti also reputedly went under the radar, and operated with huge muscle throughout the 1980s, and early 1990s without a single indictment.

== LaRasso and D'Amato ==

In 1989, Riggi and several others were tried for racketeering and extortion charges, as well as internal rivalry was brought up between the [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and Elizabeth factions of the family. In 1990, Riggi was convicted on the charges and he was sentenced to 15 years. To make sure everyone knew he still ran the family, he made Schifilliti and [[consigliere]] Stefano Vitabile, to organize the murder of former underboss, [[Louis LaRasso|Louis &quot;Fat Lou&quot; LaRasso]], who was reported missing in 1991, as well as rumors went around [[North Jersey]] that the current acting boss, [[John D'Amato|John &quot;Johnny Boy&quot; D'Amato]] was gay, and was found murdered in his car later in 1992. Schifilliti was reportedly involved in both cases, as he cooperated much with Vitabile and the imprisoned Riggi.

== Indictments &amp; trials ==

In 2000, internal rivalry almost brought a new war to the streets of [[New Jersey]], as prominent acting boss [[Vincent Palermo|Vincent &quot;Vinny Ocean&quot; Palermo]] was eager to control the entire DeCavalcante crime family, as he organized the attempted murder of rival [[Charles Majuri|Charles &quot;Big Ears&quot; Majuri]], but failed to kill him. Later, an indictment wave of a four-year-investigation put 50 members and associates of the DeCavalcante crime family on trial, including prominent members Schifilliti, Palermo, Stefano Vitabile, Girolamo Palermo and [[Philip Abramo|Philip &quot;Phil&quot; Abramo]], with labor racketeering, loansharking, extortion, fraud, illegal gambling, murder and conspiracy to commit murder charges. As that wasn't enough, Vincent Palermo decided to turn state's evidence, as did capo [[Anthony Rotondo]] and soldier [[Anthony Capo]], over the next year due to the indictments. Schifilliti was held against bail, and due to his age, put under house arrest and put on trial in late 2001, and 2002.

== Current status ==

Schifilliti was tried with Vitabile and Abramo on two counts of murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder. The charges were picked up from the following disappearing of Louis LaRasso and the murder of John D'Amato, both in 1991, including the attempted murder of Charles Majuri. Schifilliti was convicted of racketeering, loansharking and extortion in 2003, as well as being convicted along with Vitabile and Abramo on the murder and conspiracy charges from the 1990s in late 2005. In 2006, Schifilliti was sentenced to life imprisonment along with Vitabile and Abramo.

In September 2008, a federal appeals court reversed Schifilliti's racketeering conviction and ordered a new trial.

'''Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Zangara''' (September 7, 1900&amp;nbsp;– March 20, 1933) was the [[assassination|assassin]] of [[Anton Cermak]], the [[Mayor of Chicago|Mayor]] of [[Chicago]]. Zangara was an [[Italy|Italian]] American [[anarchism|anarchist]] who shot Cermak and four others in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], on February 15, 1933, during a speech by [[President of the United States|United States President]][[President-elect of the United States|–elect]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt himself may have been the intended target but was unharmed.{{sfn|Boertlein|2010|pp=48–49}}

== Early life ==
Zangara was born on September 7, 1900, in [[Ferruzzano]], [[Calabria]], [[Italy]]. After serving in the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]ean Alps in [[World War I]], he did a variety of menial jobs in his home village before emigrating with his uncle to the [[United States]] in 1923. He settled in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], and  became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1929.

== Physical and mental health problems ==
Zangara was a man with little education who became a [[bricklayer]]. He suffered severe pain in his [[abdomen]], which was later attributed to [[adhesions]] of the [[gall bladder]]. This condition possibly originated from an [[appendectomy]] performed in 1926. These adhesions were later cited as a cause for his increasing mental delusions, and it became increasingly difficult for him to work owing to his physical and mental disabilities.

==Assassination attempt==
On February 15, 1933, Roosevelt was giving an impromptu speech at night from the back of an open car in the [[Bayfront Park]] area of [[Miami, Florida]], where Zangara was working the occasional odd job and living off his savings. Zangara, armed with a [[.32 S&amp;W|.32-caliber]] [[Iver Johnson|US Revolver Company]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbott2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Abbott|title=What a Way to Go: The Guillotine, the Pendulum, the Thousand Cuts, the Spanish Donkey, and 66 Other Ways of Putting Someone to Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suNPDerI7-kC&amp;pg=PA99|date=17 April 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-36656-8|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt; pistol he had bought for $8 at a local [[pawn shop]], joined the crowd. 

However, standing only five feet tall, he was unable to see over other people and had to stand on a wobbly metal folding chair, peering over the hat of Lillian Cross to get a clear aim at his target.{{sfn|McCann|2006|p=70}} After the first shot, Cross and others grabbed his arm, and he fired four more shots wildly. Five people were hit, including Chicago mayor [[Anton Cermak]], who was standing on the running board of the car next to Roosevelt, who was untouched. Roosevelt cradled Cermak in his arms as the car rushed to the hospital. After arriving there, Cermak spoke to Roosevelt and allegedly uttered the line that is engraved on his tomb: &quot;I'm glad it was me instead of you.&quot; The Tribune reported the quote without attributing it to a witness, and most scholars doubt it was ever said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benzkofer|first=Stephen||date=February 10, 2013|title= 'Tell Chicago I'll pull through': In 1933, a bullet meant for FDR hit Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak instead|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-02-10/news/ct-per-flash-cermak-shot-0210-20130210_1_band-shell-chicago-mayor-anton-cermak-bullet|newspaper=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt escaped injury, but had he been [[Assassination|assassinated]], then Vice President–elect [[John Nance Garner]] would have become [[President of the United States|president]] on [[United States presidential inauguration|March 4, 1933]], pursuant to Section 3 of the recently ratified [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

== Aftermath ==
Zangara confessed in the [[Miami-Dade County|Dade County]] Courthouse jail, stating: &quot;I have the gun in my hand. I kill kings and presidents first and next all capitalists.&quot; He pleaded guilty to four counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to 80 years in prison. As he was led out of the courtroom, Zangara told the judge: &quot;Four times 20 is 80. Oh, judge, don't be stingy. Give me a hundred years.&quot; The judge, E.C. Collins, replied: &quot;Maybe there will be more later&quot; in reference to two additional charges of murder that had been entered against Zangara in case one (or both) of his most severely injured victims, Cermak and local resident Mabel Gill, were to die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami-history.com/attempted-assassination-of-fdr-in-bayfront-park/ Miami History: Attempted Assassination of FDR in Bayfront Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cermak died of [[peritonitis]] 19 days later, on March 6, 1933, two days after Roosevelt’s [[inauguration]]. Zangara was promptly indicted for [[first-degree murder]] in Cermak’s death. Because Zangara had intended to commit murder, it was irrelevant that his intended target may not have been the man he ultimately killed, nor that Cermak's death was in part the result of [[medical malpractice]]. In either case, he would still be guilty of first-degree murder under the doctrine of [[transferred intent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dc.state.fl.us/oth/timeline/1933-1935.html Florida Department of Corrections: 1933-1935]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zangara pleaded guilty to the additional murder charge and was sentenced to death by Circuit Court Judge Uly Thompson. Zangara said after hearing his sentence: “You give me [[electric chair]]. I no afraid of that chair! You one of capitalists. You is crook man too. Put me in electric chair. I no care!”{{sfn|Hernandez|2004}} Under Florida law, a convicted murderer could not share cell space with another prisoner before his execution, but another convicted murderer was already awaiting execution at Raiford. Zangara’s sentence required prison officials to expand their waiting area, and the “death cell” became “[[Death Row]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Willard and Marion, Nancy. Killing the President: Assassinations, Attempts, and Rumored Attempts on U.S. Commanders in Chief. Page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

== Execution ==
On March 20, 1933, after spending only 10 days on death row, Zangara was executed in [[Old Sparky]], the [[electric chair]] at [[Union Correctional Institution|Florida State Prison]] in [[Raiford, Florida|Raiford]]. Zangara became enraged when he learned no [[newsreel]] cameras would be filming his final moments. Zangara's final statement was &quot;Viva l'Italia! Goodbye to all poor peoples everywhere!... Push the button! Go ahead, push the button!&quot;{{sfn|An Assassin's Bullets for FDR|p=14}}

== Motivations ==
While most accounts for years repeated that Cermak was the unintended victim of an attempt to assassinate Roosevelt, more recent theories, especially in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kass |first=John |author-link=John_Kass |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-07/news/ct-met-kass-0307-20130307_1_chicago-way-anton-cermak-chicago-politics |title=Cermak's death offers lesson in Chicago Way |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2015-04-09 |quote=Chicagoans don't believe in coincidences ... when coincidences involve Chicago politics and the Chicago Outfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that Zangara was a hired killer working for [[Frank Nitti]], who was the head of the [[Chicago Outfit]] (Chicago's largest organized crime syndicate). John William Tuohy, author of numerous books on organized crime in Chicago, after reviewing Secret Service records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Gus|author-link=Gus_Russo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnCn1u-zHbQC |title=The Outfit: The Role of Chicago's Underworld in the Shaping of Modern America |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |year=2008 |pages=92–96 |isbn=978-1596918979 |accessdate=2015-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has described in detail how and why Cermak was the real target and the relationship of the shooting to the rampant gang violence in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_200.html |title=The Guns Of Zangara: Part Three of Three |last=Touhy |first=John William |work=AmericanMafia.com |date=March 2002 |accessdate=2015-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous researchers, citing court testimony, assert that Cermak had directed an assassination attempt on Nitti less than three months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allanrmay.com/First_Shooting_of_Nitti.html |title=The First Shooting of Frank Nitti |last=May |first=Allan |date=1999 |accessdate=2015-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_197.html |title=The Guns Of Zangara: Part One of Three |last=Touhy |first=John William |work=AmericanMafia.com |date=March 2002 |accessdate=2015-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725055310/http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_197.html |archivedate=2013-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point is that Zangara had been an expert marksman in the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] (though not with a pistol from a great distance) and would presumably hit his target.{{sfn|Sifakis|1987|p=}}{{page needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Raymond Moley]] interviewed Zangara and believed he was not part of any larger plot, and that he had intended to kill Roosevelt.

==In popular culture==
{{copyedit|section|date=December 2016}}
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2016}}
In the original [[Off-Broadway]] production of ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'' by [[Stephen Sondheim]], Zangara was played by [[Eddie Korbich]]. In later productions, he was played by Paul Harrhy in London and by Jeffrey Kuhn in the show's original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Appearing in several songs from the play, he has a major solo in the number &quot;How I Saved Roosevelt.&quot;

Zangara plays a significant role in the background provided for [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]''. The [[alternate history]] novel, set after an [[Axis victory in World War II]], uses the premise that Zangara succeeded in assassinating FDR as its [[point of divergence]]. (The death of FDR is later said to have happened after he was President for one year; this may be an error on Dick's part or a sign of additional divergences in the timeline.) The same premise is used in [[Eric Norden]]'s ''[[The Ultimate Solution]]'' (1972) and the GURPS Alternate Earths role playing game's &quot;Reich 5&quot; alternate universe.

In 1960, in a two-part story line titled 'The Unhired Assassin' on the TV show ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', actor [[Joe Mantell]] played the part of Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Zangara. This episode, while depicting Zangara's story throughout, focuses mostly on Nitti's plan to kill Mayor Cermak with an initial (fictionalized) attempt in Chicago that is foiled by Ness and his agents at the end of part one. Then, in part two, another attempt is made using a contract hitman, an ex-Army rifleman in Florida, which again fails thanks to [[Eliot Ness]] (played by [[Robert Stack]]). But Ness's successful prevention of Nitti's assassination plot is quickly undercut when Zangara does the deed. Zangara is depicted as having nothing to do with Nitti's plot and as being obsessed only with killing Roosevelt. The shows were originally aired February 25 and March 3, 1960. This two-part story was later edited together as a feature-length movie retitled &quot;The Gun of Zangara.&quot;

[[Max Allan Collins]]' 1983 novel ''True Detective'', first in the Nathan Heller mystery series, features Zangara's attempted assassination of Roosevelt, positing it as an actual attempt on Anton Cermak, Chicago's mayor at the time. The novel won the 1984 Shamus Award for Best P.I. Hardcover from the Private Eye Writers of America.

The 2011 fantasy noir novel ''Spellbound'' by [[Larry Correia]] features Zangara's attempted assassination of FDR. Zangara is magically enhanced in a plot to inflame bigotry and curtail the civil rights of the magically gifted protagonists of the Grimnoir Society. Instead of using a small-caliber handgun, Zangara is made into a living cannon or bomb and kills nearly 200 onlookers, including Mayor Cermak, and cripples Roosevelt.

In the second season of the HBO drama ''[[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)|The Newsroom]]'', lead character Will McAvoy (played by Jeff Daniels) uses Zangara's attempt to assassinate Roosevelt as an example of how one thing can change everything. He describes how if the chair Zangara had been using hadn't been wobbly, he would have succeeded in killing Roosevelt. Roosevelt's running mate, John Nance Garner, who opposed the New Deal, would have been elected. Thus, if not for a wobbly chair, America would not have survived the Great Depression.

'''''Gladiator''''' is a 2000 British-American [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical period drama|historical drama film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]].  It stars [[Russell Crowe]], [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Ralf Möller]], [[Oliver Reed]] (in his final film role before his death), [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[John Shrapnel]], and [[Richard Harris]]. Crowe portrays the fictional character, loyal [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when [[Commodus]], the ambitious son of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.

The film was released in the United States on May 5, 2000, and grossed $457.6 million worldwide.  The film won multiple awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Crowe, and three other [[Academy Awards]] at the [[73rd Academy Awards]].  It has also been credited with rekindling interest in films centered around [[Culture of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]].

==Plot==

In [[Anno Domini|AD]] 180, [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] General Maximus Decimus Meridius leads the [[Roman army]] to a decisive victory against the [[Germania|Germanic]] tribes near [[Vindobona]] on the [[Limes Germanicus|northern frontier]]. Now weary of battle, Maximus only desires to retire to his Spanish farm estate. But Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] tells him that his own son and heir, [[Commodus]], is unfit to rule and that he will appoint Maximus as regent to help save Rome from corruption. When the Emperor reveals his plan to his son, Commodus murders him in a fit of rage.

Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty. When the general refuses, he is arrested by his officers and is sentenced to death at dawn. Maximus kills his captors and rides for his farm. However, he arrives too late, and finds it destroyed and his family murdered, by Commodus' orders. Maximus buries his wife and son, and then collapses from his wounds and grief. He is found by slavers who take him to [[Zuccabar|Zucchabar]], a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] in the Roman [[North Africa]]n province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], where he is sold to a [[lanista]] ([[gladiator]] trainer) named Proximo.

Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other [[gladiator]]s: Juba, a [[Numidia]]n who holds onto Maximus's figurines of his wife and child, and Hagen, a [[Germanic peoples|German]]. As he wins every match because of his military skills and indifference to death, he gains fame and recognition. But Proximo, who reveals that he himself was once a gladiator who fought well enough to be given his freedom, advises Maximus that being a good killer is not enough; a good gladiator is one who can &quot;win the crowd&quot;. Proximo encourages Maximus to go to Rome and fight in the [[Colosseum]], because Commodus has organized 150 days of games. He could then use the power he commands in the arena as leverage against the Emperor.

Maximus' first gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum is a re-enactment of the Roman victory over [[Carthage]] at the [[Battle of Zama]]. Although the gladiators (portraying the [[Sacred Band of Carthage|Carthaginians]]) are expected to be massacred, Maximus leads them to victory over the legionaries of [[Scipio Africanus]]. This prompts a surprised and delighted Commodus to enter the arena to offer his personal congratulations. When the emperor's young nephew, Lucius, also joins them, Maximus decides not to kill Commodus. Instead he reveals himself and vows to have vengeance. The [[Praetorian Guard]] is ordered to attack but this angers the crowd. Under pressure to keep the mob of Rome happy, Commodus angrily relents.

Maximus' next fight is a victory against a large undefeated gladiator. Despite Commodus's orders to kill the loser, Maximus spares his defeated opponent's life. This defiance earns him the nickname &quot;Maximus the Merciful&quot; and more cheers of adulation. Angered at this outcome, Commodus enters the arena to taunt Maximus about his family's death. But the gladiator turns his back and walks away, another defiant act that is making him more popular than the Emperor.

Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former [[Roman legion|legions]] remain loyal. [[Lucilla]], Commodus' sister, and Gracchus, from the [[Senate of the Roman Empire|Senate]], meet secretly with Maximus. He obtains their promise to help him escape Rome, rejoin his soldiers, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the [[Roman Senate]]. However, Commodus learns of the plot from Lucilla by threatening her son Lucius. The Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus while others are sent to the gladiators' barracks. Maximus escapes after Proximo and his men (including Hagen) sacrifice themselves. But at the rendezvous point, Maximus is captured and Cicero is killed.

To win the crowd back, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. However, he secretly stabs Maximus in the side before the match to gain an advantage. Nevertheless Maximus eventually disarms Commodus during their duel. When his Praetorian Guards refuse to give him another sword, the emperor tricks Maximus into disarming and produces a hidden knife, but Maximus drives the blade back into Commodus's throat. Maximus, however, succumbs to his wounds shortly thereafter.

Maximus's last words are to ask for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. While the body of Commodus is left unceremoniously on the floor of the arena, Maximus is solemnly carried away by his friends and allies to be given an honorable funeral as a &quot;soldier of Rome&quot;. The crowd stands as a sign of respect as Maximus is carried out.

Later, a now-free Juba revisits the Colosseum at night. He buries the figurines of Maximus' wife and son at the spot where he died. He says he is now going back to his own family and promises to see Maximus again, &quot;but not yet&quot;.

==Cast==

Maximus is a fictional character partly inspired by [[Marcus Nonius Macrinus]], [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]], [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]], and [[Maximus of Hispania]]. [[Mel Gibson]] was first offered the role,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/gladiator-re.html| title=The New York Times: Best Pictures| newspaper=New York Times| date= May 5, 2000 | author=Elvis Mitchell| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but declined as he felt he was too old to play the character. [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Hugh Jackman]] were also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://screencrush.com/gladiator-then-and-now/| title=See the Cast of 'Gladiator' Then and Now| newspaper=Screencrush.com| date=June 13, 2013 | author= Britt Hayes| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Screenplay===
''Gladiator'' was based on an original pitch by [[David Franzoni]], who wrote the first draft.&lt;ref name=Stax&gt;{{Citation|title=The Stax Report's ''Five Scribes'' Edition|author=Stax|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/356/356712p1.html|publisher=IGN|date=April 4, 2002|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franzoni was given a three-picture deal with [[DreamWorks]] as writer and co-producer on the strength of his previous work, [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', which helped establish the reputation of DreamWorks. Not a classical scholar, Franzoni was inspired by [[Daniel P. Mannix]]'s 1958 novel ''Those About to Die,'' and he chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ''[[Augustan History]]''. In Franzoni's first draft, dated April 4, 1998, he named his protagonist [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]], a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources [[Herodian]] and [[Cassius Dio]], strangled Emperor Commodus to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;FilmHistoryWinkler&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Gladiator: Film and History|editor=Martin M. Winkler|chapter=Gladiator from Screenplay to Screen|author=Jon Solomon|publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=April 1, 2004|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several dead men and various scattered weapons are located in a large arena. Near the center of the image is a man wearing armor standing in the middle of an arena looking up at a large crowd. The man has his right foot on the throat of an injured man who is reaching towards the crowd. Members of the crowd are indicating a &quot;thumbs down&quot; gesture. The arena is adorned with marble, columns, flags, and statues.|''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)]]'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], the 19th century painting that inspired Ridley Scott to tackle the project]]

[[Ridley Scott]] was approached by producers [[Walter Parkes|Walter F. Parkes]] and [[Douglas Wick]]. They showed him a copy of [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]'s 1872 painting entitled ''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was enticed by filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, Scott felt Franzoni's dialogue was too &quot;on the nose&quot; (lacking subtlety) and hired [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's motivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;scribes&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Tales of the Scribes: Story Development|medium=DVD|publisher=Universal|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell Crowe]] describes being eager for the role as pitched by Walter F. Parkes, in his interview for ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'': &quot;They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman General.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaspinet.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaspinet.com/Inside_The_Actors_Studio-Transcript.htm|title=Inside The Actors Studio - Transcript|work=kaspinet.com|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With two weeks to go before filming, the actors complained of problems with the script. [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]] was brought to [[Shepperton Studios]] to make Maximus a more sensitive character.  Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying &quot;he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scribes&quot;/&gt;

The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions. Crowe allegedly questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to a DreamWorks executive, &quot;(Russell Crowe) tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corliss2000&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=The Empire Strikes Back|first1=Richard|last1=Corliss|first2=Jeffrey|last2=Ressner|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996847-2,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 8, 2000|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell Crowe described the script situation: &quot;I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaspinet.com&quot;/&gt;

Of the writing and filming process, Crowe added, &quot;Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my quote unquote volatility has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it – what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaspinet.com&quot;/&gt;

===Pre-production===
In preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 61&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to high costs and unavailability of the items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 66&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred suits of steel armour and 550 suits in polyurethane were made by Rod Vass and his company Armordillo. The unique sprayed-polyurethane system was developed by Armordillo and pioneered for this production. Over a three-month period, 27,500 component pieces of armor were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.themovienetwork.com/article/motw-sic-semper-illuminatus-five-fun-facts-about-gladiator| title=MOTW: Sic Semper Illuminatus: Five Fun Facts about &quot;Gladiator&quot;| newspaper=Themovienetwork.com| date=February 26, 2013 | author=| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the [[Bourne Wood]]s, near [[Farnham]], [[Surrey]], in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 62&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Scott learned that the [[Forestry Commission]] planned to remove a section of the forest, he persuaded them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 68&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a [[Rotary disc shutter|45-degree shutter]], creating [[stop motion]] effects in the action sequences, similar to techniques used for the battle sequences of ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bankston2000&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Bankston|first=Douglas|date=May 2000|title=Death or Glory|journal=American Cinematographer|publisher=American Society of Cinematographers|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine/may00/pg1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the scenes of slavery, desert travel, and gladiatorial training school were shot in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 63&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 73&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the scenes of Ancient Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in [[Fort Ricasoli]], Malta.&lt;ref name=Kodak_inCamera&gt;{{Citation|title=Gory glory in the Colosseum|url=http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/july2000/gladiator.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209185727/http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/july2000/gladiator.shtml|archivedate=2005-02-09|publisher=Kodak: In Camera|date=July 2000|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mfc&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Malta Film Commission&amp;nbsp;– Backlots |url=http://mfc.com.mt/page.asp?p=14388&amp;l=1 |publisher=Malta Film Commission |accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malta, a replica of about one-third of Rome's Colosseum was built, to a height of 52 feet (15.8 meters), mostly from plaster and plywood (the other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally).&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 89&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replica took several months to build and cost an estimated $1 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler p130&quot;&gt;Winkler, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse side of the complex supplied a rich assortment of Ancient Roman street furniture, [[colonnade]]s, [[gate]]s, [[statue|statuary]], and marketplaces for other filming requirements. The complex was serviced by tented &quot;costume villages&quot; that had changing rooms, storage, armorers, and other facilities.&lt;ref name=Kodak_inCamera/&gt; The rest of the Colosseum was created in [[computer-generated imagery]] using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment|Flame]] and [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment|Inferno]] software.&lt;ref name=TheMill&gt;{{Citation|last=Bath| first=Matthew|title=The Mill|url=http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/creative-lifestyle/mill/|publisher=Digit Magazine|date=October 25, 2004|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
[[File:cityrome.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Men in white robes with the Colosseum in the background.|Several scenes included extensive use of computer-generated imagery shots for views of Rome.]]
British post-production company [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]] was responsible for much of the computer-generated imagery effects that were added after filming. The company was responsible for such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming.

==Historical authenticity==

===Development===
The film is loosely based on real events that occurred within the [[Roman Empire]] in the latter half of the 2nd century AD. As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Nevertheless, some deviations from historical fact were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were &quot;too unbelievable&quot; to include. For instance in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out [[Testimonial|product endorsements]] in the arena; while this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035289p1.html Not Such a Wonderful Life: A Look at History in Gladiator] IGN movies February 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits (though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, &quot;where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?&quot;). Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made ''Gladiator'' less interesting or exciting because &quot;creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last =Ward|first =Allen|date =May 2001|title =The Movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; in Historical Perspective|work =[[University of Connecticut]]|url =http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/wardgladiator1.html|accessdate =December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GladFilmH&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Winkler|first=Martin |title=Gladiator Film and History|year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-1042-2|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictionalization===
[[Marcus Aurelius]] died at [[Vindobona]] (a Roman camp on the site of modern-day [[Vienna]] in [[Austria]]) in 180 AD; he was not murdered by his son Commodus following the final battle of the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. In reality Marcus Aurelius shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone from that point onward.

The character of Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resembles the historical figures [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]] (Commodus's real-life murderer and the character's name in the first draft of the screenplay),&lt;ref name=&quot;exovedate&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Gladiator: The Real Story|url=http://www.exovedate.com/the_real_gladiator_one.html|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spartacus]] (who led a significant slave revolt in 73-71 BC), [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]] (519-430 BC) (a farmer who became dictator, saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month appointment after 15 days),&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_c&quot;&gt;[[Livy]].

Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web|title=GLADIATOR: THE REAL STORY|author=|url=http://www.exovedate.com/the_real_gladiator_one.html|publisher=|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Commodus|author=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9024967/Commodus|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Maximus had a similar career (and personality traits as documented by [[Herodian]]) to [[Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus|Claudius Pompeianus]] (a [[Syria]]n) who married [[Marcus Aurelius]]' daughter [[Lucilla]] following the death of [[Lucius Verus]]. It is believed Aurelius may have wanted Pompeianus to succeed him as [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] in preference to Commodus but was turned down. Pompeianus had no part in any of the many plots against Commodus. He was not depicted in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward&quot;/&gt;

In the film the character Antonius Proximo claims &quot;the wise&quot; Marcus Aurelius banned gladiatorial games in Rome forcing him to move to [[Mauretania]]. The real Marcus did ban the games but only in [[Antioch]] as punishment for the city's support of the usurper [[Avidius Cassius]]. No games were ever banned in Rome. However, when the Emperor started conscripting gladiators into the legions, the resulting shortage in fighters allowed ''[[lanista]]e'' such as Proximo to make &quot;windfall&quot; profits through increased charges for their services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler&quot;/&gt;

In real life, the death of Commodus did not result in a peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] of AD 193. According to Herodian, the people of Rome were overjoyed at the news of Commodus dying, although they feared that the praetorians would not accept the new emperor Pertinax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Echols|first1=Edward|title=Herodian 2.2 - Livius|url=http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodian-s-roman-history/herodian-2.2/|website=Livius, Articles on ancient history|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anachronisms===
Costumes within the film are almost never completely historically correct. Some of the soldiers wear [[Galea (helmet)|fantasy helmets]]. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely ever worn. Their appearance is the product of historical movies always depicting peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the [[Lorica segmentata|Imperial Gallic armor]] and the [[Imperial helmet#Imperial Gallic|helmets]] worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by [[Imperial helmet#Imperial Italic|new design]]s in AD 100. Likewise the Legions' [[Aquilifer|standard bearers (Aquilifer)]], [[centurion]]s, [[Roman cavalry|mounted forces]], and [[auxilia]]ries would have worn scale armour: [[Lorica squamata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kelly &amp; Robert Douglas Smith|last=DeVries|title=Medieval Weapons: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|pages=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jdcrsCOB-VcC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Lorica%20squamata&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=Lorica%20squamata&amp;f=false 24–27]|isbn=9781851095261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid1/student_projects97/armour/scale/scale.html|title=Scale (Lorica Squamata)|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic tribes are dressed in clothes from the stone-age period.&lt;ref&gt;Junkelmann, Marcus in ''Hollywoods Traum von Rom'' (Hollywood’s Dream of Rome), p. 117, 120 and 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman cavalry]] are shown attacking using [[stirrup]]s. This is anachronistic in that the horse-mounted forces of the [[Roman army]] used a two-horned saddle. Stirrups were only employed for safety reasons because of the additional training and skill required to ride with a Roman saddle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Winkler | first = Martin M. | year = 2004 | title = Gladiator: film and history | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location =  | isbn = 1-4051-1042-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Movie Nitpick: Gladiator |url=http://www.nitpickers.com/movies/nitpick.cgi?np=16281|publisher=The Nitpickers Site |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catapult]]s and [[ballista]]e would not have been used in a forest. They were reserved primarily for [[siege]]s and were rarely used in open battles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler&quot;/&gt;

The Praetorian Guards seen in the film are all wearing black uniforms. No historical evidence supports that. On Campaign they usually wore standard legionary equipment albeit with some unique decorative elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Praetorian Guard (Elite)|last=Rankov|first=Boris|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bird's eye view of Rome when the city is introduced for the first time there are several buildings that did not exist at the time of ''Gladiator''. For example, the [[Basilica of Maxentius|Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine]] is quite prominent; however, it was not completed until AD 312.

==Influences==
The film's plot was influenced by two 1960s [[Hollywood]] films of the [[Peplum film genre|sword-and-sandal]] genre, ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Scholia Reviews ns 14 (2005) 11.|author=Martin M. Winkler|url=http://www.classics.und.ac.za/reviews/05-11win.htm|publisher=|date=June 23, 2002|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares several plot points with ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', which tells the story of Livius, who, like Maximus in ''Gladiator,'' is Marcus Aurelius's intended successor. Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned; in ''Gladiator'' Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. In the course of ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in ''Gladiator'', when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him. Livius in ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' and Maximus in ''Gladiator'' kill Commodus in single combat, Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his wife and son, and both do it for the greater good of Rome.

Scott cited ''Spartacus'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' as influences on the film: &quot;These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years&amp;nbsp;– if not all recorded history&amp;nbsp;– the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spartacus'' provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator (bearing the name of a pair of revolutionary [[Tribune]]s from the 2nd century BC) who in both films is an elder statesman of [[ancient Rome]] attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious [[Autocracy|autocrat]]&amp;nbsp;–[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in ''Spartacus'' and Commodus in ''Gladiator.'' Both actors who played Gracchus (in ''Spartacus'' and ''Gladiator''), played [[Claudius]] in previous films&amp;nbsp;– [[Charles Laughton]] of ''Spartacus'' played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'' and Sir [[Derek Jacobi]] of ''Gladiator'', played Claudius in [[I, Claudius (TV series)|the 1976 BBC adaptation]]. Both films also share a specific set piece, wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, [[Woody Strode]]'s Draba in ''Spartacus'') throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: &quot;Rome is the mob&quot;, said here by Gracchus and by [[Julius Caesar]] ([[John Gavin]]) in ''Spartacus''.

The film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s [[Nazism|Nazi]] propaganda film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the [[iconography]] of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. ''Gladiator'' reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his [[chariot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler p114&quot;&gt;Winkler, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; The first thing to appear in ''Triumph of the Will'' is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene) leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler p115&quot;&gt;Winkler, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oscar-nominated score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Lisa Gerrard]], and conducted by [[Gavin Greenaway]]. Zimmer was originally planning to use Israeli vocalist [[Ofra Haza]] for the score, after his work with her in ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]''. However, Ofra died in her early 40s in late February 2000, before she was able to record, and so Gerrard was chosen instead.

===Accolades===
{{Main|List of accolades received by Gladiator}}
''Gladiator'' was nominated in 36 individual ceremonies, including the [[73rd Academy Awards]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Awards]], and the [[Golden Globe Awards]]. Of 119 award nominations, the film won 48 prizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/awards|title=Gladiator awards tally|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won five Academy Awards and was nominated for an additional seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay#2000s|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score#2000s|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Academy Award for Best Directing#2000s|Best Director]] for Ridley Scott. It was the first movie to win Best Picture without winning either a directing or screenwriting award since ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King's Men]]'' at the [[22nd Academy Awards]] in 1950. In [[75th Academy Awards|2003]], ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' became another Best Picture winner which didn't win an Academy Award in either of these two major categories. Due to [[Academy Awards|Academy]] rules, only [[Hans Zimmer]] was officially nominated for [[Academy Award for Original Music Score#2000s|Best Music, Original Score]], and not to [[Lisa Gerrard]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/gladiator.html| title=Filmtracks: Gladiator (Hans Zimmer/Lisa Gerrard)| newspaper=Filmtracks.com| date= May 5, 2000| author=| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pair did win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] as co-composers.

==Impact==
The film's mainstream success is responsible for an increased interest in Roman and classical history in the United States. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', this has been dubbed the &quot;Gladiator Effect&quot;.

{{quote|It's called ''the 'Gladiator' effect'' by writers and publishers. The snob in us likes to believe that it is always books that spin off movies. Yet in this case, it's the movies&amp;nbsp;– most recently ''Gladiator'' two years ago&amp;nbsp;– that have created the interest in the ancients. And not for more Roman screen colossals, but for writing that is serious or fun or both.&quot;&lt;ref name=nytg/&gt;}}

The [[Cicero]] biography ''Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician'' and Gregory Hays's translation of [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' received large spikes in sales after the release of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytg&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Martin|first=Arnold|title=Making Books; Book Parties With Togas|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 11, 2002|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D61530F932A25754C0A9649C8B63|accessdate=February 27, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117055645/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D61530F932A25754C0A9649C8B63 |archivedate = January 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also began a revival of the historical epic genre with films such as ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'', ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]'', ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (the last two were also directed by Scott).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2004&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=The 15 Most Influential Films of Our Lifetime|publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''|page=115|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Maximus was placed 12th in the ''[[Total Film]]'' list of 50 best movie heroes and villains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/the-50-greatest-movie-heroes-and-baddies-of-all-time-revealed_1006810.html |title=The 50 greatest movie heroes and baddies of all time revealed |publisher=Thaindian.com |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 35th in the [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']]'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=35 The 100 Greatest Movie Characters] ''Empire''&lt;/ref&gt; Maximus is also featured on 55[[Cent (currency)|c]] &quot;Australian Legends&quot; postage stamp series.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7867661.stm|format=|title= Oscar winning Aussies go postal|publisher = BBC News|author= |accessdate=2010-01-13 | date=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Crowe attended a ceremony to mark the creation of the stamps.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;

==Home media==
The film was first released on [[DVD]] on November 21, 2000, and has since been released in several different extended and special edition versions. Special features for the [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] and DVDs include [[deleted scene]]s, [[trailer (promotion)|trailers]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]], [[Audio commentary|commentaries]], [[storyboard]]s, image galleries, [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]], and [[audition|cast auditions]]. The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2009, in a 2-disc edition containing both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, as part of Paramount's &quot;Sapphire Series&quot; (Paramount bought the DreamWorks library in 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;blu-ray&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=4735|title=Gladiator|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reviews of the Blu-ray Disc release criticized poor image quality, leading many to call for it to be remastered, as Sony did with ''[[The Fifth Element]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;bigscreen&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bigscreen.com/journal.php?id=1632|title=Initial &quot;Gladiator&quot; Blu-ray Reviews Report Picture Quality Issues|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remastered version was later released in 2010.

The DVD editions that have been released since the original two-disc version, include a film only single-disc edition as well as a three-disc &quot;extended edition&quot; DVD which was released in August 2005. The extended edition DVD features approximately fifteen minutes of additional scenes, most of which appear in the previous release as deleted scenes. The original cut, which Scott still calls his director's cut, is also select-able via [[seamless branching]] (which is not included on the UK edition). The DVD is also notable for having a new commentary track featuring director Scott and star Crowe. The film is on the first disc, the second one has a three-hour documentary into the making of the film by DVD producer [[Charles de Lauzirika]], and the third disc contains supplements. Discs one and two of the three-disc extended edition were also repackaged and sold as a two-disc &quot;special edition&quot; in the EU in 2005.

==Possible sequel==
In June 2001, [[Douglas Wick]] said a ''Gladiator'' [[prequel]] was in development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stax2001&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author=Stax|title=IGN FilmForce Exclusive: David Franzoni in Negotiations for Another Gladiator!|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 16, 2001|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/300/300625p1.html|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Wick, [[Walter Parkes]], [[David Franzoni]], and [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] switched direction to a sequel set fifteen years later;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian2002&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author=Brian Linder|title=A Hero Will Rise...

However, [[Russell Crowe]] was interested in resurrecting Maximus, and further researched Roman beliefs about the afterlife to accomplish this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stax2002&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author=Stax|title=A Hero Will Rise&amp;nbsp;– From the Dead!|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 17, 2002|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/380/380501p1.html|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ridley Scott]] expressed interest, although he admitted the project would have to be retitled as it had little to do with gladiators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stax2003&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author=Stax|title=Ridley Talks Gladiator 2|work=[[IGN]]|date=September 11, 2003|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/437/437722p1.html|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] contained on disc 2 of the extended edition / special edition DVD releases includes a discussion of possible scenarios for a follow-up. This includes a suggestion by [[Walter Parkes|Walter F. Parkes]] that, in order to enable Russell Crowe to return to play Maximus, who dies at the end of the original movie, a sequel could involve a &quot;multi-generational drama about Maximus and the Aureleans and this chapter of Rome&quot;, similar in concept to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''.

In 2006, Scott stated he and Crowe approached [[Nick Cave]] to rewrite the film, but their ideas conflicted with DreamWorks's idea of a spin-off involving Lucius, whom Scott revealed would turn out to be Maximus's son with Lucilla. Scott noted that a tale of corruption in Rome was too complex, whereas ''Gladiator'' worked due to its simple drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1646784/ridley_lays_quotgladiator_2quot_to_rest/| title=Ridley Lays &quot;Gladiator 2&quot; to Rest - Rotten Tomatoes| newspaper=Rottentomatoes| date=May 8, 2006 | author= Scott Weinberg | accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, details of Cave's ultimately-rejected script surfaced on the internet: the script having Maximus being reincarnated by the Roman gods and returned to Rome to defend Christians against persecution; then transported to other important periods in history, including [[World War II]], the [[Vietnam War]], and finally being a general in the modern-day [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. This script for a sequel, however, was rejected as being too far-fetched, and not in keeping with the spirit and theme of the original film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaels2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/06/nick-cave-rejected-gladiator-script | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Nick Cave's rejected Gladiator 2 script uncovered! | first=Sean | last=Michaels | date=May 6, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cave&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last=Cave | first=Nick| title = Gladiator 2 Draft | url=http://www.mypdfscripts.com/unproduced/gladiator-2-by-nick-cave | accessdate = 16 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March of 2017, Scott again stated that he has an idea of how a sequel could be done, and that he is currently trying to convince Russell Crowe to reprise his role as Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/10/ridley-scott-gladiator-sequel/?preview_id=5594789|title=Ridley Scott On 'Gladiator' Sequel: 'I Know How to Bring Him Back'|date=11 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Glass House: The Good Mother''''' is a 2006 [[direct-to-video]] film starring [[Angie Harmon]], [[Jordan Hinson]], [[Joel Gretsch]] and [[Bobby Coleman]]. Although it shares no characters with the 2001 film ''[[The Glass House (2001 film)|The Glass House]]'', it was marketed as a thematic sequel.

== Plot ==
The film tells the story of Abby ([[Jordan Hinson]]) and Ethan Snow ([[Bobby Coleman]]), who lose their parents in a tragic accident and are adopted by Eve ([[Angie Harmon]]) and Raymond Goode ([[Joel Gretsch]]), two seemingly-ideal parents who have recently lost a child of their own, David.

At first things seem good, but the first oddity manifests when Ethan gets his own room with a bathroom close to the master bedroom but Abby is given a bedroom far away, up in the tower of the house. From here, Abby notices a lot of strange things; there's a bed in the basement with David's name into it and many places they can't go into, like David's old bedroom. They are not allowed to make phone calls either. Eve and Abby get in to a fight at the dinner table, and Eve slaps Abby. Later on, Eve asks Abby to wash dishes. As Abby is washing them, she cuts her arm on broken glass that Eve purposely left in the sink for her. Abby did not see the glasses, since the sink was filled to the top with water, and covered in soap. Abby demands to be taken to the hospital, but Eve refuses and brings out a box of medical supplies. Raymond reveals that Eve was a nurse, and Eve makes the process as painful as she possibly can- including a shot, and stitches without any anesthetic or numbing medications. Later, Abby is seen sleeping, and Eve injects her with an unknown substance. Abby awakes, too late to do anything, except ask what the liquid is, Eve responds with &quot;This is for pain,&quot; Abby replies, that she's not in pain, but Eve states &quot;You will be.&quot; Abby falls asleep, quickly, suggesting that it was a sedative of some sort. Later on, Abby wakes up, and Eve tells her that she's been in bed for three days.

Ethan soon becomes almost deathly ill, and Abby soon discovers that Eve is poisoning him, and that this has occurred to all the previous foster children who died in her care. Abby makes an attempt to escape, but Eve catches her and locks her in the attic. Their parents' friend, Ben Koch ([[Jason London]]), comes over to the house to take the kids to Six Flags, but Raymond tells him that Eve took them to an art gallery. After a walk through the house Ben finds it very odd. Abby escapes through a window, then Eve comes after her. During this time the phone rings and Eve and Abby both race to answer it. Eve gets to it first, but the person on the other line hangs up. It is revealed that it was Ben, seeing if they really were gone.

After Abby tries to get away in the car again, she is stopped by Raymond, who Abby knocks out with a wrench. Ben arrives and enters the house, but is ambushed by Eve and drugged. Eve continues to chase Abby before luring her out of hiding via feigning talking to Ethan and catching her. She holds Abby over the railing, but Abby fights back and kicks Eve down the stairs. Eve takes a blow to the head at the bottom, appearing to be dead. Abby races to find Ethan, who she finds in a bathtub almost drowned to death. Abby pulls him out and Eve is standing behind her with a cleaver. She knocks Abby to the ground as Ben enters, and raises the cleaver. A shot is fired and Eve is killed, but it was not Ben who fired. It is revealed that Raymond fired the gun that killed his wife, having snapped out of his blind obedience caused by love. Raymond is arrested, and Abby and Ethan are taken to the hospital. The two presumably end up with Ben.

'''Glen Edward Rogers''' (born July 15, 1962), also known as &quot;The Cross Country Killer&quot; or &quot;The Casanova Killer&quot;, is an American [[serial killer]]. He was convicted of two [[murder]]s and is a suspect in numerous others throughout the United States, including being mentioned, and considered by investigators in Los Angeles County, as a possible alternative suspect to [[O.J. Simpson]] in the murders of [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] and [[Ronald Goldman]],&lt;ref&gt;Cable News Network ''Documentary: Serial killer, not O.J., killed Simpson and Goldman'' 21 November 2012; by Alan Duke http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/20/justice/o-j-simpson-film-claim/&lt;/ref&gt; although as of 2017 nothing has developed regarding these allegations. Rogers was featured on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list after a crime spree that began on September 28, 1995 with Rogers first authoritatively established murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes&quot;&gt;Killer Found Guilty in 2nd Murder Case - Los Angeles Times.

== Early life ==
Rogers was born and raised in Hamilton, Ohio. He was one of seven children born to Edna (née Sears) and Claude Rogers. Claude was a pump operator at the local Champion paper company. Rogers was expelled from his junior high school before he was 16. Sometime after his expulsion, Rogers' 14-year-old girlfriend, Deborah Ann Nix got pregnant from another male. The young couple married soon after then had another child in 1981. In 1983, Nix filed for divorce alleging brutal physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-12/news/mn-2373_1_glen-rogers/2]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murders ==
Authorities suspected Rogers in the stabbing or strangling of an elderly man from Ohio in 1993 and four women in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Florida]] and [[Louisiana]]. He originally claimed the number of murders was closer to 70, but then recanted his statement, claiming he was joking and had not committed any murders.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers Says Claim of 70 Slayings Was in Jest : Crime: Suspect in cross-country killings tells media that his remark about victims was a joke and that he has never killed anyone. - Los Angeles Times.

:On January 10, 1994, Police recovered the remains of 71-year-old Mark Peters, a retired electrician and veteran, in a cabin belonging to the family of Glen Rogers in [[Beattyville, Kentucky|Beattyville]], [[Kentucky]]. Peters had taken Glen Rogers in and allowed him to live in his home prior to October 1993 when Mark Peters was reported missing along with his car and several valuable personal items including antiques, guns, and a collection of coins. Rogers had disappeared as well and it was reportedly his brother, Clay, who led police to search the family cabin for clues, leading to the discovery of Peters' skeleton, which was found bound to a chair and covered by a pile of furniture.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes-archives&quot; &gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-21/local/me-5758_1_serial-killer-postponed | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Leslie | last=Berger | title=Extradition Hearing for Accused Serial Killer Postponed | date=November 21, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trutv.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/glen_rogers/3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

:On September 28, 1995, Sandra Gallagher, a 33-year-old mother of three, crossed paths with Rogers at McRed's bar, in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]], [[Los Angeles]]. The next day, Gallagher's strangled and badly burned corpse was found in her car near Rogers' Van Nuys apartment. Authorities allege that after murdering Gallagher, Rogers moved on to Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida, killing a woman in each state.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes&quot; /&gt; On June 22, 1999, Rogers was convicted of murdering Gallagher&lt;ref name=articles.latimes /&gt; and on July 16, 1999 the state of California sentenced him to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serial Killer Rogers Sentenced to Death|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/17/local/me-56835|publisher=latimes | first=Kurt|last=Streeter|date=July 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Linda Price (Jackson, Mississippi)'''
:Kathy Carroll, Price's sister, said Price had met Rogers at a tent where beers were being served at the Mississippi State Fair. She remembered that her sister would repeatedly say, &quot;Ain't he good-looking?&quot; Rogers and Price briefly shared an apartment in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]. The last time Carroll saw her sister was the night before [[Halloween]] 1995, when the two were planning to have Carroll's grandchildren go trick-or-treating at Price's apartment. However, the next day, Price did not answer her door and Rogers was gone. Similar to the other killings, Price and Rogers met over drinks; and, like the other women, Price was in her 30s and had red hair. Like Cribbs, she was also found dead in a bathtub.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes&quot; /&gt;
* '''Tina Marie Cribbs (Tampa, Florida)'''
:On November 5, 1995, Cribbs was seen leaving the Showtown Barn in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], Florida, with Rogers. A bartender told police that Rogers had bought Cribbs and her friends drinks and that Cribbs was later asked for a ride by Rogers. Two days later, a member of the cleaning staff in a Tampa motel found Cribbs' body; she had been stabbed in the chest and the buttocks.  A clerk at the motel told authorities that Rogers had arrived at the motel a few days before the murder. On November 5, Rogers paid for an extra night and asked that his room not be cleaned. The clerk then saw Rogers putting his belongings into a white [[Ford Festiva]]. The next day, Cribbs' wallet was discovered at a rest area in North Florida; the fingerprints lifted from her wallet and the motel room were matched to Rogers. On November 13, Rogers was arrested in Kentucky driving Cribbs's car, which he claimed had been lent to him. He also said Cribbs was alive when he left. On July 11, 1997, Rogers was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Tina Marie Cribbs.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERS, GLEN E « Profiles on Florida’s Death Row. (n.d.). Profiles on Florida’s Death Row.

== Sentence and appeals ==
Rogers was scheduled to be put to death on [[Valentine's Day]], 1999, in Florida, but he immediately appealed to the [[Florida Supreme Court]] claiming that the State had not presented enough evidence to support the charges. Rogers also argued that the trial court should have granted the defense's motions for a mistrial because a witness was allowed to testify about a misdemeanor for which Rogers was convicted in California; he also claimed the prosecution was also allowed to present an improper argument during closing arguments. His appeal was delayed until March, 2001, and was ultimately denied. In April 2005, Rogers filed another appeal, which is still pending. Should his [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] ever be overturned based on a charge of prosecutorial misconduct, he will no longer be eligible for execution in the State of California.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv&quot;&gt;Ramsland, K.

==Motive==
Valance claimed he had a grievance with Strang.   Valance once worked for Strang but was sacked because Strang accused him of theft. Strang had legal proceeding against Valance accusing him of theft while Valance claimed Strang had owed him the money and it was Strang's fault he had his car repossessed.

==Crime==
In the early hours of 16 June 1964, Glen Valance tied up three station hands at the Koonroon property near [[Bordertown, South Australia]] then entered the bedroom of Richard and Suzanne Strang. Valance shot and killed Richard Strang as he slept and then raped his wife. Valance escaped by car and drove towards Adelaide, Mrs Strang called Police and Valance was captured at a road block near [[Murray Bridge]]. The rifle was in the car with him.

==Trial and Sentence==
Valance pleaded insanity but was found guilty and sentenced to death by South Australian state Chief Justice Sir [[Mellis Napier]] on 17 September 1964. The [[Supreme Court of South Australia]] dismissed his appeal on 9 October and a further application to the [[High Court of Australia]] for leave to appeal was rejected on 9 November. The death sentence was carried out on 24 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portside-messenger.whereilive.com.au/news/story/killer%2Dwas%2Dabused/ |accessdate=16 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415201308/http://portside-messenger.whereilive.com.au/news/story/killer-was-abused/ |archivedate=15 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glen Stewart Godwin''' (born June 26, 1958) is an American [[fugitive]] and convicted murderer who was added to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list on December 7, 1996, nine years after he [[Prison escape|escaped]] from [[Folsom State Prison]] in [[Folsom, California]] where he was serving a 26-years-to-life sentence. He replaced O'Neil Vassell on the list. However, he was dropped from the list on May 19, 2016.

==Murder of Kim LeValley==

In 1980, Godwin was living in [[Palm Springs, California]], working as a self-employed tool salesman, a mechanic, and a construction worker, with no discernible criminal history. Godwin and his roommate, Frank Soto, Jr., planned to rob a drug dealer and pilot, Kim Robert LeValley, who was once a friend of theirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/topics/article/Palm+Springs/00fPc9rdSRb0R/4 |title=Former valley man on local, federal most wanted list |publisher=''The Desert Sun'' |location=Palm Springs, California |date=June 11, 2009 |format=Fee required |accessdate=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin and Soto lured LeValley back to their [[condominium]] where Soto held him, Godwin punched and kicked him, tried to strangle him,&lt;ref name=&quot;LeValley&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Sabrina |last=Brummond |url=http://www.pe.com/breakingnews/local/stories/PE.REPORTS.2005.01.03_lifer03.748d5b01.html |title=Drama, agony relived at parole hearings|publisher=''PE.com Southern California News'' |location=[[Riverside, California]] |date=January 6, 2005 |accessdate=December 25, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; then ultimately stabbed LeValley 26 times with his [[butcher knife]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hope&quot;/&gt; After the murder, Godwin and Soto loaded the body into a truck and set off for the desert. Godwin tried to blow up the evidence by using homemade explosives strapped to the body.

==Escape from Folsom State Prison==
In 1987, Godwin attempted to escape during his incarceration at [[Deuel Vocational Institute]] in California, and he was moved to [[Folsom State Prison]], a maximum-security prison. Authorities believe Godwin's wife Shelly Rose Godwin and his former cellmate in Deuel, Lorenz Karlic, helped to plan his escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foxnews&quot;/&gt;

A [[hacksaw]] and other tools had been smuggled into the prison for Godwin. On June 5, 1987, he cut a hole through fence wire and escaped into a [[storm drain]] that emptied into the [[American River]]. Godwin dropped through a manhole and crawled {{convert|750|ft}} through the pitch-black drain. An accomplice, suspected to be either Godwin's wife or Karlic,  had left a [[raft]] that Godwin used to float down the river, following painted arrows on rocks that directed him where to go.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foxnews&quot;/&gt;

In June 1987, Karlic was arrested in [[Hesperia, California]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Karlic&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/58324921.html?dids=58324921:58324921&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+09%2C+1987&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=Suspected+Helper+in+Prison+Escape+Seized&amp;pqatl=google |title=Suspected Helper in Prison Escape Seized |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |location=Los Angeles, California |date=June 9, 1987 |format=Fee required |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and convicted for aiding Godwin's escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Anderson |last=Cooper |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/30/acd.02.html |title=The Hunt for the FBI's &quot;Ten Most Wanted&quot; Fugitives |publisher=''[[CNN]]'' |location=[[New York City]] |date=January 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1988, Shelly Godwin was classified as a federal fugitive for her role in her husband's escape. She was captured by the [[FBI]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], on February 7, 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelly&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=24512&amp;refresh=1#case |title=Shelly Godwin Captured in Dallas |publisher=''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' |date=January 25, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and escape==
Godwin fled to Mexico, where he unsuccessfully participated in the [[illegal drug trade]]. He was arrested in [[Puerto Vallarta]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3D6F4738A1711&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Escaped Killer, Dealer, Joins 10 Most Wanted |publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |location=[[Dallas, Texas]] |date=December 8, 1996 |format=Fee required |accessdate=December 25, 2009 | first=From | last=Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; later convicted for drug trafficking in [[Guadalajara, Mexico]], and sentenced to seven years and six months&lt;ref name=&quot;fugitive&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&amp;p_theme=sb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0D9D1C971B81E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=One Fugitive from Folsom Still Loose|publisher=''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'' |location=[[Sacramento, California]] |date=April 3, 1992 |format=Fee required |accessdate=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Puente Grande prison in 1991. While American authorities were working on Godwin's [[extradition]] proceedings, he allegedly killed a member of a [[Mexican drug cartel]] in prison. The new murder allegation delayed his extradition, which gave Godwin more time to execute another escape, which occurred in September 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foxnews&quot;/&gt;

Godwin is currently believed to be involved in the illicit drug trade somewhere in Latin America, having possibly used aliases such as Dennis Harold McWilliams, Nigel Lopez and Miguel Carrera.&lt;ref name=&quot;wanted&quot;/&gt; He is considered to be armed and extremely dangerous, and an obvious flight risk. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to Godwin's capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foxnews&quot;/&gt;

He was removed from the Most Wanted List in May 2016 with the FBI director declaring that &quot;We think the payoff from the publicity has diminished over time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Don Babwin.

'''Glenford Baptist''' is a [[Belize]]an man who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death along with two other men under the doctrine of [[Common purpose|joint enterprise]] for a murder committed in July 2000. He is Belize's longest-serving [[Prisoner|death row inmate]].

In 2015, Baptist's death sentence was [[Appeal|overturned]] and reduced to 25 years in prison.

==Crime==
Baptist was one of three men sentenced to [[Hanging|death by hanging]] in November 2001 after they were convicted of murdering Azrin White, who was shot dead on the night of July 24, 2000.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2015-12-23/&gt;

Along with Oscar Mendez and Gilroy Wade Jr., Baptist was held in [[Belize Central Prison|Belize's Central Prison]] to await execution.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2015-12-23/&gt;

Mendez successfully appealed his sentence in June 2002, arguing that he had been wrongly identified by a witness. He was released from prison.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2015-12-23/&gt;

Wade was killed by another prisoner in 2007.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2015-12-23/&gt;

Baptist's case was taken up by the [[Death Penalty Project]], an organisation which offers free legal representation to prisoners who have been sentenced to death. In July 2015 his lawyer, Priscilla Banner, successfully challenged his death sentence, arguing that his constitutional rights had been breached due to the length of time he had spent on [[death row]], which had caused him to be subjected to inhumane treatment and punishment. She also argued that the automatic death sentence given to Baptist was a breach of his constitutional rights.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2015-12-23/&gt;

==Reversal==
In July 2015, Chief Justice [[Kenneth Benjamin (judge)|Kenneth Benjamin]] [[Appeal|overturned]] Baptist's death sentence and scheduled him to be re-sentenced later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=33055 |title=Longest Serving Death Row Prisoner Is Off Hangman’s List |publisher=7 News Belize |date=July 13, 2015 |accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2015, Baptist was sentenced to 25 years in prison, which would be backdated to the date of his original conviction, meaning that he had already served 14 years of his 25-year sentence.&lt;ref name=Guardian-2015-12-23&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.bz/all-politics/10597-death-row-inmate-glenford-baptist-has-sentence-changed- |title=Death row inmate Glenford Baptist has sentence changed |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher= |location=Belize |date=December 23, 2015 |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In the UK, the case was featured in a [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] documentary in early 2016, titled &quot;14 Years On Death Row: At Death's Door&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/14-years-on-death-row|title=14 Years On Death Row|work=Channel 5|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glennon Edward Engleman''' (1927–1999) was a [[St. Louis]] [[dentist]] who moonlighted as a [[hitman]], concocting and carrying out at least seven murders for profit over the course of 30 years. He was already serving two life sentences in a Missouri jail when he pleaded guilty to the murder of a man and his parents in a separate [[contract killing]]. Engleman was a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]; he once stated that his talent was to kill without remorse&lt;ref name=&quot;schmidt091017&quot;/&gt; and he enjoyed planning and carrying out killings and disposing of the remains, in order that it would net him financial rewards. Methods used to kill his victims included shooting, bludgeoning with a sledgehammer and car-bombing. Engleman died in prison of a diabetes-related condition in 1999. The exact number of his victims is unknown.

==Early life==
One of four children, Engleman graduated in dentistry at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], in 1954. He had been admitted under the [[GI Bill]], having previously served in the US Army Air Corps.

==Known victims==
1958: Engleman is suspected of the death of James Bullock, 27, clerk.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmidt091017&quot;/&gt; Shot near the St Louis Art Museum. Was married to Engleman’s ex-wife Edna Ruth, who upon Bullock’s death collected $64,000.

1963: Engleman is suspected in the murder of Eric Frey, a business associate of Engleman at Pacific Drag Strip, in which Frey and the Engleman were partners.  Struck him with a rock, pushed him down a well, and used dynamite to blow him up afterwards. He then divided the insurance proceeds with Frey's widow.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmidt091017&quot;/&gt;

1976: Peter J. Halm. Shot in Pacific, Missouri. His wife, Carmen Miranda Halm, a former dental assistant trainee who had worked for Engleman and known him since childhood, ordered the hit to collect a $60,000 policy of life insurance on Halm.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmidt091017&quot;/&gt;

1977: Arthur and Vernita Gusewelle at their farmhouse near Edwardsville, Illinois. Arthur shot; Vernita bashed to death. Murdered their son Ronald in East St Louis 17 months later so his widow Barbara could claim the millions in [[life insurance]] she had taken out on her husband, the sole heir to his parents' oil business. Engleman was not convicted of these three deaths, but confessed to them while in prison. Barbara Gusewelle Boyle subsequently sentenced to 50 years in prison for the murder of her husband. She was released from the Dwight Correctional Facility on October 10, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmidt091017&quot;/&gt;

1980: Sophie Marie Barrera, owner of south St Louis dental laboratory. Killed in car bomb explosion. Engleman owed her over $14,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmidt091017&quot;/&gt; Accused by her son, Frederick Barrera, of her murder.

==Family==
Engleman was married three times: first to Ruth Ball. a school teacher from Kansas whom he met while at Washington University-no children; his second wife was Eda Van Ness, a librarian at the main branch in downtown St. Louis. They met through her brother Fritz, a swimmer at Washington University-no children; his third wife was Ruth Jolly, a bank clerk, and patient who sought him out because of his notoriety, and with whom he had a son, David Engleman who later became an engineer.

==In media==
*[[Corbin Bernsen]] played a man who resembled Engleman in ''Appointment for a Killing'', a 1993 [[telemovie]] loosely based on the Susan Bakos book ''Appointment for Murder''.
*The story was told in the episode &quot;Deadly Dentist&quot; on the program ''[[The FBI Files]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;deadlydentist&quot;/&gt;
*The 1996 movie [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116075/ ''The Dentist''] was based on this story.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}
*In the 2014 TV Show [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802850/ ''Fargo''], hitman Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) is shown acting as a dentist in order to track down a bounty.

'''Glory''' is a fictional character in the [[television series]] ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' portrayed by [[Clare Kramer]]. Glory is a god from a hell dimension and was the [[Big Bad|main antagonist]] of the fifth season.

==Character biography==

===History===
Glorificus (also known as &quot;Glory&quot;) is a god from a hell dimension in which she ruled alongside two other deities. Her power and dominion were vast and continued to grow stronger and stronger, as did her lust for misery and destruction, and she quickly became the most powerful of the three hell gods. Afraid and fearful that Glorificus would grow too powerful and seize total control of the dimension for herself, the other two allied together and went to war against her. The hell gods barely defeated her, but despite their victory, she was too powerful to destroy, so they banished her into the earthly dimension, where her essence would be imprisoned in a human child named [[Ben (Buffyverse)|Ben]], created solely to &quot;contain&quot; her until he eventually died as a mortal, sealing her.

Glory was too powerful to be completely contained within the human vessel and when Ben reached his 20s, Glory began to gain control over Ben for short periods of time, taking the form of a vain, self-centered human female possessing superhuman strength, speed and invulnerability. Glory's strength was greater than that of any Slayer, vampire or demon on Earth, although her powers were greatly diminished compared with those she had in her true form. [[Dark magick]]s prevent humans from learning that Glory and Ben are one and the same; even when she transforms right in front of someone, they instantly forget what they saw. The spell does not affect supernatural creatures like vampires and demons. This becomes a recurring joke in the penultimate episode of Season Five, where Spike finds himself repeatedly having to explain that Ben and Glory are the same person, only for people to either to misunderstand him or to instantly forget. As Ben and Glory's personalities begin to merge more and more (see below), the magic weakens until, in the finale, the whole gang is able to see through it. This human form is Glory's only weakness; if the human vessel containing her is killed, then Glory perishes with him.

Glory's goal is to find the Key, a &quot;mystical energy nexus&quot; which is the only way for her to return to her original dimension. Unfortunately, using the Key will break down the barriers between all dimensions, causing all worlds to bleed into each other and allowing &quot;Hell to reign on Earth&quot;. The Key was safe, guarded by an ancient group of monks known as The Order of Dagon. When they discovered &quot;The Beast&quot; (Glory) was searching for the Key they chose to hide it. Using ancient magic they transformed the Key into a human girl and placed her under the protection of the Slayer [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]], altering the memories of the Slayer and anyone connected to her into believing the girl was Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]]. The Order of Dagon were eventually destroyed by Glory. The last monk of the order was taken prisoner and interrogated by Glory, and later rescued by Buffy. Before the monk died from his wounds he revealed to Glory (under torture) that the Key had been transformed, but not what the Key had become. The monk, after being rescued by Buffy, revealed to Buffy that Dawn was the Key, something she already suspected.

Glory was also opposed by a [[Military order (society)|military order]] known as the &quot;Knights of Byzantium&quot;, composed of knights and clerics. They swore to prevent Glory from using the Key, and they attempted to kill Dawn before Glory could find her. In the episode &quot;[[Spiral (Buffy episode)|Spiral]]&quot;, a large group of knights besiege Buffy and Dawn, but Glory arrives and slaughters nearly all of them, taking the Key with her.

===The Key===
The Key is an ancient power, an ancient green mystical energy that according to Glory &quot;is almost as old as she is&quot;. The Key needs to draw on powers from the dimension it's in before being used, which is why it can only be used at a certain time and certain place. Who or what created the Key or how is unknown, even its true purpose is never fully revealed. The Key seems to work by destroying the barriers that separate one dimension from another. The longer the Key is in use, the more the walls of reality begin to break down. When the Key is activated, a small portal opens and begins to grow, in which demons, creatures and entire dimensions begin immediately bleeding through. 

Buffy's first confrontation with Glory came shortly after discovering there was something not right about Dawn. Buffy tried to go up against Glory and failed miserably. Glory beat Buffy severely, destroying an entire building in the process. The only thing Buffy did manage to do was escape during a temper tantrum by Glory which caused the building to collapse, escaping with the last surviving monk who quickly revealed to her the truth about Dawn being the Key and Buffy as her protector.

===Sunnydale===

Although Glory enters early on in Season 5, the [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]] knows very little about her, only discovering her name from one of Glory's minions. Glory's god-like status, her extreme power level, her origins, the Key's true nature and history are not known until later episodes. Glory comes to [[Sunnydale]] looking for &quot;The Key&quot;, which will allow her to return to her own dimension. The Key would cause damage to all dimensions, including the dimension [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and her friends inhabit, though Glory seems to be unaware or unconcerned of this fact. Glory is not aware of what form the Key has taken, though she knows that Buffy, the Slayer, protects it. For her part, Buffy is not initially aware of the Key's nature either. It is eventually revealed that Buffy's &quot;new sister&quot;, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], is the Key, in human form.

She begins the quest to locate the Key, aided by a race of pale, black-eyed demons who are loyal to her almost to a fault, though she does not care for them and viciously abuses them, both verbally and physically, for even the slightest failures. Glory quickly establishes herself as one of Buffy's most dangerous and determined enemies. At one point, she confronts Buffy in her own home, openly threatening to kill Buffy's friends and family and force Buffy herself to watch her do so.

Due to Glory being a god in a human body, the human mind can not control such power and this gradually turns Glory insane. In order to maintain her sanity and power, Glory feeds off the mental energies of humans by a process that Buffy and her friends refer to as &quot;brain-sucking&quot;. She inserts her fingers into the victim's head, absorbing the energies that bind the victim's mind. The humans that she &quot;devours&quot; in this way become incoherent and mentally unstable; those affected are also able to see Dawn in her true form. Glory's arrival in Sunnydale is followed by an inexplicable increase in the number of mental patients. One of her unfortunate victims is [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]]'s girlfriend, [[Tara Maclay|Tara]], who later inadvertently betrays Dawn to Glory. The Scoobies try to run, but Glory still manages to kidnap Dawn shortly afterward. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ben-glory.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ben, the human shell of Glory.]] --&gt;

The Key can only be used at a certain time, and as that time draws near, the power that separates Glory from Ben dissolves. They still inhabit Ben's body separately, but their memories and personalities begin to blur together.

After recovering from a mental breakdown caused by Glory's kidnapping of Dawn, Buffy decides to attack Glory with everything she has: Willow's magic spell to restore Tara's sanity stolen by Glory, at the same time weakening Glory's mind; the Dagon Sphere (a weapon created by the monks that causes physical pain to Glory); Buffy's robot double (the &quot;[[Buffybot]]&quot;) originally Spike's sex toy; Olaf, The Troll God's Hammer (with which Buffy is able beat Glory in battle and severely weaken her albeit temporarily, due to the hammer being a weapon of the gods); and eventually a [[wrecking ball]], commandeered by [[Xander Harris|Xander]]. Meanwhile, Spike, [[Rupert Giles|Giles]], and [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] attack her minions. The final spell that opens the rift between dimensions had already been started by one of Glory's disciples - [[Doc (Buffyverse)|Doc]] - by cutting Dawn with a knife and making her bleed (the act of which opens a portal to the other dimensions). After killing Doc, Buffy realizes that because the monks created Dawn from her essence, they share the same blood which means not only Dawn's blood but her own can close the portal, but it would also require her to die (her blood must stop flowing for the gateway to close). After saying goodbye to her sister, Buffy jumps into the portal that is opening, instantly dying and closing the gateway.

Glory is left defeated and significantly weakened, losing her hold on this reality and returning to the form and mind of Ben. Giles knows that Glory will eventually regain her power and return to get her revenge on Buffy unless Ben is killed, so he smothers Ben to death with his bare hands. As Ben dies, so does Glory.

Glory is also referred to as &quot;Glorificus&quot; by her minions and in most textual references, and occasionally as &quot;The Beast&quot; by the monks who created Dawn (although she has nothing to do with [[Beast (Buffyverse)|The Beast]] who appeared in ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', the spin-off series of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'').

After Glory's defeat, her final appearance in the series is at the end of the episode &quot;[[Lessons (Buffy episode)|Lessons]]&quot;, as an avatar of [[First Evil|the First Evil]] along with most of the other major villains from the series.

==Name==
&quot;That Which Cannot Be Named&quot; came into existence [[Prehistory|before written word]], and therefore (as its title implies) has no name. When the hell-god came to this dimension, she was dubbed &quot;Glorificus&quot; or sometimes &quot;Glorifius,&quot; names which she shortened to &quot;Glory.&quot; She was also known as &quot;the Glorious One&quot; (among many other amusing, groveling titles such as &quot;Her Splendiferousness,&quot; &quot;Her Sparkling Luminescence&quot; and &quot;Oh Sweaty-Naughty-Feelings-Causing One&quot;) by her demon minions, and as &quot;the Beast&quot; or &quot;the Abomination&quot; by the human priesthood and the [[Knights of Byzantium]]. The [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]] and Ben often refer to her by the insulting name of &quot;Hell-Bitch.&quot;

According to Jane Espenson, Glory was originally named Cherry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Powers and abilities==
In Season 5, Episode 13, &quot;Blood Ties,&quot; the gang begins discussing the Watcher Council's research on Glory. Buffy asks whether or not Glory, as a god, can summon elements like lightning. Giles responds, &quot;Normally, yes, but since she is in human form, her powers are severely limited.&quot; During season five the following were demonstrated:
* '''Near-invulnerability''': Only a Troll God's hammer was able to do any lasting damage to Glory when used repeatedly. In &quot;Tough Love,&quot; Willow's lightning bolts caused her pain, but caused no visible damage, though she comments that Willow's assault &quot;slowed her down&quot;. By the time of the season finale, Buffy mentions that Willow was the only one ever successful in actually hurting Glory up to that point. When a building collapses on top of her (see below), she was slowed down, but was unharmed. Similarly, she was unharmed after being hit by a truck. 
* '''Superhuman strength''': Glory possesses enormous [[physical strength]] far beyond that of most, if not all, vampires, demons, or Slayers; in fact, she is considered to be the most physically powerful [[Big Bad]] in the series, shown to be able to inflict massive damage on her opponents through pure brute force and physical strength alone. At one point, a building collapses on her after she repeatedly stomps her foot in a temper tantrum over a broken shoe. In &quot;[[Intervention (Buffy episode)|Intervention]]&quot;, she kicked Spike clear across her living room, through a solid wooden door, and to the other end of the room behind said door after losing her patience with him. In &quot;[[Tough Love (Buffy episode)|Tough Love]]&quot;, she squeezed Tara's hand to the point where it oozed blood, right before she fed off of her brain. In &quot;[[Spiral (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spiral]]&quot;, she punches a hole through the [[Force field (science fiction)|barrier]] that Willow had previously generated. Even Buffy, with her slayer strength, could barely stand toe-to-toe in a fight of brawl.
* '''Superhuman speed''': Glory's super-speed is depicted as a fast-moving blur that is apparently invisible to the naked eye. This is seen when she pursues Buffy and Dawn immediately after Tara, in her insane state, accidentally reveals that Dawn is the Key.
* '''Brain Sucking''': The ability to drain the mental energy of humans. This was primarily to maintain her own mental strength, but would also prevent Ben's form from resuming control. Not only does the drain draw out all energy leaving the victims in an insane state, they are also able to visually see the Key's true energy and ultimately become psychically linked to Glory and the Key.
* '''Shroud of Illusion''': A mystical shroud cast to prevent people from learning that she and Ben were the same person, the origins of which are unclear. It only works on humans; vampires, demons, and other non-humans are immune. She loses this capability in the penultimate episode of Season Five.
* '''Creature Identification''': The ability to differentiate between vampires and humans and also from any other creature from the Key, as seen in &quot;[[Intervention (Buffy episode)|Intervention]]&quot;, when her minions capture Spike under the mistaken impression that he is the Key. And also when they assume Tara is the Key and Glory quickly identifies she is not.
* '''[[List of comic book superpowers#Omni-linguism|Omnilingualism]]''': Able to speak and understand any human or demon language. This is known when humans and demons would talk to her in other languages and she would easily be able to interpret and understand.
* '''Magic''': In &quot;[[Shadow (Buffy episode)|Shadow]]&quot;, Glory cast an ancient spell that caused an ordinary snake to grow to a massive size and granted it the ability to see the true form of the Key, in addition to making it completely loyal to her. According to Giles, a spell such as that would need enormous levels of magic to perform, and Glory cast it easily.

The extent of Glory's true powers as a hell-god were never revealed or used, though according to Gregor in &quot;[[Spiral (Buffy episode)|Spiral]]&quot;, they were beyond what even her compatriot hell-gods could conceive. She later secures Ben's aid in recapturing Dawn by promising him immortality.

==Personality==
Clare Kramer says Glory's strength was her lack of self-doubt: &quot;She was completely secure in herself, focused on what she wanted and dedicated to her cause.&quot; Her strength was also [[hubris|her downfall]]; Kramer notes that Glory was unable &quot;to look at more than just herself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Doug Petrie, &quot;Joss very much wanted someone who was like the Joker to Batman. Someone who was just dynamic, charismatic and psychotic and we have all that. And Glory looks a lot better in a hot little red dress than the Joker ever did! We've got it all in Glory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Art links==
The picture in the living room of Glory's mansion is a copy of [[Tamara de Lempicka]]'s ''Irene and her sisters'' a.k.a. ''Four nudes''. The [[Poland|Polish]] art déco/futurist artist is renowned for being strongly [[feminism|feminist]] and openly [[bisexuality|bisexual]]/[[lesbianism|lesbian]].

In ''Buffy &amp; Angel: Official Yearbook'' 2006, Glory was voted number one by fans as &quot;Best Buffyverse Villain&quot;, followed by Angelus and the Mayor respectively.{{cn|date=December 2013}}&lt;!-- cite book --&gt;

==Appearances==

===Canonical appearances===
Glory appeared in 13 canonical episodes:

* Season 5: &quot;[[No Place Like Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|No Place Like Home]]&quot; (first appearance); &quot;[[Family (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Family]]&quot;; &quot;[[Shadow (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Shadow]]&quot;; &quot;[[Checkpoint (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Checkpoint]]&quot;; &quot;[[Blood Ties (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Blood Ties]]&quot;; &quot;[[I Was Made to Love You]]&quot;; &quot;[[Forever (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Forever]]&quot;; &quot;[[Intervention (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Intervention]]&quot;; &quot;[[Tough Love (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Tough Love]]&quot;; &quot;[[Spiral (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spiral]]; &quot;[[The Weight of the World (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Weight of the World]]&quot;; &quot;[[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Gift]]&quot; (killed)
* Season 7: &quot;[[Lessons (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Lessons]]&quot; (as an incarnation of The [[First Evil]])

==Merchandise==
The character's popularity prompted [[Diamond Comic Distributors|Diamond Select Toys]] to release two unique Glory action figures in 2006 and 2007: one figure is modeled on the character wearing her trademark red dress, and the other features the character dressed in black, as seen in &quot;[[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Gift]]&quot;. The latter action figure was released as part of a set, with the other figure being Dawn from the same episode.

A [[maquette]] of Glory was released as part of Electric Tiki's &quot;Tooned-Up Television&quot; line.&lt;ref&gt;Electric Tiki 'Buffy Tooned-Up', [http://www.electrictiki.com/tooned-up/buffy.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''God Bless America''''' is a 2011 American [[black comedy]] film that combines elements of [[political satire]] with [[black comedy|dark humor]]. The film is written and directed by [[Bobcat Goldthwait]], and stars [[Joel Murray]] and [[Tara Lynne Barr]].

==Plot==
Frank Murdoch ([[Joel Murray]]) is a middle-aged insurance salesman living in [[Syracuse, New York]], who is sick with how the United States has fallen into a state of rudeness based on [[Popular culture|pop culture]], [[talk radio]], television, and internet influences. After a boring evening of watching television, Frank visualizes killing his loud and inconsiderate neighbors, whose baby's screams exacerbate his chronic migraine headaches and rob him of sleep. His ex-wife Alison ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]) has custody of their daughter Ava ([[Mackenzie Brooke Smith]]), who has become a typical spoiled brat. Matters come to a head when he is fired after 11 years' service at the insurance company for obtaining a female co-worker's address without authority merely so as to innocently send her roses to lift her spirits; then told by his profane and disinterested doctor that he has an inoperable, terminal brain tumor.

Frank prepares to commit suicide but stops as his TV features a reality show starring Chloe ([[Maddie Hasson]]), an extremely spoiled teenager, and has an epiphany. The next day, he steals his noisy neighbor's car and drives to Chloe's school and, after unsuccessfully attempting to blow her up in her car, he shoots her at point-blank range. One of Chloe's classmates, Roxanne &quot;Roxy&quot; Harmon ([[Tara Lynne Barr]]), witnesses this and applauds him. Roxy follows Frank back to his motel where he is once again preparing to commit suicide; initially egging him on, Roxy then talks him out of it. Frank explains to Roxy that he only wants bad people to die – people who have committed blatant acts of cruelty and stupidity against their fellow man.  Roxy suggests they kill Chloe's parents and he agrees. Frank shoots Chloe's father ([[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]]), and after a brief chase, Roxy stabs her mother (Dorie Barton). Roxy convinces Frank to take her along by painting herself the tragic victim of her drug-addicted mother and rapist step-father. They then decide to go on the lam, continuing their killing spree. They visit a movie theatre to watch a documentary about the 1968 [[My Lai Massacre]]. During the film, several teenagers enter the nearly empty theatre and immediately act obnoxiously, talking aloud and on their cell phones. One of them throws popcorn at Frank. Frank and Roxy shoot and kill all but the least aggravating of them who Frank thanks for not being rude. Subsequently, they kill several others, including a rude man who double-parks his car, several extremist religious right protesters, and Michael Fuller ([[Regan Burns]]), a popular, abrasive [[Conservatism|conservative]] political television commentator.

During an evening while they're laying low, Roxy suggests to Frank that they move to France and 'go legit', to raise goats and make cheese, and avoid prosecution for the murders they've committed. 
Returning a phone message from his doctor, Frank learns there was a mix-up with his [[MRI]] results (the image was of another patient named Frank) and that he has no tumor and probably just suffers from any one of a number of relatively inconsequential ailments. Frank's new lease on life is spoiled when, while eating breakfast in the motel diner with Roxy and discussing their travel-to-France plans, a leering redneck at the next table labels Roxy an underage prostitute and Frank her pimp. The same day, Frank sees a TV news missing person report in which Roxy's parents (Andrea Harper and [[David Mendenhall]]) appear wholesome and concerned, a far cry from her description. Incensed at the deception, Frank takes out his anger on the leering diner, garroting him in his room. Frank takes the man's pickup truck and, as he is leaving, tells Roxy he knows the truth. She confesses but says she had to get away from a life of bland conformance and experience something 'un-normal'.  Frank leaves her the stolen car and they split up.

Frank buys an [[AK-47]] assault rifle from an illegal arms dealer (Mike Tristano) and makes his way to Los Angeles. Frank sees another TV news report that shows Roxy back home with her elated parents and that he is wanted for abducting her. Unbeknownst to him, Roxy is ''not'' happy to be back home. Frank goes to and gains access into the ''American Superstarz'' studio, kills several audience members and one judge, and holds the other judges, contestants, and the audience hostage. As the [[SWAT]] team arrives, Roxy also appears and joins Frank on stage, and she apologizes for lying to him. Frank makes a brutally honest speech in front of the TV camera about the ridiculousness and selfishness that is promoted in today's American society and on television. Frank then tells Roxy she is a pretty girl, and they proceed to shoot the judges, contestants and several members of the audience before they are gunned down by the police.

'''''God of War III''''' is a [[Third person (video games)|third-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed by [[SCE Santa Monica Studio|Santa Monica Studio]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] (SCE). Released for the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) console on March 16, 2010, the game is the fifth installment in the [[God of War (series)|''God of War'' series]], the seventh chronologically, and the sequel to 2007's ''[[God of War II]]''. Loosely based on [[Greek mythology]], the game is set in [[ancient Greece]] with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist and former God of War, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]], after his betrayal at the hands of his father [[Zeus]], King of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Gods]]. Reigniting the [[Titanomachy|Great War]], Kratos ascends [[Mount Olympus]] until he is abandoned by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. Guided by the spirit of [[Athena]], Kratos battles monsters, gods, and Titans in a search for [[Pandora]], without whom he cannot open [[Pandora's box|Pandora's Box]], defeat Zeus, and end the reign of the Olympian Gods.

The gameplay is similar to previous installments, focusing on [[Combo (video gaming)|combo-based]] combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses [[quick time event]]s, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features [[puzzle video game|puzzles]] and [[platform game|platforming]] elements. Compared with previous installments, ''God of War III'' offers a revamped magic system, more onscreen enemies, new camera angles, and [[downloadable content]].

''God of War III'' was critically acclaimed upon release, with a reviewer from [[IGN]] stating that it redefines the word &quot;scale&quot; in video games.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-PS3&quot; /&gt; It has been praised for its graphics, particularly of Kratos, which IGN called &quot;perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in video games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-PS3&quot; /&gt; The game received several awards, including &quot;Most Anticipated Game of 2010&quot; and &quot;Best PS3 Game&quot; at the 2009 and 2010 [[Spike Video Game Awards]], respectively, and the &quot;Artistic Achievement&quot; award at the 2011 [[7th British Academy Video Games Awards|British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) Video Game Awards. The best-selling game in the ''God of War'' series and the [[List of best-selling PlayStation 3 video games|sixth best-selling PlayStation 3 game of all time]], it sold nearly 5.2&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide by June 2012 and was included in the ''[[God of War Saga]]'' released for PlayStation 3 on August 28, 2012. In celebration of the ''God of War'' franchise's tenth anniversary, a remastered version of ''God of War III'', titled ''God of War III Remastered'', was released on the [[PlayStation 4]] on July 14, 2015.

==Gameplay==
{{further|Common gameplay elements in the God of War series}}
''God of War III'' is a [[Third person (video games)|third-person]], [[single-player video game|single-player]] video game. As with previous installments, the player controls the character [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed-camera]] perspective in [[Combo (video gaming)|combo-based combat]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/26/god-of-war-iii-features-first-person-kills/ |title=God of War III features 'first-person kills' |date=February 26, 2010 |last=Yoon |first=Andrew |publisher=[[AOL]] |work=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=April 9, 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6X6EF3yaM?url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/26/god-of-war-iii-features-first-person-kills/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The enemies are an assortment of creatures drawn from [[Greek mythology]], including [[centaur]]s, [[harpies]], [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]], [[cyclops|cyclopes]], [[satyr]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, [[cerberus]]es, and [[Gorgons]]. The player must also climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and swing on ropes to proceed through the game. The puzzles included vary in difficulty: some self-contained puzzles only require objects to be placed in a specific position, while some require timing and precision, such as a puzzle with mechanics similar to ''[[Guitar Hero]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|pp=6–7|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to finding Gorgon Eyes and [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] Feathers of the previous games, Minotaur Horns are a new item to be found. Where the eyes and feathers increase the player's [[Health (gaming)|heath]] and [[Magic point|magic]] meters, the horns increase the items meter, which allows further use of secondary weapons, called &quot;Items&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|p=10|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat===
[[File:GoW3 Kratos vs Hercules QTE.jpg|thumb|left|275px|alt=Screenshot of fight|Kratos (left) battles boss character [[Hercules]] (right). This is an example of a [[quick time event|QTE]] sequence found in all ''God of War'' games; moving the right [[analog stick]] as shown by the orange arrow will allow him to continue his attack.]]
Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Exile, replacing the Blades of [[Athena]] used in previous installments and the opening moments of this game. The weapon is a pair of blades that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of [[Hades]], the [[Nemean lion|Nemean]] Cestus, and the [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of [[onyx]].&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot;/&gt;

Unlike in previous games, magical abilities are learned with the acquisition of a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired:&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot;/&gt; the Bow of [[Apollo]], the Head of [[Helios]], and the Boots of [[Hermes]]. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios can be used as a lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.&lt;ref name=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|p=5|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relics [[Poseidon]]'s Trident, the [[Golden Fleece]], and [[Icarus]]' Wings acquired in previous games are retained and used to overcome environmental obstacles, with the Golden Fleece also used to deflect enemy attacks. Kratos acquires a new relic, Hades' Soul, which allows him to safely swim in the River [[Styx]]. The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in ''[[God of War II]]'', is used in this game with the special ability Rage of Sparta for temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt;

New additions to the gameplay include the combat grapple, a [[Ranged weapon|ranged-grab]] maneuver which, depending on the weapon, can pull Kratos towards foes or force them away—necessary at certain points in the game, with Kratos riding harpies across chasms—and a simple grab-with-bare-hands allowing him to use a weak foe as a [[battering ram]]. Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near defeated foes and providing additional abilities (e.g., unlimited magic) during [[New Game Plus|bonus play]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p10&quot;/&gt; The challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the game's completion. This mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks—for example, killing all enemies without using weapons before time runs out. The player may [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlock]] additional rewards, such as bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and [[concept art]] of the characters and environments, by completing the game's difficulty levels and the challenge mode. A new mode, the Combat Arena, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose opponents to hone playing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|p=11|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
As with previous games, ''God of War III'' is set in an alternate version of [[ancient Greece]] populated by [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Gods]], Titans, [[Greek Heroic Age|heroes]], and other characters from Greek mythology. The game is set across several locations on the fictional [[Mount Olympus]], including the Tomb of [[Ares]], the ancient city of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the Path of [[Eos]], the [[Labyrinth]], several areas of the Palace of the Gods, such as the Forum and [[Hera]]'s Gardens, and the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]] and [[Tartarus]].

The Tomb of Ares—housing the former God of War's remains—and the city of Olympia lie on the sides of Mount Olympus. Just beyond the city is the Path of Eos, a hidden cavern near the foot of Olympus. The Palace of the Gods is the home of the Olympians, and features the Forum (a small coliseum), Hera's Gardens, and the chambers of Aphrodite and Poseidon. The Labyrinth is a large aerial puzzle constructed by the architect [[Daedalus]] to imprison [[Pandora]] in the Caverns of Olympus, home of [[Scorpius#Mythology|Skorpius]] and its offspring. The Underworld, ruled by [[Hades]] and divided by the River Styx, is the realm of the dead. Hades' palace contains the remains of his wife, [[Persephone]], who was killed by Kratos in ''[[God of War: Chains of Olympus|Chains of Olympus]]''. The Underworld is also home to statues of the three Judges of the Underworld, who hold the Chain of Balance connecting the Underworld to Olympus. Tartarus is the prison of the dead where the Titan [[Cronus|Cronos]] was banished after Kratos retrieved Pandora's Box from Pandora's Temple (which is chained to the Titan's back) in ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]''.

===Characters===
{{main article|Characters of God of War}}
Kratos (voiced by [[Terrence C. Carson]]), a Spartan warrior and [[demigod]] who became the God of War after killing Ares and seeks revenge on Zeus for his betrayal, is the game's protagonist. Other characters include Greek gods such as Athena ([[Erin Torpey]]), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' mentor and ally; Zeus ([[Corey Burton]]), King of the Gods and the primary antagonist; Poseidon ([[Gideon Emery]]), God of the Sea; Hades ([[Clancy Brown]]), God of the Underworld; [[Hephaestus]] ([[Rip Torn]]), the [[Blacksmith|Smith God]]; Hermes ([[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]), Messenger of the Gods and the God of Speed and Commerce; Helios ([[Crispin Freeman]]), the Sun God; Hera ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]), Queen of the Gods who controls all plant life; and Aphrodite ([[April Stewart]]), Goddess of Love and Sexuality. Several Titans are featured, including [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] ([[Susan Blakeslee]]), Cronos (George Ball), [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]], [[Oceanus]], and [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]]. Other characters include [[Hercules]] ([[Kevin Sorbo]]), a [[demigod]] and  Kratos' half-brother; the architect Daedalus ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), father of Icarus; and Pandora ([[Natalie Lander]]), the created daughter of Hephaestus. Minor characters include the three Judges of the Underworld: King [[Minos]] ([[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]]), King [[Rhadamanthus]], and King [[Aeacus]]; [[Pirithous|Peirithous]] ([[Simon Templeman]]), an Underworld prisoner in love with Persephone, and Kratos' wife and daughter: Lysandra ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]) and Calliope ([[Debi Derryberry]]), who appear in a plot sequence in which Kratos journeys through his own psyche.&lt;ref name=&quot;characters&quot;/&gt;

===Plot===
Continuing immediately after ''God of War II'', Kratos, Gaia, and the other Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian Gods. Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood the world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him nothing more than a pawn for the Titans' revenge.

Kratos falls into the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; the souls of the Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had previously sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.

Kratos continues his ascent, murdering powerful foes that include the Titan Perses and the god Helios, which causes the sun to disappear, plunging the world into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. The Spartan chases the god, who leads him to the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and is key to the success of his quest, as it was in ''God of War''. Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos and is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She then leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a [[teleportation]] device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the [[Omphalos Stone]] so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims that he was trying to protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, the Spartan travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills the taunting goddess, ending all plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.

The imprisoned architect Daedalus tells Kratos to unite the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights his way through the aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound in her chest where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.

Athena reappears, demanding that Kratos return what she thinks he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils of the world in the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.

In a [[post-credits scene]], a trail of blood leads away from an abandoned Blade of Olympus, with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.

==Development==

In a 2007 interview with [[GameTrailers]], ''God of War'' creator and game director [[David Jaffe]] explained his original intention for the series, which is different from the actual ending of ''God of War III'', which was based on game director Stig Asmussen's vision. Jaffe's idea was that &quot;''God of War'' explains, or ultimately will explain, why there are no more Greek myths&quot;. He said that it would  have been &quot;hell on earth&quot; as the gods and Titans battled each other for domination. Other mythological pantheons would have become involved after Kratos killed Zeus and the other Greek gods, and the result would be that humankind no longer believed in the gods—according to Jaffe, the only way a god can truly die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/sdcc-10-gttv-extended/702452 |title=SDCC 10: David Jaffe Interview |date=August 2, 2010 |publisher=[[Viacom]] |work=[[GameTrailers]] |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ce1AsmPb?url=http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/mmw93t/gt-tv-sdcc-10--david-jaffe-interview |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''God of War III'' was first mentioned by ''God of War II'' game director [[Cory Barlog]] at a ''God of War II'' launch event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3164206 |title=Cory Barlog Leaving SCEA |last=Leone |first=Matt |date=November 6, 2007 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] |work=[[1UP.com|1UP]] |accessdate=January 31, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ce1FJdrI?url=http://www.1up.com/news/cory-barlog-leaving-scea |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlog said that the game would have full [[1080p]] HD resolution (changed to [[720p]] in final release&lt;ref name=&quot;Playstation.Blog - Jeff Rubenstein - Social Media Manager, Sony Computer Entertainment America&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/01/18/god-of-war-iii-info-drought-ends-now/#comment-314113 |title=''God of War III'' Info Drought Ends Now |date=January 18, 2010 |last=Rubenstein |first=Jeff |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |accessdate=January 18, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6X6EjgYFY?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/01/18/god-of-war-iii-info-drought-ends-now/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and support [[Sixaxis]] tilt and vibration functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/godofwariii/video/6211094 |title=GameSpot Video: ''God of War III'' Stage Demo |last=Pham |first=Bryan |date=June 2, 2009 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 11, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ce1IjvFt?url=http://www.gamespot.com/god-of-war-iii/videos/god-of-war-iii-stage-demo-6211094/ |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced before the [[DualShock 3]] controller was introduced, this caused confusion since the Sixaxis controller does not support rumble.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooperative mode&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/God-of-War-3-on-PS3-confirmed,-with-rumble--a942-p0.php |title=''God of War 3'' on PS3 confirmed, with rumble? |last=Pinter |first=Justin |date=March 13, 2007 |publisher=[[PlayStation Universe]] |accessdate=January 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101925/http://www.psu.com/a942/God-of-War-3-on-PS3-confirmed,-with-rumble?page=0 |archivedate=February 19, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2009 [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC), the creative team said that the Sixaxis tilt capability had been removed because they &quot;could not find a suitable situation to use Sixaxis in the game effectively&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/13/joystiq-interview-god-of-war-3s-stig-asmussen-game-director/ |title=Joystiq interview: ''God of War 3'' director Stig Asmussen |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |date=February 13, 2009 |publisher=[[AOL]] |work=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ce2D9K7F?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/13/joystiq-interview-god-of-war-3s-stig-asmussen-game-director/ |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first eight months of development, game director Cory Barlog left Santa Monica for unexplained reasons and Stig Asmussen (lead environment artist and art director on ''God of War'' and ''God of War II'', respectively) became director. In an interview with [[IGN]], Asmussen said that Barlog &quot;had a major impact on the game&quot; and although he had left the team, they spoke several times afterwards and &quot;bounced a few ideas off him,&quot; but there was no formal collaboration. He also said that David Jaffe &quot;[had] been around the studio a few times&quot; and they &quot;[had] gone over some high-level stuff with him to get his observations and feedback.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/105/1052951p1.html |title=''God of War III'' Q&amp;A |date=December 8, 2009 |last=Roper |first=Chris |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=December 15, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ce2DwrLk?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/12/08/god-of-war-iii-qa |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in development when Barlog was still with the team, he expressed interest in a [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode &quot;if we can do something unique with it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooperative mode&quot;/&gt; In November 2009, Asmussen told ''[[GamePro]]'' that although a multiplayer option had been discussed, it was unsuitable for ''God of War III'': &quot;There's a story we want to tell and an experience we want to deliver, and multi-player doesn't fit into that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GamePro interview&quot; /&gt; By December 2009, the game was in its final developmental stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN interview&quot; /&gt;

In December 2008, Sony reported that ''God of War III'' would be the last game in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3171882 |title=Sony Claims ''God of War 3'' is Last in the Franchise |last=Stallock |first=Kyle |date=December 16, 2008 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]] |work=[[1up.com|1UP]] |accessdate=January 31, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Ce2GXCmZ?url=http://www.1up.com/news/sony-claims-god-war-3 |archivedate=December 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2010 John Hight told [[Joystiq]]: &quot;While ''God of War III'' will conclude the trilogy, it won't spell the end of the franchise&amp;nbsp;...

===Technical===

Asmussen said that one of the greatest challenges in developing ''God of War III'' for the PlayStation 3 was the &quot;complexity of everything&quot;; individual tasks, such as designing Helios' decapitation, could take a year because the &quot;level of detail [that was] expected [was] so high and intricate, it [crossed] multiple departments.&quot; He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;GamePro interview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN interview&quot; /&gt; The character model for Kratos in the [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) games used about 5,000 [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]; the PS3 model was about 20,000 – a high number, but less than that used by other models such as [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] in ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'', who used 35,000. Ken Feldman, the art director, commented that the polygon count was not the only factor, and cited the increased texture detail as one of the reasons for Kratos's realistic appearance. The developers used a new technique called blended normal [[Texture mapping|mapping]] to add realism to the basic model and hugely enhance the range of animation available (e.g., muscle movement, including visible veins, and facial animations). All of the main protagonists were animated by hand because the animators produced more effective work than basic motion capture, though the voice actors' facial movements were recorded by [[Image Metrics]]'s performance capture system. For animating things like hair, the animators created a secondary animation code, known as [[Dynamic simulation|Dynamic Simulation]], which allows the PS3 itself to mathematically calculate the way it should look; it accurately generates motion that previously took the animators long hours to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-making-of-god-of-war-iii |title=The Making of God of War III |date=March 27, 2010 |last=Leadbetter |first=Richard |publisher=Eurogamer Network |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=January 27, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6X6Ew5mKV?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-making-of-god-of-war-iii |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine for ''God of War III'' was from the first two installments. Santa Monica senior producer Steve Caterson said that the development team ported [[Kinetica (game engine)|''God of War II''{{'}}s engine]] to the PlayStation 3 and were able to quickly play the game. Everything that Kratos could do in previous games, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which allowed the developers to immediately begin designing new content. As the game was being developed, the code department would swap out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components. They replaced the renderer, the particle system, and the collision system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132688/interview_the_shape_of_god_of_war_.php?print=1 |title=Interview: The Shape of God of War III |last=Graft |first=Kris |publisher=[[UBM TechWeb]] |work=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212449/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132688/interview_the_shape_of_god_of_war_.php?print=1 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman said that although they were re-using the engine from ''God of War II'', the core engine for ''God of War III'' was brand new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/13/joystiq-interview-god-of-war-3s-ken-feldman-art-director/ |title=Joystiq interview: God of War 3's Ken Feldman, art director |date=February 13, 2009 |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |publisher=[[AOL]] |work=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=March 17, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6X6F86FBA?url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/13/joystiq-interview-god-of-war-3s-ken-feldman-art-director/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 2009 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) and the time the game shipped, [[Spatial anti-aliasing|morphological anti-aliasing]] (MLAA) was added, which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said &quot;improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame-rate.&quot; MLAA is &quot;now a popular edge-detection process that can cost-effectively remove jagged edges from each frame&quot;, which helped Santa Monica free up the processing cycle and &quot;allowed them to add to the spectacle in other ways.&quot; Diamand also said that &quot;depth-of-field, motion blur, crepuscular 'god' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed&quot; during that same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-how-sony-santa-monica-mastered-the-ps3 |title=How Sony Santa Monica mastered PlayStation 3 |date=May 4, 2013 |last=Morgan |first=Thomas |publisher=Eurogamer Network |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=January 27, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6X6CH5qxB?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-how-sony-santa-monica-mastered-the-ps3 |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''God of War III'' was critically acclaimed, receiving aggregate scores of 92.84% from [[GameRankings]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GR-PS3&quot; /&gt; and 92 out of 100 from [[Metacritic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MC-PS3&quot;/&gt; who describe their score as &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores |title=How We Create the Metascore Magic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=October 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928225241/http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores |archivedate=September 28, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Sessler of ''[[X-Play]]'' said that the game &quot;finishes the trilogy on an exceptionally high note&quot;, and it &quot;blends all of its best attributes into a stellar experience.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Play&quot;/&gt; IGN's Chris Roper said that ''God of War III'' &quot;practically redefines&quot; scale in video games, singling out the size of the Titans as being &quot;larger than entire levels in other games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-PS3&quot; /&gt; Mike Jackson of ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine - UK|Official PlayStation Magazine UK]]'' called it the biggest ''God of War'' game yet; if it was the series' last game, &quot;''God of War III'' gives PlayStation's toughest hero the send-off he deserves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OPMUK&quot;/&gt;

Matt Leone of [[1UP.com|1UP]] said that the gameplay has &quot;variety&amp;nbsp;... You seemingly see, acquire, and participate in something new around every corner&quot;. According to Leone, each weapon &quot;adds a lot of depth to the combat system.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1UP&quot;/&gt; Christian Donlan of ''Eurogamer'' said that the &quot;combat system, level flow, and pacing of bosses and puzzles remains largely untouched. But everything's bigger, grander and more elaborate.&quot; He praised the weapons' accessibility, saying that it is easy to quickly switch between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;EuroG&quot;/&gt; According to Tom McShea of [[GameSpot]], the combat and scale &quot;have been pushed further than ever before&amp;nbsp;... creating an experience so focused and explosively fun that it's hard to put down, and even harder to forget.&quot; McShea said that regardless of repetition, &quot;the brutality of combat is one of the most satisfying aspects of ''God of War III''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSpot-PS3&quot; /&gt; Joe Juba of ''[[Game Informer]]'' called ''God of War III'' &quot;visceral&quot; and &quot;brutal&quot;, and Kratos &quot;the undisputed king of the genre.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Informer-PS3&quot;/&gt; Jackson, however, said the core gameplay's familiarity &quot;makes it feel less than the very, very best&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;OPMUK&quot;/&gt; and according to Roper, two of the three additional weapons are similar to the main blades; they &quot;have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large they're more of the same.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-PS3&quot; /&gt;

Its plot received mixed reviews. GameTrailers said that ''God of War III''{{'}}s storyline makes Greek mythology more interesting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gametrailers&quot;/&gt; [[GameFront]]'s Phil Hornshaw said it had an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefront.com/kratos-revels-in-cruelty-and-god-of-war-3-assumes-you-do-too/ |title=Kratos Revels in Cruelty, and ''God of War 3'' Assumes You Do Too |date=January 15, 2013 |last=Hornshaw |first=Phil |publisher=[[Break Media]] |work=[[GameFront]] |accessdate=July 26, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6X6FlBhVQ?url=http://www.gamefront.com/kratos-revels-in-cruelty-and-god-of-war-3-assumes-you-do-too/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Donlan, the story is as simple as it can get.&lt;ref name=&quot;EuroG&quot;/&gt; McShea said that although it does not pick up until near the end, it &quot;becomes powerful and moving in unexpected ways, peaking in a thrilling conclusion that successfully touches on many different emotions and provides closure for this epic tale.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSpot-PS3&quot; /&gt; Juba, on the other hand, considered that the plot &quot;doesn't have any standout revelations or developments&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Informer-PS3&quot;/&gt;

Jackson called ''God of War III''{{'}}s graphics as good as (if not better than) those in ''[[Killzone 2]]'' and ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPMUK&quot;/&gt; According to Juba, the &quot;cinematic camera work [is] even more impressive than Naughty Dog's feats with ''Uncharted 2''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Informer-PS3&quot;/&gt; Roper said, &quot;''God of War III'' presents some of the most impressive visuals that I've ever seen in a game. Kratos in particular looks phenomenal, and is perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in videogames.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-PS3&quot; /&gt; According to GameTrailers, &quot;the levels are expertly designed&quot; and the game's scale is the most outstanding visual achievement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gametrailers&quot;/&gt;

===''Remastered''===
Though the original release of ''God of War III'' was met with critical acclaim, ''God of War III Remastered'' only garnered generally favorable reviews, receiving aggregate scores of 80.37%&lt;ref name=&quot;GR-PS4&quot;/&gt; and 81 out of 100&lt;ref name=&quot;MC-PS4&quot;/&gt; from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Reviewers found it odd that Sony decided to remaster ''God of War III'' for PlayStation 4, as its story picks up immediately from the ending of ''God of War II'', which may confuse newcomers who have never played the previous games. Praise was given to the smoother textures and improved frame rate, though because the original already had impressive graphics, the changes were not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN-PS4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Informer-PS4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSpot-PS4&quot;/&gt;

'''''GoDai: Elemental Force''''' is [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game]], released by [[The 3DO Company]] on January 21, 2002.

==Gameplay==
''GoDai'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[action game]] with emphasis on [[melee]] combat. The game's environments are displayed through fixed camera angles.

The player controls a [[ninja]] named Hiro, who starts play unarmed but can collect a variety of Asian weapons throughout the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/324/324123p1.html| title = Godai Elemental Force| author = Fujita, Akira| publisher = [[IGN]]| date = 2002-02-07| accessdate = 2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include blades such as swords and knives, spears and axes; all of which can be used to execute combo attacks. Larger weapons such as [[polearms]] have a longer reach, allowing Hiro to attack enemies without getting too close. Two weapons that the player has previously collected can be taken into each subsequent mission, more appear throughout the missions themselves, allowing Hiro to increase the amount of weapons he is carrying. Ranged weapons including shurikens and smoke bombs, and several types of ranged magical attacks like fireballs, can also be employed in tandem with close-quarters weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/godaielementalforce/review.html |title=GoDai: Elemental Force Review |author=Lopez, Miguel |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=2002-01-26 |accessdate=2008-12-16 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiro possesses the ability to glide through the air by willpower alone, during which the player retains full control of Hiro's movement as he descends. The effect has been likened to [[wire-fu]] movies and takes the place of jumping in the game,&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespot&quot;/&gt; allowing the player to bypass combat and traverse the game world. Some enemies are able to use this ability too, and will pursue Hiro through the air. Hiro also has the ability to roll, a dodging move, which is accompanied by a ''[[Max Payne]]''-like [[bullet-time]] effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespot&quot;/&gt;

'''Sir Godfrey McCulloch, 2nd Baronet''' of Mertoun (c. 1640 – 26 March 1697) was a Scottish politician who was executed for [[murder]].

==Biography==
In 1678 McCulloch served as a [[Shire commissioner|Commissioner]] for [[Wigtownshire (Parliament of Scotland constituency)|Wigtownshire]] at the [[Convention of Estates]] (Scottish Parliament).

In 1684, he shot William Gordon in the leg, partly as a result of  a long-standing feud (rising from a land dispute) between his family and the Gordon family.  Gordon later died of the infection caused by the wound.  McCulloch was found guilty and sentenced to death.  Although he initially escaped to [[France]], he was captured when he returned to [[Edinburgh]] in 1697 and beheaded at the [[Mercat Cross]].  McCulloch had been living in Scotland since 1694 under the alias &quot;Mr. Johnstoune&quot;.  He was the last man to be executed on the [[Maiden (beheading)|Maiden]].  Following his death, much of his family emigrated to [[United States|America]], and [[Cardoness Castle]], which had been owned by the family since c. 1470, was abandoned.  

There is also a legend (quoted by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], a distant relation) that McCulloch was in fact saved from execution by a gnome whom he had done a favour for earlier in life, and that he was never seen again.  Another story tells that after his beheading, his headless body ran 100 yards down the [[Royal Mile]].  Given his sensational trial and the number of witnesses present, either story is unlikely at best.

'''''Gods of Egypt''''' is a 2016 [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Alex Proyas]] and featuring [[ancient Egyptian deities]]. It stars [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]], [[Brenton Thwaites]], [[Chadwick Boseman]], [[Élodie Yung]], [[Courtney Eaton]], [[Rufus Sewell]], [[Gerard Butler]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]]. The film portrays a mortal Egyptian hero who partners with the Egyptian god [[Horus]] to save the world from [[Set (mythology)|Set]] and rescue his love.&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.godsofegypt.movie/story | title=Gods of Egypt &amp;#124; Official Movie Site &amp;#124; Story | work=godsofegypt.movie | publisher=[[Lionsgate]] | accessdate=February 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming took place in Australia under the American studio [[Summit Entertainment]]. While the film's production budget was {{nowrap|$140 million,}} the parent company [[Lionsgate]]'s financial exposure was less than $10 million due to tax incentives and pre-sales. The Australian government provided a tax credit for 46% of the film's budget. When Lionsgate began promoting the film in November 2015, it [[#Racial and ethnic casting|received backlash]] for its predominantly [[Whitewashing in film|white cast playing Egyptian deities]]. In response, Lionsgate and director Proyas apologized for ethnically inaccurate casting.

Lionsgate released ''Gods of Egypt'' in theaters globally starting on {{nowrap|February 25}}, 2016 in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]], and in the United States, Canada, and 68 other markets on {{nowrap|February 26}}. The film was panned by critics, who criticized its choice of cast, script, acting and special effects. It grossed a total of $150 million against a $140 million budget.

==Plot==
In an alternate version of Egypt, the world is flat and gods live among humans. The [[Egyptian gods]] are distinguished from humans by their greater height, golden blood, and ability to transform into their animal-headed deity forms.

Bek, a thief with little faith in gods and their goodwill towards humans, with his love Zaya are attending the coronation of [[Horus]]: God of the Air. Horus is shown getting ready for his coronation as his love [[Hathor]] surprises him. Horus hints at marriage and they discuss Hathor's protection bracelet made of the stars which Horus gave to her to protect and save her from her previous role as a guide to dead souls in the underworld. During the ceremony, [[Osiris]] is killed by his extremely jealous brother [[Set (deity)|Set]]: God of the Desert who seizes the throne and declares a new regime where the dead will have to pay with riches to pass into the afterlife. Horus is stripped of his eyes, which are the source of his power, and almost killed. Hathor pleads with Set in surrender to spare him and he is instead exiled. Hathor becomes an enslaved mistress to Set.

A year later, Bek has been working as a slave building monuments while Zaya is now under the ownership of the chief architect Urshu. Believing that Horus is the only one who can defeat Set, she gives Bek the floor plans to Set's treasure vault. Bek is able to steal back one of Horus' eyes. However, Urshu finds out about their theft and kills Zaya as the couple flee. Bek takes her body to the blind Horus and makes a bargain: Horus agrees to bring Zaya back from the dead for his eye and Bek's knowledge about Set's pyramid.

Later, they are traveling to Ra's [[Solar deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|divine vessel]] above the Earth. Horus is unable to convince [[Ra]] to regrant him his power in full or to intervene and defeat Set himself as Ra is both neutral about their conflict and daily at war with an enormous shadow beast [[Apep|Apophis]], that threatens to devour the world. Nevertheless, Horus obtains divine waters from Ra's vessel which can be used at Set's pyramid to extinguish the desert thirst and weaken him gravely. Ra tells Horus that his weakness is the result of him not fulfilling his destiny, which Horus believes means avenging his parents' deaths.

Set asks Hathor to take him to the underworld which he next desires to conquer, but she refuses and manages to escape. Horus saves Bek when the Egyptian [[Minotaur]]s led by [[Mnevis]] arrive to reclaim Horus' eye for Set. Eventually, Hathor finds Bek and Horus. Horus at first doesn't trust her as she is a mistress of Set, who had blinded him, while she tries to convince him that Set is her enemy as well. When they tell her of their plan regarding Set's pyramid, she warns them of a guardian [[Sphinx#Egyptian sphinxes|sphinx]] who will kill anyone not wise enough to solve a riddle. The group then heads to the library of [[Thoth]]: God of Wisdom, recruiting him to solve the riddle.

Arriving at Set's shrine, they overcome its traps including the sphinx (Kenneth Ransom) to reach the source of Set's power. But before they can pour in the divine water, Set traps them and reveals Horus's deception to Bek: that he is unable to bring Zaya back from the dead. Set destroys their flask of divine water and kills Thoth by taking his brain. Horus is able to save Hathor and Bek.

Horus admits before the enraged Bek to caring more about his revenge than the mortals. Hathor feels guilt for not exposing the deception, and as the Goddess of Love, helps the doomed lovers. She sacrifices her own safety for Zaya's payment into the afterlife by giving Bek the protective bracelet which stops the underworld souls from overwhelming her and calling [[Anubis]] to take him to Zaya. Therefore, she lets herself be dragged to the underworld while Horus realizes that he still loves her.

Having obtained Thoth's brain, Osiris's heart, one of Horus's eyes, and wings from [[Nephthys]], Set has them combined with himself. Set travels to Ra, appealing to his father for approval and asking why Osiris was favored, while he was denied leadership and children. Ra claims that all of Set's prior mistreatments were tests preparing Set for his true role: the honor and burden of taking Ra's place as the defender of the world aboard his solar barge, fighting against the demon Apophis. Set is dismayed to hear his destiny is to be alone above the planet until he dies and refuses the offer. He wants to destroy the afterlife so that he can be immortal. Ra tries to fight Set by blasting him with his spear, though Set survives. Ra shows his surprise by saying &quot;No god could withstand that&quot;, to which Set replies &quot;I'm not just ONE god!&quot;, revealing to Ra that he stole the attributes of the other gods. Set then stabs Ra, taking his fiery spear of power, and casts him off the boat freeing Apophis to consume both the mortal and underworld realms.

Bek finds Zaya, who refuses Hathor's gift as she doesn't want an afterlife without Bek, but then Apophis attacks and the [[Book of Gates|gate to the afterlife]] is closed by Anubis. Bek returns to the mortal world, where Horus is amazed that Bek still wants to help take down Set. Bek tells him it was Zaya who told him to, as she still has faith in Horus.

Horus climbs up the outer wall of an obelisk Set is standing on and attempts to battle him, but is heavily outmatched. Bek ascends on the inside and joins the battle, removing Horus's stolen eye from Set's armor, being wounded in the process. As Bek slides toward the edge of the obelisk, he throws the eye toward Horus, who must choose to catch it or save Bek instead. Horus reaches for Bek and apologizes for all he has put him through. As they plummet toward the ground, Horus finds that he now has the power to transform into his divine form and he catches Bek and flies him to safety. Horus realizes that it wasn't the recovery of his eye nor revenge that was his destiny, it was the protection of his people that he needed to fight for. Now, Horus has the strength for battling Set, and he gains the obelisk and kills him. After the battle and Set's death, he then finds Ra wounded and floating in space, and returns his spear to him, allowing Ra to once again repel Apophis and for Anubis to reopen the gates.

As Horus returns to Bek, a child holds out his other eye which she has found, while people cheer him. But Horus's joy turns to sadness as he arrives to find Bek dying. Horus carries him to Osiris's tomb and lays him beside Zaya. Ra arrives and offers to bestow any power on him to repay Horus for his life and Egypt's survival. All Horus wants is bringing Bek and Zaya back to life. The other gods are also revived and have their attributes restored.

Horus is crowned king by Thoth and declares the afterlife will be for those who do good in the world. Bek is made [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|chief advisor]], and he gives Horus back Hathor's bracelet letting Horus leave to rescue her from the underworld.

}}
''Gods of Egypt'' is directed by [[Alex Proyas]] based on a screenplay by [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless]]. The film was produced under [[Summit Entertainment]]. Proyas was contracted by Summit in May 2012, to write the screenplay with Sazama and Sharpless, and to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sneider | first=Jeff | url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/proyas-in-talks-for-summit-s-gods-of-egypt-1118054227/ | title=Proyas in talks for Summit's 'Gods of Egypt' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 17, 2012 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proyas said he sought to make a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|big-budget]] film with an original premise, to contrast franchise films. The director cited the following films as influences on ''Gods of Egypt'': ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' (1975), ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and [[Sergio Leone]]'s Western films.&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20160203&quot; /&gt; [[Lionsgate]] anticipated for ''Gods of Egypt'' to be the first film in a new franchise after it finished releasing [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' films]].&lt;ref name=&quot;faughnder&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Faughnder | first=Ryan | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-movie-projector-gods-of-egypt-20160224-story.html | title=A roughly $15-million debut is predicted for 'Gods of Egypt' -- a $140-million film | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 24, 2016 | accessdate=February 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot in Australia. A crew of 200 began pre-production in [[Sydney]] in [[New South Wales]], and producers considered filming in [[Melbourne]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to take advantage of the state's tax incentive. [[Docklands Studios Melbourne]] was too booked to accommodate ''Gods of Egypt'', and producers were instead offered an airport facility for production.&lt;ref name=&quot;maddox&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Maddox | first=Gary | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/interstate-battle-for-gods-of-egypt-movie-decided-20140224-33bgl.html | title=Interstate battle for Gods of Egypt movie decided | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=February 24, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian states New South Wales and Victoria competed to be the location of the film's production, and Summit selected NSW in February 2014. The state's deputy premier, [[Andrew Stoner]], estimated that the production would add 400 jobs to the state and contribute {{nowrap|$75}} million to its economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;frater&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frater | first=Patrick | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/asia/summits-gods-of-egypt-heads-for-australia-shoot-1201119763/ | title=Summit's 'Gods of Egypt' Heads for Australia Shoot | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=February 24, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The union Media Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance filed an objection with Australia's [[Fair Work Commission]] stating that the film would adopt unfair work conditions.

In the film, the gods in humanoid form are {{convert|9|ft|m}} tall and in &quot;battle beast&quot; form are over {{convert|12|ft|m}} tall. Proyas used [[forced perspective]] and [[motion control photography]] to portray the difference in height between the actors portraying the gods and the humans. Proyas called the logistical challenge a &quot;reverse Hobbit&quot;, referring to ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films, in which Hobbits are depicted as shorter than humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20151215&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2015/12/15/the-gods-of-egypt-alex-proyas-grapples-with-a-size-issue-in-fantasy-adventure/ | title='The Gods of Egypt': Alex Proyas Grapples With a Size Issue In Fantasy Adventure | work=[[Forbes]] | date=December 15, 2015 | accessdate=January 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Sphinx]], actor Kenneth Ransom portrayed the giant creature via [[motion capture]]. For the god Thoth, who can appear as many copies, actor Chadwick Boseman was filmed hundreds of times from different angles. For a scene with many copies of Thoth, other actors took a day to film the scene, where Boseman filmed the scene for three days.&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20160210&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2016/02/10/gods-of-egypt-unleashes-its-own-golem-a-giant-sphinx-of-stone/ | title='Gods Of Egypt' Unleashes Its Own Golem, A Giant Sphinx Of Stone | work=[[Forbes]] | date=February 10, 2016 | accessdate=February 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Composer [[Marco Beltrami]], who scored Proyas's previous films ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' (2009) and ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' (2004), returned to score ''Gods of Egypt''.&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20151215&quot; /&gt;

==Racial and ethnic casting==
{{See also|Whitewashing in film}}
White actors make up most of the principal cast of ''Gods of Egypt''. When [[Lionsgate]] began marketing the film, the [[Associated Press]] said the distributor received backlash for ethnically inaccurate casting. Lionsgate and director Alex Proyas both issued apologies. The AP said, &quot;While some praised the preemptive [[mea culpa]]... others were more skeptical, concluding that it's simply meant to shut down any further backlash.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bahr&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bahr |first=Lindsey |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c7a2e028d4c246808f9422f264f6e074/gods-egypt-renews-concern-about-inaccurate-film-casting |title='Gods of Egypt' renews concern about inaccurate film casting |work=ap.org |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 14, 2015 |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6dnaUNIpo?url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c7a2e028d4c246808f9422f264f6e074/gods-egypt-renews-concern-about-inaccurate-film-casting |archivedate=December 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The casting practice of white actors as Egyptian characters was first reported after filming started in March 2014, when ''Daily Life''{{'}}s Ruby Hamad highlighted the practice as &quot;Hollywood whitewashing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hamad | first=Ruby | url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/news-and-views/dl-opinion/all-lead-actors-in-the-gods-of-egypt-will-be-white-20140401-35vzp.html | title=All lead actors in The Gods of Egypt will be white | work=Daily Life | publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] | date=April 1, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionsgate released a set of character posters in November 2015, and ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the casting received a backlash on [[Twitter]] over the predominantly white cast. Some suggested that the casting of black actor [[Chadwick Boseman]], who plays the god [[Thoth]], played into the [[Magical Negro]] stereotype. The previous year, the biblical epic ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' by director [[Ridley Scott]] received similar backlash for having a white cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;lee&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Lee | first=Benjamin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/gods-of-egypt-posters-anger-whitewashed-cast-twitter-exodus | title=Gods of Egypt posters spark anger with 'whitewashed' cast | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=November 13, 2015 | accessdate=November 13, 2015 }}

She said with the release of [[Aziz Ansari]]'s TV series ''[[Master of None]]'' in the previous week, &quot;Whitewashed casting and the offensiveness of brownface has pretty much dominated the pop culture conversation this week. Promotion for the movie is beginning just as we're wrapping a banner year for discussions of diversity and gender pay equity in the film industry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=McDonald | first=Soraya Nadia | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/11/12/gods-of-egypt-promo-posters-reveal-no-lessons-learned-from-exodus-fiasco/ | title='Gods of Egypt' promo posters reveal no lessons learned from ‘Exodus’ fiasco | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=November 12, 2015 | accessdate=November 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lionsgate followed its release of posters with a release of a theatrical trailer, Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' said, &quot;The implication remains that white actors, even generic white actors with zero box office draw, are preferable in terms of domestic and overseas box office than culturally-specific (minority) actors who actually look like the people they are supposed to be playing.&quot; He said almost none of the actors, aside from potentially Butler, qualified as box office draws.&lt;ref name=&quot;mendelson&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Mendelson | first=Scott | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/11/17/gods-of-egypt-gets-a-visually-spectacular-trailer/ | title='Gods Of Egypt,' With Gerald Butler And Chadwick Boseman, Gets A Visually Spectacular Trailer | work=[[Forbes]] | date=November 17, 2015 | accessdate=November 17, 2015 }}

In response to criticisms of its casting practice, director Alex Proyas and Lionsgate issued apologies in late November 2015 for not considering diversity; Lionsgate said it would strive to do better.

Boseman, who plays the god Thoth, commenting on the whitewashing, said he expected the backlash to happen when he saw the script.

In the month leading up to release, director Proyas said his film was fantasy and not intended to be history. He cited &quot;creative license and artistic freedom of expression&quot; to cast the actors he found to fit the roles. He said &quot;white-washing&quot; was a justified concern but for his fantasy film, &quot;To exclude any one race in service of a hypothetical theory of historical accuracy... would have been biased.&quot; Proyas said that films &quot;need more people of color and a greater cultural diversity&quot; but that ''Gods of Egypt'' &quot;is not the best one to soap-box issues of diversity with&quot;. He argued that the lack of English-speaking Egyptian actors, production practicalities, the studio's requirement for box office draws, and Australia having guidelines limiting &quot;imported&quot; actors were all factors in casting for the film. He concluded, &quot;I attempted to show racial diversity, black, white, Asian, as far as I was allowed, as far as I could, given the limitations I was given. It is obviously clear that for things to change, for casting in movies to become more diverse many forces must align. Not just the creative. To those who are offended by the decisions which were made I have already apologised. I respect their opinion, but I hope the context of the decisions is a little clearer based on my statements here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20160203&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2016/02/03/gods-of-egypt-silly-and-campy-or-an-unlikely-blockbuster/#3e3b28f349a4 | title='Gods Of Egypt'- Silly And Outdated, Or An Unlikely Blockbuster? | work=[[Forbes]] | date=February 3, 2016 | accessdate=February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the film was critically panned, Proyas said, &quot;I guess I have the knack of rubbing reviewers the wrong way.

==Release==

===Marketing===
[[Lionsgate]] spent an estimated {{nowrap|$30 million}} on marketing the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham&quot; /&gt; It released a set of character posters in November 2015, for which it received backlash due to white actors playing Egyptian characters, as noted above.&lt;ref name=&quot;lee&quot; /&gt; Later in the month, it released a theatrical trailer.&lt;ref name=&quot;mendelson&quot; /&gt; Lionsgate aired a 60-second spot for ''Gods of Egypt'' during the [[pre-game show]] of the [[Super Bowl 50]] on February 7, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hipes | first=Patrick | url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/gods-of-egypt-super-bowl-ad-plan-lionsgate-1201697030/ | title='Gods Of Egypt' Getting 60-Second Spot In Super Bowl Pre-Game Show | work=[[Deadline.com]] | date=February 5, 2016 | accessdate=February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they released the trailer online a day earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lincoln | first=Ross A. | url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/new-gods-of-egypt-trailer-alex-proyas-gerard-butler-1201697792/ | title=New 'Gods Of Egypt' Trailer: Lionsgate Unleashes Super Bowl Spot A Day Early | work=[[Deadline.com]] | date=February 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week before the film's release, Lions released the [[tie-in]] [[mobile game]] ''Gods of Egypt: Secrets of the Lost Kingdom'' on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hannley | first=Steve | url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/02/17/gods-of-egypt-movie-tie-in-game-gets-a-surprise-release/193462/ | title=Gods Of Egypt Movie Tie-In Game Gets a Surprise Release | work=Hardcore Gamer | date=February 17, 2016 | accessdate=February 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office forecast===
''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' forecast two months in advance that ''Gods of Egypt'' would gross {{nowrap|$14.5 million}} on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, and that it would gross {{nowrap|$34 million}} total on its theatrical run. The magazine said the film had &quot;a strong ensemble cast&quot; and that its director has &quot;had a noteworthy following&quot;. ''BoxOffice'' also said the premise could attract movie-goers who saw ''Clash of the Titans'', ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', and the ''[[Percy Jackson (film series)|Percy Jackson]]'' films. Admissions to 3D screenings would help boost ''Gods of Egypt''{{'}}s gross. The magazine said factors negatively affecting the film's gross were a &quot;lackluster reaction&quot; to its marketing and the backlash to its predominantly white cast causing negative buzz. It anticipated that the film's release would be front-loaded (focused on profiting mainly from opening weekend) due to the poor buzz, its categorization as a fantasy film, and with ''[[London Has Fallen]]'' opening the following weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Garris | first=Daniel | url=http://pro.boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2016-01-long-range-forecast-gods-of-egypt-triple-9 | title=Long Range Forecast: 'Gods Of Egypt' &amp; 'Triple 9' | work=[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]] | date=January 2, 2016 | accessdate=January 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week before the film's release, ''[[TheWrap]]''{{'s}} Todd Cunningham reported an updated forecast of {{nowrap|$15 million}} for its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Cunningham | first=Todd | url=http://www.thewrap.com/gods-of-egypt-on-track-for-15-million-opening-can-it-beat-the-odds-and-launch-a-franchise/ | title='Gods of Egypt' on Track for $15 Million Opening – Can It Beat the Odds and Launch a Franchise? | work=[[TheWrap]] | date=February 19, 2016 | accessdate=February 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Pamela McClintock said it was tracking to gross between {{nowrap|$12 million}} and {{nowrap|$15 million}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcclintock&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=McClintock | first=Pamela | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-deadpool-wont-have-869356 | title=Box-Office Preview: Big-Budget 'Gods of Egypt' Imperiled | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=February 24, 2016 | accessdate=February 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham said the expected gross was low for the film's triple-digit budget as well as additional marketing costs. He said the film could attract Alex Proyas's fan base but that it had suffered &quot;some negativity out there&quot; due to the predominantly white casting as well as the film being perceived to have an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; feel. Exhibitor Relations senior media analyst Jeff Bock said the film &quot;feels late&quot; years after the release of ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007) and ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'' (2011), and an earlier production and release would have been more advantageous. Cunningham said with Lionsgate's financial exposure only being {{nowrap|$10 million}} and the expected opening gross, the film could gross between {{nowrap|$40 million}} and {{nowrap|$50 million}} for its theatrical run in the United States and Canada and ultimately avoid a loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham&quot; /&gt; ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s McClintock said &quot;ancient epics&quot; in recent years had not performed well at the box office, citing the 2014 films ''[[Hercules (2014 film)|Hercules]]'', ''[[The Legend of Hercules]]'', and ''[[Pompeii (2014 film)|Pompeii]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcclintock&quot; /&gt;

Ryan Faughnder of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said in the week before the film's release that the expected opening weekend gross meant that Lionsgate's plans to make ''Gods of Egypt'' the first film in a new franchise were unlikely. Faughnder said the film would need to perform strongly in territories outside the United States and Canada for a sequel to be developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;faughnder&quot; /&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Brent Lang reported that analysts said the film would need to open to {{nowrap|$30 million}} or more in the United States to justify a sequel.&lt;ref name=&quot;lang&quot; /&gt;

===Theatrical run===
''Gods of Egypt'' grossed $31.2 million in the USA &amp; Canada, and $119.6 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $150.7 million against a budget of $140 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOM&quot;/&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Gods of Egypt'' was panned by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Gary|date=February 26, 2016|url=http://variety.com/2016/film/news/gods-of-egypt-box-office-flop-1201716160/|title=‘Gods of Egypt’ Heading for Epic Box Office Flop|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 16%, based on 166 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10.&lt;!--DONT ADD CONSENSUS; PER TALK PAGE, IT DOESN'T ADD VALUE TO SECTION--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gods_of_egypt/ |title= Gods of Egypt (2016) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gives the film a score of 25 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-of-egypt |title=Gods of Egypt reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alonso Duralde]] of [[TheWrap]] wrote, &quot;A mishmash of unconvincing visual effects and clumsy writing—not to mention another depiction of ancient Egypt in which the lead roles are almost all played by white folks—''Gods of Egypt'' might have merited a so-bad-it’s-good [[schadenfreude]] fanbase had it maintained the unintentional laughs of its first 10 minutes.

But this bloated enterprise is so tiresome by the end, it seems more likely headed for a long rest somewhere in the cinematic afterlife.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/post/gods-egypt-new-entry-pantheon-mythical-misfires/ |title='Gods of Egypt': A new entry in the Pantheon of Mythical misfires |website=Chicago Sun Times |accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]] of ''[[The A.V.

Jordan Hoffman of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said, &quot;This is ridiculous. This is offensive. This shouldn’t be, and I’m not going to say otherwise if you can’t bring yourself to buy a ticket for this movie.

In response to the reviews, director Proyas posted to [[Facebook]] calling critics &quot;diseased vultures pecking at the bones of a dying carcass&quot;, who were &quot;trying to peck to the rhythm of the consensus.

'''''Gods of Riverworld''''' (1983) is a [[science fiction]] novel, the fifth and last in the series of [[Riverworld]] books by [[Philip José Farmer]].  It was reprinted in 1998 by [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] under the title ''The Gods of Riverworld''.

This book concludes the chronicles of the adventures of such diverse characters as [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]], [[Alice Pleasance Liddell]], [[Aphra Behn]] and [[Tom Turpin]] through a bizarre afterlife in which every human ever to have lived is simultaneously resurrected along a single river valley that stretches over an entire planet.

Although Farmer's 1980 novel ''[[The Magic Labyrinth]]'' was originally intended to be the last in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=Philip Jose|title=The Magic Labyrinth|year=1980|publisher=Berkley-Putnam|location=Author's Foreword|isbn=0-425-04854-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer continued it in this novel, which picks up with the characters who have just arrived in the alien-built tower at the headwaters of the river from which this constructed world gets its name; they must decide how to use the resurrection machinery they now control, and also solve the mystery of the murder of the mysterious stranger.

'''Godwine Porthund''' was listed in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' as a butcher (&quot;carnifex&quot;) of [[Shrewsbury]] in 1006. [[Ælfhelm, Ealdorman of York]] had been invited to a feast with [[Eadric Streona]], who took him hunting in the forest where he was ambushed by Godwine Porthund and assassinated. Subsequently King [[Æthelred the Unready]] had the eyes of Ælfhelm's sons Wulfheah and Ufegeat gouged out at [[Cookham]].

{{nihongo|'''''Goemon'''''|五右衛門|Goemon}} is a 2009 Japanese [[historical fantasy]] film written and directed by [[Kazuaki Kiriya]]. It is loosely based on the story of [[Ishikawa Goemon]], a [[legend]]ary [[outlaw]] hero who stole valuables from the rich and gave them to the poor. The film is a [[fiction]]al account of Goemon's exploits and his role during the final phase of [[Sengoku period]], particularly the period leading up to the decisive [[Battle of Sekigahara]]. Like Kiriya's previous [[film]], ''[[Casshern (film)|Casshern]]'', ''Goemon'' was filmed on a [[digital backlot]], and made use of over 2,500 [[visual effects]].

''Goemon'' was released in North America on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] by [[Funimation]] on April 19, 2011, and features an English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] audio track.

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=March 2012}}
As a child, [[Ishikawa Goemon]]'s ([[Yōsuke Eguchi]]) entire family was [[assassination|assassinated]] for political reasons. His mother (Ryo) sent Goemon away for safety minutes before he witnessed her death. Running away with his caretaker, they were attacked by bandits but he was saved by the great [[Oda Nobunga|Nobunaga Oda]] (Hashinosuké Nakamura). Goemon followed Nobunaga and [[Hattori Hanzō]] ([[Susumu Terajima]]) was assigned to train him in the ways of the shinobi ([[ninja]]) along with his martial brother, [[Kirigakure Saizō|Saizō]] (Takao Osawa).

After many years of training, Goemon was assigned to protect Oda's niece, [[Princess]] [[Yodo-dono|Chacha]] ([[Ryōko Hirosue]]). They developed feelings for each other, but [[social status|status differences]] kept them apart and eventually she departed. Before leaving, Chacha gave Goemon her favourite fan as a [[Souvenir|memento]]. Oda rewarded Goemon's faithful protection of Chacha by giving him his double-bladed [[sword]]. Meanwhile, Oda's generals, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] ([[Eiji Okuda]]) and [[Akechi Mitsuhide]] ([[Kazuaki Kiriya]]), conspired to kill Nobunaga. The two made a secret written covenant, placing their signatures onto a black scroll. Mitsuhide, not trusting Hideyoshi, had his men hide the contract. After assassinating Nobunaga, Hideyoshi betrayed and killed Mitsuhide, took credit for slaying Nobunaga's killer and became the next ruler of Japan. With Nobunaga dead, the two young ninjas parted ways for different pursuits: Saizo hopes to be elevated to Samurai status and chose to remain in service to Nobunaga house, but Goemon chose to leave and be free. As a parting gift, Goemon broke his double-bladed sword in two and gave one-half to Saizo.

Years later, Goemon became a master thief and something of a [[Robin Hood]]. [[Sarutobi Sasuke]] ([[Gori (comedian)|Gori]]), an inexperienced [[bounty hunter]], tried to arrest Goemon, but failed and became his private servant instead. During a festival, Goemon infiltrated and robbed a treasure repository that contained a mysterious box with foreign writing on it. [[Ishida Mitsunari]] ([[Jun Kaname]]), a high-ranking samurai under Lord Hideyoshi, tried to retrieve this box to destroy it, but Goemon escaped with it, leaving behind only his calling card: a red sticker with the Japanese character &quot;Go&quot; on it. Goemon, unaware of the value of the box, threw it away and distributed the gold to the poor. A young pick-pocket, Koheita, picked up the mysterious box and kept it as a memento. The following day, Goemon learned of the box's value from Sasuke. Intrigued by the box, Goemon returned to the city to find it. Searching around the slums for the box, Goemon heard a scream and finds Koheita and his mother, who had just been callously murdered by cruel and petty local samurai. Goemon saved Koheita and retrieved the box, but also took Koheita under his wing.

Saizo and his ninja squad, working for Mitsunari, appeared and confronted Goemon. Refusing to turn over the box, Goemon fled and was pursued by Saizo's ninjas. Goemon evaded all of his pursuers except Saizo, who remained close behind him. In a showdown between the former brothers, Saizo informed him that the box Goemon carried was referred to as a &quot;Pandora's Box&quot; by foreigners, and the two engaged in a duel. After Goemon was overpowered and about to be killed by Saizo, Hattori Hanzo appeared and intervened, causing Saizo to withdraw. After returning to the city, Goemon examined the &quot;empty box&quot; and discovered a map to a mysterious treasure. Following the map, Goemon and Sasuke were led to the destroyed Buddha statue where Akechi Mitsuhide had hidden his contract with Hideyoshi. Goemon became angry once he learned that Hideyoshi was involved with Nobunaga's death. Hattori Hanzo then reappeared, under the command of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] ([[Masatō Ibu]]). Hanzo offered his old student a bag of gold for the contract, which Goemon readily agrees to. Seeking vengeance for his murdered lord, Goemon infiltrated Lord Hideyoshi's castle, where he killed Lord Hideyoshi and discovered Princess Chacha. Startled by another person entering, Goemon hid himself in the ceiling of Chacha's room, losing Chacha's fan as he did so. To Goemon's [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], the real Hideyoshi entered the room. Goemon had only killed his fake double. Suddenly, one of Lord Hideyoshi's guards discovered Goemon and shot him in the chest, blowing him out of the castle and into the moat. Later, Goemon was secretly rescued and recovered by Saizo.

Goemon was then contacted by Hanzo, who took him to a [[waterfall]] to meet Chacha. The princess had come to bid him farewell and returned the fan as she had reluctantly agreed to become Hideyoshi's concubine. Afterwards, Lord Tokugawa arrived to ask Goemon to assassinate Hideyoshi in order to save Chacha and the country. Elsewhere, Lord Mitsunari offered Saizo samurai status in return for killing Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon and Lord Tokugawa crafted a plan to assassinate Lord Hideyoshi during a celebration on his royal boat, but upon receiving his secret signal, Goemon changed his mind and did not complete the plan. Moments later, all of Lord Hideyoshi's escort ships were destroyed by explosives set by Saizo and his team; they captured Lord Hideyoshi and tried to assassinate him by hanging him from the ship's [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] with a steel chain. Lord Mitsunari, believing Lord Hideyoshi to be dead, then turned on Saizo and shot him. However, Lord Hideyoshi survived the assassination attempt and Saizo survived the gunshot wound. Lord Hideyoshi, unaware of [[Lord]] Mitsunari's [[betrayal]], [[interrogation|interrogated]] Saizo and threatened to kill Saizo's family unless he revealed who [[renting|hired]] him.

Meanwhile, Goemon tried to rescue Chacha, but because Lord Hideyoshi was still alive, she refused to leave. Later, against Sasuke's warnings, Goemon rescued Saizo from prison. Unfortunately, Lord Mitsunari killed Saizo's wife in reprisal and left a note on her body telling Saizo he had taken Saizo's child. Saizo was later recaptured and Lord Hideyoshi decreed Saizo should be boiled to death during an elaborate public execution. Hideyoshi told Saizo he would spare his child's life if he would reveal his name so he falsely identified himself as Goemon. Yelling in the huge crowd, Goemon tried to stop the execution but he could only watch in horror as Lord Hideyoshi kicked Saizo into the cauldron and then threw in the child. Sasuke, in shock over all of the carnage, blamed on Goemon and abandoned him.

With the help of Saizo's surviving team, Goemon stormed through the palace and eventually reached Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon wanted to know why Lord Hideyoshi had betrayed Lord Nobunaga. Hideyoshi explained it was his insatiable hunger for power that had driven him and Goemon eventually killed him. With Hideyoshi dead, there was a power vacuum that the strongest fought for. Tokugawa and Mitsunari raised their own armies to decide who would be the next ruler of Japan; but Goemon, tired of all the deaths and suffering, decided to intervene.

Goemon charged into the battle, wearing Lord Nobunaga's armor and carrying the repaired double-bladed sword. The armies were fearful and confused as they saw the crimson armor of Nobunaga. Goemon fought through the armies until he confronted and killed Mitsunari during a solar eclipse. Superstitious over the eclipse, Mitsunari's army fled in fear. Goemon then charged through Tokugawa's army, but Hattori Hanzo appeared and intercepted him mid-way. Goemon immobilized his former master by pinning Hanzo's foot to the ground with a broken sword blade. Approaching Tokugawa, Goemon closed the distance seemingly with apparent intent to kill, but was intercepted by Sasuke (who had joined Tokugawa's army). Mortally wounded by Sasuke, Goemon staggered and it was revealed that he was only holding Chacha's fan; instead of trying to kill Tokugawa, Goemon only planned to get him to promise that there would finally be peace and then leave. Goemon tries to make his way back to Chacha, but falls to the ground from his wounds. In his final moments, he admires the [[Firefly|fireflies]] and stars while Chacha cries, never to see Goemon again.

The film was nominated to the [[Asian Film Awards]] in 2010 in the categories Best Costume Designer (Vaughan Alexander and Tina Kalivas) and Best Visual Effects (Takuya Fujita and Kôji Nozaki).

According to [[Twitch Film]], &quot;''Goemon'' is going to be a divisive film ... It fits in well with their live action catalog of films like ''[[Shinobi: Heart Under Blade]]'' and yet it feels like a live action [[anime]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitchfilm.com/reviews/2011/04/blu-ray-review-goemon.php Reviews: Blu-ray Review: GOEMON]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[DVD Verdict]] review by [[Paul Pritchard]], ''Goemon'' &quot;entertains with its combination of imaginative visuals and exciting action sequences, but leaves you wanting for more&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/goemon.php DVD Verdict Review – Goemon]&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray Disc version was &quot;highly recommended&quot; by Blu-ray.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Goemon-Blu-ray/18219/#Review Goemon Blu-ray]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
The [[soundtrack]] to ''Goemon'', composed by Akihiko Matsumoto, was released in Japan on April 22, 2009, by [[Columbia Music Entertainment]]. The movie's theme song, &quot;Rosa -Movie Mix-&quot; by [[Violet UK]], was released on [[iTunes]] seven days later on April 29, 2009.

{{nihongo|'''''Ganbare Goemon'''''|がんばれゴエモン| |''&quot;Go for it, Goemon!&quot;''}}, known as '''''Goemon''''' and/or '''''Mystical Ninja''''' internationally, is a [[video game]] series created and produced by [[Konami]]. [[Etsunobu Ebisu]] is the joint producer of the franchise.

These games revolve around the main character, Goemon, and his exploits. As the name suggests, his character is loosely based on [[Ishikawa Goemon]], the noble thief of Japanese [[folklore]]. While the early games of this title emphasized Goemon as a noble thief, he eventually becomes more of a standard video game hero character. His trademarks are his blue bushy hair and weapon of choice, the [[kiseru]]. The games are set in a cartoon-like, mystical [[Feudal Japan]]. Within this world, every bit of folklore and legend about [[Japan]] is true. Although the series has its roots in action adventure, the ''Ganbare Goemon'' series has features from genres including [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[puzzle game]]s, and [[board game]]s. ''Ganbare Goemon'' has proven to be widely popular in Japan with its many video games, with its success spawning a wide series of merchandise and an [[anime]] and [[manga]] series.

Five of its games have been released overseas: ''[[The Legend of the Mystical Ninja]]'' for the [[Super NES]], ''[[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon]]'' and ''[[Goemon's Great Adventure]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] and two titles for the [[Game Boy]].

In 2002-2003, a mobile phone was released for the titled ''Ganbare Goemon: Tsūkai Game Apli'' series.

The last original game of the series was ''[[Ganbare Goemon: Tōkai Dōchū Ōedo Tengu ri Kaeshi no Maki]]'', released in Japan for the [[Nintendo DS]] in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]]. Since then, the series has been used primarily as themes for Konami's [[pachislot]] machines.

==Characters==

===Main===
These are the main principle characters of almost all the games. Yae and Sasuke joined the gang in later games but they are now full members of the gang.

;{{anchor|Goemon}}{{nihongo|*'''Goemon'''|ゴエモン}}: The main [[protagonist]] and titular character of the series, he is a hot-blooded man of [[Edo]]. With a strong sense of justice and will, he will right whatever wrong there is in front of him, although he has a short temper and tends to get upset rather easily. (Renamed &quot;Kid Ying&quot; in the North American release of ''Legend of the Mystical Ninja'' for the SNES. In the North American releases of ''Mystical Ninja: Starring Goemon and Goemon's Great Adventure'', his name is correctly translated to Goemon.) He primarily uses a variety of [[kiseru]] as his weapon of choice as well as throwing ''[[ryō]]'' and using a &quot;chain-kiseru&quot; in later games. Also in the future his descendant is referred to by the same name. His original voice actor was [[Shinichirō Ōta]], but this has since switched to [[Yasunori Matsumoto]]. He has his own Monster Card in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game and Yu-Gi-Oh OCG, known as Goe-Goe the Gallant Ninja.

;{{anchor|Ebisumaru}}{{nihongo|*'''Ebisumaru'''|エビス丸}}: Goemon's longest standing partner and best friend: a surprisingly pudgy ninja, with an equally puzzling eccentric personality. This character is based on Konami developer Etsunobu Ebisu. (Renamed &quot;Dr. Yang&quot; in the North American release of &quot;The Legend of the Mystical Ninja&quot; for the SNES. In the North American releases of ''Mystical Ninja: Starring Goemon'' and ''Goemon's Great Adventure'', his name is correctly translated to Ebisumaru.) He uses a different weapon in almost every game. His weapons are also quite unorthodox, being items such as flutes, party whistles, fans, frying pans, mallets, boxing gloves, hula hoops and a gymnastic ribbon. His special powers for some of the games are also peculiar, bordering on humorous, including spinning in a [[Tutu (clothing)|tutu]] to destroy blocks or his green poison gas attack (which might be a euphemistic reference to it actually being flatulence). Ebisumaru also has a daughter named Mao (she also makes a brief appearance at the end of ''Goemon's Great Adventure''). He also has a brother called Obisumaru who loathes him and a descendant from the future called Sister Bismaru (a nun). In the ending of the Famicom ''Ganbare Goemon 2'', it is revealed that Ebisumaru is in fact a girl, but this is not canon in any of the other games and not meant to be taken seriously. To further add to his bizarreness and the overall anachronistic elements of the games, he claims he's the descendant of American actor [[James Dean]], despite that claim being chronologically impossible. His voice actor is [[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]] in all voiced media and he speaks with an unusual [[Kansai dialect|Kansai]] accent. He also has a Yu-Gi-Oh card, named Masked Ninja Ebisu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pojo.com/yu-gi-oh/CardOfTheDay/2012/Feb/6.shtml |title=Pojo's Yu-Gi-Oh! Card of the Day |publisher=Pojo.com |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015061833/http://www.pojo.com/yu-gi-oh/CardOfTheDay/2012/Feb/6.shtml |archivedate=2013-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{anchor|Sasuke}}{{nihongo|*'''Sasuke'''|サスケ}}: A clockwork robot ninja. He was created by Monoshiri and often joins Goemon and Ebisumaru on their quests. A very naive and honest character, he sometimes fails to grasp jokes or irony. However, he also seems to have a switch that can make him from good to evil and vice versa. He is most famously known as the boss of the fifth stage in ''The Legend of the Mystical Ninja'' where he fought Goemon and Ebisumaru atop a giant ninja kite. Sasuke fights using all manner of weapons, including twin [[kunai]], miniature [[explosives]], and even his spiked topknot. He shows some signs of gender confusion, at one point in ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' asking why he cannot &quot;make a good wife someday&quot;, as well in the intro to ''Ganbare Goemon 4'' where is he dressed in female clothing. He is based on the fictional ninja [[Sarutobi Sasuke]]. His voice actor is [[Junko Hori]], and he speaks in very polite samurai speech, often punctuating his lines with &quot;de gozaru&quot;. He has his very own Monster Card in the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG and Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG, known as Sasuke Samurai. He also has three other series of Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster Cards, Sasuke Samurai #2, Sasuke Samurai #3 and Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke.

;{{anchor|Yae}}{{nihongo|*'''Yae'''|ヤエ}}: A [[kunoichi]] that works for the Secret Investigational Ninja, a secret organization of peacekeepers. She often joins Goemon and Ebisumaru on their adventures under the same goal. In battle, Yae usually wields a [[katana]], as well as her personal bazooka, and the ability to transform into a [[mermaid]]. She is depicted as level-headed and is the voice of reason compared to her comrades, who are either not so serious or too serious. Her voice actor is [[Rumi Kasahara]]. She also has her very own Monster Card in the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG and Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG, known as Lady Ninja Yae.

===Recurring===
These characters appear in most games. 
 
;{{anchor|Omitsu}}={{nihongo|*'''Omitsu'''|おみつ}}: The local belle of Edo who works at the local tea shop. She is basically Goemon's girlfriend, although he is scared of Omitsu due to her rather fiery temper and tendency to attack Goemon. She is also a constant target of foes. Omitsu also tends to get very jealous if Goemon is caught talking to another woman for any reason. According to the anime series, she is the granddaughter of Monoshiri and prepares [[ohagi]] that fuels Goemon's power to fight his enemies, though this was never needed for Goemon in the games.

;{{anchor|Monoshiri Ojiisan}}{{nihongo|*'''Monoshiri Ojisan'''|物知りお爺さん||lit. &quot;The Wise Old Man&quot;}}: A brilliant genius of clockwork machines who lives deep in [[Iga Province|Iga]]. Although a good fellow, he is also a big pervert. This trait was bowdlerized for the North American release of ''[[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon]]'', however: instead of collecting [[hentai]] magazines, he collects car magazines (the [[Anime Ganbare Goemon|''Mystical Ninja starring Goemon'' anime series]] however still depicts Monoshiri as a flirtatious girl-crazy old man). He is depicted as a very short man but wears high heeled wooden [[geta (footwear)|geta]] to make him appear taller.

;{{anchor|Goemon Impact}}{{nihongo|*'''Goemon Impact'''|ゴエモンインパクト}}: A giant clockwork robot made by Monoshiri Ojisan. With a frightful motif modeled after Goemon himself, it was built to help Goemon take on giant foes, but more often than not, he acts as a famous movie star in various parts of the world, and even has a planet named after himself. He shares Goemon's strong sense of justice, and enjoys fighting for the team. He also has a love of dancing, particularly disco.

*'''The Feudal Lord of Edo and Princess Yuki:''' The rulers of Edo. Despite this, they do little that inspires leadership. More often than not, they too are preyed on by evildoers and generally end up on the receiving end of very unfortunate accidents, even when they have relatively nothing to do with the current story's events. The lord and princess are described in the manual for ''Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon 2'': &quot;They are born to be at the wrong place, at the wrong time.&quot; Yuki has a significant role in ''[[Ganbare Goemon Pachisuro]]'', notably singing a song during gameplay.

===Others===
These characters appear only once or twice in specific games.

;{{anchor|Miss Impact}}{{nihongo|*'''Miss Impact'''|ミスインパクト}}: A female counterpart to Goemon Impact. Was created by the Wise Man as a counterpart to Goemon Impact, and is modeled after Omitsu. Omitsu refuses to notice the similarities... Goemon Impact fell in love with her at first sight and planned to ask her out. However, since Miss Impact has not been seen since &quot;Goemon's Great Adventure&quot; it is unknown how their relationship worked out.

;{{anchor|Suzaku}}{{nihongo|*'''Suzaku'''|スザク}}: A female ghost who comes from the Underworld. She made her first appearance in &quot;Goemon's Great Adventure&quot; and provides the gang with information about their enemy, Bismaru.

;{{anchor|Ebisu}}{{nihongo|*'''Ebisu'''|}}: She's the best friend to the Goemon in the future. She wields the same weapons as Ebisumaru and possibly is his descendant.

;{{anchor|Koryuuta}}{{nihongo|*''' Koryuuta'''|コリュウタ}}:

;{{anchor|Shogun Magginessu}}{{nihongo|*'''Shogun Magginessu'''|?}}: The main [[antagonist]]s in Ganbare Goemon 2: Kiteretsu Shogun Magginesu and Ganbare Goemon Pachisuro 2.

;{{anchor|Bisumaru}}{{nihongo|*'''Bisumaru'''|?}}: A descendant of Ebisumaru from the future who is a nun, hence her being called Sister Bisumaru. She tends to be infatuated with evil men and plots to take over the world so she can create a lovers' paradise for themselves.

;{{anchor|Space Clown Akogingu}}{{nihongo|*'''Space Clown Akogingu'''|?}}: The Main antagonist in Ganbare Goemon: Uchuu Kaizoku Akogingu.

;{{anchor|Kinemon}}{{nihongo|*'''Kinemon'''|?}}:

;{{anchor|Admiral Peruri}}{{nihongo|*'''Admiral Peruri'''|?}}:

;{{anchor|Dochuki}}{{nihongo|*'''Dochuki'''|?}}:

;{{anchor|Yui}}{{nihongo|*'''Yui'''|ユイ}}:

;{{anchor|Jurokubei}}{{nihongo|*'''Jurokubei'''|?}}: The main antagonists in Ganbare Goemon 3: Shichijuurokubei no Karakuri Manji Gatame.

;{{anchor|Baron}}{{nihongo|*'''Baron'''|?}}:

;{{anchor|Seppukumaru}}{{nihongo|*'''Seppukumaru'''|?}}: The main antagonists in Ganbare Goemon Kirakira Douchuu: Boku ga Dancer ni Natta Wake. Also appears in the anime series.

;{{anchor|Yoshitsune}}{{nihongo|*'''Yoshitsune'''|義経}}: The one of the main antagonists in Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei! and its remake, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou!.

{{nihongo|'''Goemon Ishikawa XIII'''|十三代目 石川 五ェ門|Jūsan-daime Ishikawa Goemon|lead=yes}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created by [[Monkey Punch]] for his [[manga]] series ''[[Lupin III]]'', which debuted in ''[[Weekly Manga Action]]'' on August 10, 1967. Goemon is a thirteenth generation descendant of the renegade [[samurai]] [[Ishikawa Goemon]]. He is famous for a reticent personality coupled by apparent unlimited skill in martial arts and swordsmanship with his sword {{nihongo4|Ryusei|流星|Ryūsei}}, known in the anime as {{nihongo4|Zantetsuken|斬鉄剣}}. A partner with [[Arsène Lupin III]] and [[Daisuke Jigen]], he tends to join their exploits only on a when-interested basis.

==Creation==
Goemon is unique to the series as he was the only character not there from the beginning. [[Monkey Punch]], in an interview featured on the American ''[[Rupan Sansei: Dead or Alive|Dead or Alive]]'' DVD release, mentioned he added Goemon later as he felt the manga needed a more Japanese character. As such, Goemon was primarily based on the character Kyūzō, the master swordsman of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1954 film ''[[Seven Samurai]]''. From the role came Goemon's strict demeanor and fast draw blade, as well as the long-faced appearance of actor [[Seiji Miyaguchi]].

==Description==
In the original manga, Goemon first appears as a very dangerous enemy of Lupin in chapter 28 {{nihongo4|&quot;Appearance of Goemon&quot;|五右ェ門登場|Goemon Tōjō}}. Lupin attempts to steal Goemon's master's [[alchemy|alchemic]] formula through infiltration of Goemon's clan, but his cover is blown by [[Fujiko Mine]], who is Goemon's girlfriend at the time. Goemon tries to kill Lupin over the next several installments, making attempts ranging from hiring assassins as skilled as [[Daisuke Jigen]] himself, to entering the service of three martial arts masters, to planting bombs in Lupin's belongings. However, he later decides that he could learn more working for Lupin than against him, and rather abruptly switches his allegiance. His position at Lupin's side is cemented when Lupin ruins the government's case against the man who killed Goemon's uncle, allowing Goemon to take his revenge as brutally and publicly as he wants without having to break into prison to do so.

By the events of the second manga series, Lupin trusts Goemon implicitly, and Goemon reciprocates. When a rival of Lupin's captures and hideously tortures Goemon, Goemon refuses to even respond to his interrogation, except to say that Lupin would find him and allow him to take revenge. Lupin then captures and seduces his rival's wife, and uses the information gleaned thereof to release Goemon, who slays his captor with Jigen's help.

In the original anime Goemon's relationship to Lupin starts off more professional than close friendship. By the [[Shin Lupin III|second anime series]], Goemon has developed a true loyalty to Lupin. However, he easily gets annoyed by Lupin's antics, especially Lupin's infatuation with women, Fujiko Mine in particular. He will occasionally oppose Lupin directly when Lupin's jobs or actions do not agree with his morals. He has even promised that the last act he will take with Lupin is delivering his deathblow. However, Goemon doesn't hesitate to help Lupin in serious situations, and readily assists him any time Lupin works for a just cause. However, in 1978's ''[[Mystery of Mamo|The Mystery of Mamo]]'', he claims that he helps Lupin simply so he can keep his vow to kill him himself.

Goemon has a much more amicable relationship with Jigen. Goemon sees Jigen as a fellow honorable warrior, while Jigen sees Goemon as a trustworthy &quot;foxhole buddy&quot;, and the two are frequently paired together during jobs, and usually help keep Lupin in check. On the odd occasion and increasingly in recent years, Goemon will ally himself with Fujiko, in spite of his distrust of her.

==Voice actors==
[[Image:goemon.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Goemon as seen in a TV special]]
Goemon Ishikawa was first voiced by [[Gorō Naya]] in the [[CinemaScope]] version of the 1969 [[Lupin the Third Part I#Pilot Film|pilot film for the first anime]], while [[Osamu Kobayashi (voice actor)|Osamu Kobayashi]] voiced him in the pilot's TV version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media |title=[[Lupin the Third Part I|Lupin the 3rd The Complete First TV Series]] (Disc 4) |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |people=Reed Nelson |medium=DVD |at=Origins and Ambitions: The Story of the Pilot Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Chikao Ōtsuka]] was given the role when the first anime was actually produced (1971-72).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media |title=Lupin the 3rd The Complete First TV Series (Disc 1) |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |people=Reed Nelson |medium=DVD |at=Episode 3 Commentary, 15:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goemon was taken over by [[Makio Inoue]] for [[Lupin the Third Part II|the second anime]] (1977-78), who continued to voice the character until 2010, with one exception. Due to budget concerns, [[TMS Entertainment|TMS]] decided not to employ the regular voice cast for the 1987 [[original video animation]] ''[[The Plot of the Fuma Clan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/So-Which-Lupin-the-Third-Anime-Should-You-Watch-Ne-4854.aspx |title=So, Which Lupin the Third Anime Should You Watch Next? |website=[[Otaku USA]] |publisher=Sovereign Media |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Goemon voiced by [[Kaneto Shiozawa]]. The 2011 TV special ''[[List of Lupin III television specials#ep22|Blood Seal - Eternal Mermaid]]'' marked the first appearance of [[Daisuke Namikawa]] as the character and he continues to voice Goemon Ishikawa to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-10-08/lupin-iii-supporting-voice-cast-changed-for-1st-time-in-16-years |title=Lupin III's Voice Cast Changed for 1st Time in 16 Years |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=October 8, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inoue did return to the role once more for the 2012 ''Lupin Family Lineup'' short original video animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-19/lupin-iii-master-file-bd/dvd-to-include-new-anime-short |title=Lupin III Master File BD/DVD to Include New Anime Short |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=January 19, 2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Ross voiced Goemon in the 1979 [[Toho]] English dub of ''[[The Mystery of Mamo]]'', where the character's name was changed to &quot;Samurai&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|work=[[The Mystery of Mamo]] | title=A History of Mamo in English |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Kramer (actor)|Steve Kramer]] (1992-3, [[Streamline Pictures|Streamline]]).

==Live Film Actor==
The 2012 film Lupin the Third featured TV and Film star [[Gô Ayano]] and the first live-action Goemon.  Goemon, who wears traditional Japanese robes (usually a fundoshi and hakama) in the manga and anime, was at one point considered to wear contemporary clothes in this film. Ryûhei Kitamura expressed that &quot;it would be nonsense for Goemon to exist in current society wearing samurai garb and carrying around a katana.&quot; In the completed film, however, Goemon wears robes similar to his drawn and animated counterparts.

==Reception==
In 2007, ''[[Oricon]]'' magazine polled readers on which characters they would most like to see in their own series.&lt;ref name = &quot;spinoff&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-01-08/oricon-fans-want-l-char-aznable-spinoffs | title = Oricon: Fans Want L, Char Aznable Spinoffs | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = 2007-01-08 | accessdate = 2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goemon appeared in the number eight position on the female readers polls, and seventh place in the combined poll.

The phrase &quot;'''Goffe and Whalley'''&quot; or &quot;'''Whalley and Goffe'''&quot; refers to two men who fled in 1660 to [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] after their involvement in the 1649 [[Regicide#The regicide of Charles I of England|regicide of King Charles I of England]]:

* [[William Goffe]], an English [[Roundhead]] politician and soldier
* [[Edward Whalley]], an [[English people|English]] military leader during the [[English Civil War]]

The phrase is occasionally used as [[metonym]] or [[synecdoche]] for the tribunal of men (also called ''[[wikt:regicide|regicides]]'') who ordered the king's execution.

Another regicide of Charles I who fled separately to [[New Haven Colony]], [[John Dixwell]], is sometimes included in the phrase (as in &quot;Goffe, Whalley, and Dixwell&quot;).

'''Gog''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s in the comics published by [[DC Comics]]. The first version first appeared in ''New Year's Evil: Gog'' #1, (February 1998), and was created by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Jerry Ordway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Gog | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 139 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===The Kingdom===
The first version of Gog was known as '''William''', the sole survivor of a nuclear disaster in Kansas that was caused by the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]'s shattering of [[Captain Atom]] during a battle with the [[Justice League]], and became a believer in [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|Superman]] as a savior, even creating a church dedicated to his philosophy as he tried to find meaning in the cataclysm that had taken place, believing that it was Superman's will that Earth be punished for forsaking him. One day, Superman visited him and told him that he wasn’t the omnipotent, perfect being that William thought he was, stating that Kansas happened simply because he wasn't there, shattering William's world view and mentally unbalancing him. When the Quintessence ([[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], [[Ganthet]], [[Zeus]], [[Highfather]], and the [[Phantom Stranger]]) invested him with a portion of their vast power, William, now known as Gog, went insane and blamed Superman for his misfortune, believing him to be the Anti-Christ who had allowed the Kansas disaster to take place to regain his standing in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

Using his newfound powers, Gog killed Superman. Unsatisfied by his victory, Gog traveled 24 hours back in time, found Superman, and killed him again, repeating the process over and over, going backwards one day further each time, and each time varying the means of Superman's death and absorbing portions of the slain Supermen's power. When he arrived on the day that Superman and [[Wonder Woman]]'s child was born, the entire Justice League tried to stop him, but they failed, and Gog took the child, deciding to go directly to the past where he intended to trigger the Kansas cataclysm almost twenty years early, burning Superman's insignia into the countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

Gog's actions exposed the existence of [[Hypertime (comics)|Hypertime]], a fictional construct similar to the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; Gog unknowingly passed into an alternate timeline each day he traveled back in time, effectively killing a different Superman at every turn. As a result, the Phantom Stranger was forced to recruit time traveler [[Rip Hunter]] of the [[Linear Men]], the only other person aware of Hypertime, in an attempt to preserve the secret, the other members of the Quintessence refusing to act to stop Gog for their own personal reasons.

Rip Hunter, refusing to believe the other Linear Men's claims that traveling back in time would destroy the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' reality, recruited Superman, [[Batman]], Wonder Woman, [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|Kid Flash III]] (daughter of [[Flash (comics)|Wally West]]), [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]] (son of [[Plastic Man]]), [[Nightstar (character)|Nightstar]] (daughter of [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]), and [[Ibn al Xu'ffasch]] (son of [[Batman]] and [[Talia al Ghul]]) from the ''Kingdom Come'' reality, along with the Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman from the present to fight Gog, luring him into [[Booster Gold|Booster Gold's]] &quot;Planet Krypton&quot; a superhero-themed restaurant that had been stocked with artifacts from various realities before Hunter moved the restaurant outside of time to limit civilian casualties. With the available arsenal, the heroes managed to wound Gog, with Batman using a [[Phantom Zone]] projector to partially send Gog into the Zone, severely scarring him while the heroes armed themselves. Gog fought back, knocking the heroes down as he himself collapsed in a weakened state. Unable to move from the force of the attack, the present Superman was convinced to fight back by the future Wonder Woman, who told him of the destruction of Kansas and how it happened as a result of him abandoning his fight for truth and justice following the death of [[Lois Lane]]. Refusing to allow those events to occur in his life, Superman charged at Gog, sending both of them and everyone else in the restaurant into Hypertime, thus allowing Hunter to preserve the ''Kingdom Come'' reality. Gog is then returned to the future by Rip Hunter and the future versions of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, who demand that the Quintessence restore him to the person he was.

===In the Name of Gog===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
A second version of Gog with a different origin appeared several years later in DC continuity. This version of Gog is a survivor of [[Imperiex]]’ attack on Topeka, Kansas. He was saved by Superman, but Superman was unable to rescue the boy's parents. Desperate to fix what had gone wrong, Gog grew up researching the science of time travel in an effort to go back in time and rescue his family.

Eventually, he succeeds in his efforts at creating a time machine, but his first prototype is unable to travel far enough back. He refines the time machine for over two-hundred thousand years, making it more and more powerful and using the technology to  give himself  super-powers. He then gives his research and advanced technology to younger versions of himself, which gives him more power due to rewriting history over and over. Realizing that he could not save his parents due to a temporal paradox (the death of his parents triggered the creation of his powers) his desire grows from saving his parents to punishing Superman for their deaths.

The present day Gog attacks Superman when [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] returns to Earth with newfound sentience and begins discovering emotions during his rampage. Doomsday arrives to see Superman on the verge of death after being beaten by an army of Gogs. Doomsday leaps to Superman’s defense just as Gog is about to kill him. Doomsday’s attempt to save Superman fails as Gog successfully kills him.

Over the next two-hundred years, Doomsday leads an army in Superman’s name against Gog. This future is erased when it is revealed that Gog didn’t actually kill Superman but has instead been keeping him prisoner and surrounded by Kryptonite.

Gog offers Superman the chance to go back in time and kill him. Superman eventually shows Gog the error of his ways when Doomsday bursts in and rescues Superman. Gog then offers Doomsday the chance to go back and erase this future at the cost of returning to his villainous ways which he agrees to. In the present, the present day Gog teleports away an unconscious Doomsday for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #825&lt;/ref&gt;

A third version of Gog recently appeared in the ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' ongoing series. In the new Multiverse, the events of the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' limited series take place on Earth-22. That world's version of Superman arrived on New Earth following the destruction of Earth-22. Gog appears soon after the other Superman’s arrival. Gog gruesomely slaughters [[metahuman]] criminals who claim to be gods by blasting holes through their chests and disintegrating their hearts. Some of his kills include the criminals Goth and Chroma and a group of beings calling themselves the New Olympians. The [[Infinity-Man]] and [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] were two who survived his onslaught. After facing off against the Infinity-Man, he attacks [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] who was spying on him, before taking on the Justice Society.

This version of Gog is a priest named William Matthews who received his powers from an underground citadel in Africa and took the name Gog, which was the name of the last surviving god of the Second World. He also claims that the Superman of Earth-22 let Kansas die, and is implied several times{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} to be a [[retcon|ret-conned]] version of the character appearing in &quot;In the Name of Gog&quot; story above, with his background changed due to the events of [[Infinite Crisis]]. When the Justice Society follow him back to the citadel, his body is absorbed by a stone face on a wall. The stone face rises, becoming a massive stone man adorned in gold who claims to be the one, true Gog.

This Gog, chronologically the first one, is an exile of the &quot;Second World&quot; who was unwilling to take sides in the final battle of the Old Gods and was cast off as a result. He then plunged into the [[Bleed (comics)|Bleed]] and traveled through various alternate universes until he landed on New Earth. Inert, his consciousness lingered in the stone and lava. A local tribe built a staff out of his remnants, enabling a user to channel Gog's energy. The staff was later found by William Matthews, who claimed the name Gog.

Upon being revived, Gog claims that Matthews wasn't his servant and that Matthews had been driven mad from visions of the Multiverse, including having visions of events on Earth-22.

This version of Gog displays a cheerful, childlike, peaceful personality. He claims he is &quot;happy to be alive&quot; and compelled to &quot;make things good again&quot;. He saves an African village near his citadel from the effects of toxic contamination from lava that contained his essence and heals [[Damage (comics)|Damage]]'s [[disfigurement|disfigured]] face in response to his skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #16&lt;/ref&gt; Gog then sends [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]] to a blissful, dream-filled sleep for twenty-four hours, cures [[Thom Kallor|Starman]] of his schizophrenia, gives [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Pieter Cross|Doctor Mid-Nite]] his sight back, and sends [[Power Girl]] &quot;[[Earth-Two|home]]&quot;. Gog then hears the noises of a war going on nearby and vows to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #17&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a small village under attack by a rogue militia, Gog transforms the soldiers into trees. During the conflict, [[Lance (DC Comics)|Lance]], one of the JSA's new recruits, is hit by a rocket launcher blast and killed. Gog brings Lance back to life, replacing his ruined arm with gold armor, and renames him &quot;[[Magog (comics)|Magog]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Gog's intentions to move on to the Middle East and punish the warmongers there in the same fashion as the militia members causes the Justice Society to split in half, with [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], Magog, Damage, [[Wildcat (comics)#Tom Bronson|Wildcat (Tom Bronson)]], [[Amazing Man (DC Comics)|Amazing Man]], [[Judomaster]], and [[Commander Steel#Nathan Heywood|Citizen Steel]] taking Gog's side.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19&lt;/ref&gt; Like the biblical [[God]], he asks for a rest on the seventh day, sending some of his followers back to America to preach his will. At the same time, the rest of the JSA who did not choose to follow Gog have started to realize that Gog's wishes have various negative side-effects; Starman fears that he cannot complete his mission in the past with his sanity intact, the loss of Sandman's prophetic dreams has cost him one of his greatest edges in hunting criminals, Doctor Mid-Nite feels hindered by the loss of his unique sight after so long with it, Power Girl finds that she has been sent to a 'new' Earth-Two with an existing counterpart for herself, and while Damage cannot see it, his restored face makes him increasingly vain and arrogant, dismissing his past to the point of burning down his father's home while constantly checking out his reflection in mirrors and believing that people only want to talk to him because he's so handsome.

After that, he collects them again, asking them gleefully to kneel down and worship him while he brings in a new world.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) ''The Kingdom'' one-shot&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the JSA arrive, having learned from Sandman that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will die if he ever leaves, leaving them with the one option of killing Gog and separating his head from the Earth. Hawkman and the rest of the Society following Gog attempt to protect him, until they see him attempt to transform [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] into lightning. All of Gog's followers turn against him and Gog punishes the Society by taking away his &quot;gifts&quot; to an extreme degree (Citizen Steel now feels pain in all his nerves and Starman can't be cured of his madness). Even Magog eventually turns on him, for which Gog's blessing on him is also undone.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the JSA are able to topple Gog and cut off his head. The Superman of Earth-22 and Starman take the still-living head to the [[Source Wall]], embedding it there for all eternity. Gog accuses Superman of being exactly what he accused Gog of being.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The first version of Gog used a cosmic staff&amp;nbsp;– imbued with the powers of the Quintessence&lt;ref&gt;The Quintessence is a group of gods and cosmic beings&amp;nbsp;– Zeus, Ganthet, Shazam, Highfather and the Stranger&amp;nbsp;– who embody most of the mystic power in the DC universe between them.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as his initial weapon and later used a trick he claimed to have learned from the [[Amazo]] of 2020 to absorb the powers of several alternate Supermen that he killed. His abilities included travelling through time at will, extremely keen senses, sufficient speed to intercept the Flash, superhuman strength considerably greater than Superman's and the prodigious intelligence needed to develop an almost infinite number of highly inventive and complicated ways to kill Superman.

The second Gog’s powers were based on science rather than cosmic or mystical power. This Gog also has the power to give other superhumans advanced abilities through the use of Kryptonite, such as imbuing [[Repo Man (comics)|Repo Man]] with enhanced strength and the ability to grow in size, in order to battle Superboy and a weakened Superman. He was also capable of flight, energy blasts, the creation, through time manipulation, of countless copies of himself and his spear, and teleportation throughout time and space.

The third version of Gog is actually a god from the ''Third World'', Urgrund, the world that once encompassed the two halves, [[New Genesis]] and [[Apokolips]], of the ''[[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]]''. As such he possesses a huge and boundless amount of cosmic powers. However, he chooses to use them in a reactive rather than proactive way, merely granting &quot;wishes&quot; to &quot;make people around him happy&quot;. Theoretically able to reshape reality at whim, he confines himself into granting people their innermost desires, often without bothering to consult with them first, this leading to potential mishaps; for example, he restored Doctor Mid-Nite's vision to normal, but this left Mid-Nite deprived of the enhanced vision he had grown used to when performing more delicate operations in the field, and took away Sand's nightmarish visions leaving Sand deprived of his key resource when conducting investigations. This Gog also displays a childlike and narrow minded personality, looking at the world with glee and awe, but he clearly understands what he is doing. He performed these miracles so that Earth's people would worship him in return for his gifts, punishing those who rejected him by turning enemy soldiers into trees, arguing that he wasn't technically killing them. When the JSA attacks him, he removed his blessings on all of them, even those who were still loyal to him at the time, purely out of spite, and even nearly managed to transform the Flash into lightning before Superman managed to deflect the blast.

==In other media==

===Figurine===
[[DC Direct]] released a cold-cast porcelain, hand-painted medium-sized statue of The Kingdom's version of Gog in 1998, based upon designs by artist [[Jerry Ordway]]. The statue was limited to 3,000 pieces only and measured at 7 7/8 x 5 x 5&amp;nbsp;inches, and included an official certificate of authenticity from DC Comics.

'''Gog''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]], the character first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #103.

==Fictional character biography==
While traveling through the [[Savage Land]], [[Kraven the Hunter]] finds a crashed space ship in [[quicksand]] and ventures inside. There, he finds the juvenile and minuscule Gog and another member of species, who had apparently died during the space ship crash landing. Deciding to save the young Gog from his sinking ship, Kraven takes him with him, names him Gog and decides to raise him as a pet; much to Kraven's surprise, Gog rapidly grows to gigantic size only days after being found by him.&lt;ref name = &quot;BeautyBrute&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic

Gog would later be saved from dying in the quicksand by the [[Plunderer]]. Having Gog (who created a device that allowed him to speak English) act as his servant, the Plunderer uses him in a plot to try to steal the super soldier serum in [[New York City]]. Followed to New York by Ka-Zar, Gog and the Plunderer battle him before Gog, using his teleportation bracelets, escapes, first to the [[Statue of Liberty]], then the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and finally, to another dimension.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

Gog is later found in the dimension he escaped to by [[Doctor Octopus]] and the [[Sinister Six]], who induct the creature into their group as the sixth and final member of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

Gog later appeared on [[Monster Isle]] when [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] appeared to look for a mutant girl named Bo. Gog was among the monsters that attacked the three until Magik teleported herself, Shadowcat, and Bo to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 3 #33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Gog possesses superhuman strength. He also wears bracelets that are capable of granting him interdimensional teleportation.

{{nihongo|'''''Golgo 13'''''|ゴルゴ13|Gorugo Sātīn}} is a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Takao Saito]], published in [[Shogakukan]]'s ''[[Big Comic]]'' magazine since October 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golgo 13 Start&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saito-pro.co.jp/golgo/index.htm|script-title=ja:ゴルゴ13（さいとう・プロ）|trans_title=Golgo 13 (Saito Production)|language=Japanese|publisher=Saito Production|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the manga won the 21st [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for general manga.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShogakukanAward&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html|title=の作品はオンラインで購入することができます。|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Shogakukan|language=Japanese|script-title=ja:小学館漫画賞: 歴代受賞者|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805112042/http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html|archive-date=5 August 2015|dead-url=yes|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series follows the title character, a professional assassin for hire.

''Golgo 13'' is the oldest manga still in publication, and its ''[[tankōbon]]'' edition has the [[List of manga series by volume count|third highest number of volumes]]. It has sold over 280 million copies in various formats, including compilation books, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history. It has been adapted into two live-action feature films, an [[anime]] film, an [[original video animation]], an anime television series and six video games.

==Story==
Golgo 13, also known by the pseudonym {{nihongo|Duke Togo|デューク・東郷|Dyūku Tōgō}}, is a professional assassin. His age and birthplace are unknown and there is no consensus in the worldwide intelligence community as to his true identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/contents/golgo/story/index.html | title = Golgo 13 profile | publisher = TV Tokyo | language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his jobs are completed through the use of a customized, scoped [[M16 rifle]]. Besides Duke Togo, Golgo 13's other aliases include {{nihongo|Tadashi Togo|東郷 隆|Tōgō Tadashi}} and {{nihongo|Togo Rodriguez|トーゴ・ロドリゲス|Tōgo Rodorigesu}}.

Duke Togo has a very quiet personality and will only talk when he needs to, he shows very little to no emotion when carrying out an assassination and is willing to kill anyone who will threaten to expose him. He accepts many different assassination jobs from anyone who can afford his services. From simply shooting a violin string to taking out powerful organized crime bosses and political figures, these killings have often attracted retaliations against Golgo 13, even at one stage having both the FBI, CIA, and even the United States military out to kill him, causing Togo to always have to watch his own back and pay attention to his surroundings in order to stop other assassins and contract killers employed to kill him in often creative ways. Golgo 13 also employs many different people himself to assist him in his assassination jobs, such as in providing extra information on his targets to modifying his weapons, vehicles, and gadgets.

The name &quot;Golgo 13&quot; is a reference to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the death of Jesus Christ]]. ''Golgo'' is short for [[Calvary|Golgotha]], the place of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' crucifixion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/5.6/30-anime_golgo.html|title=Anime Reviews: ''The Professional''|last=Washington|first=Darius|date=|website=|publisher=EX: The Online World of Anime &amp; Manga|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608105138/http://www.ex.org/5.6/30-anime_golgo.html|archive-date=8 June 2007|dead-url=yes|access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[13 (number)|number 13]] is considered an unlucky number because there were thirteen participants at Jesus' [[Last Supper]] before his execution. Also, Golgo 13's logo is a skeleton wearing a [[crown of thorns]].

Duke Togo's past is a mystery. Although his Asian appearance suggest that he may be of Japanese origin, many of Golgo 13's stories have presented many different speculations about his true identity, such stories always cast doubt on their own theories as well as presenting contradictory information, leaving the audience uncertain whether which information presented to them is true. It is known that he may be the biological father of many different children all over the world from the many sexual encounters he has had with women throughout the series, such as a 4-year-old son from an ex-Provisional Irish Republican Army terrorist Catherine McCall named Joey,&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 26&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Cold-Hearted Catherine|series=Golgo 13|credits=Director: Shunji Oga|network=TV Tokyo|airdate=October 26, 2008|number=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also another living son from a random previous sexual encounter seen in Episode 48.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 48&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Ebony Eyes|series=Golgo 13|credits=Director: Shunji Oga|network=TV Tokyo|airdate=March 13, 2009|number=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the character's age, a large number of stories are dated as they are centered around current events of the time. However, Golgo 13's age has not increased significantly to account for these events. He has also suffered multiple injuries throughout the series leaving many different scars around his body.&lt;ref name=&quot;DV&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailyvanguard.com/media/storage/paper941/news/2008/03/12/ArtsAndCulture/The-Perfect.Hit-3264891.shtml | title = Japanese manga series Golgo 13 is still important after 40 years | publisher = Vanguard | accessdate = 2008-04-16 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110620143441/http://www.psuvanguard.com/2.4061/the-perfect-hit-1.308243 | archivedate = 2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Early on Takao Saito developed a system where he creates the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inks the main characters' faces, while assistants provide the backgrounds and other elements. He does extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot deals with technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/style/AJ201312020004|title=Manga 'Golgo 13' celebrates 45 years of continuous publication|last=|first=|date=2 December 2013|website=|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024033726/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/style/AJ201312020004|archive-date=24 October 2015|dead-url=yes|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several stories of the series have not been reprinted for, according to [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]], being &quot;offensive or libelous.&quot; Thompson lists one from 1986 because of complaints from the Iranian Embassy in Japan, another from 1988 about [[money laundering]] in the Vatican, and one from 1989 about a Hollywood actor blackmailed when someone discovers he has [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2012-03-01|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Golgo 13|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2012-03-01|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Saito stated that because he often worried about his manga being cancelled, he had an ending planned out that even includes the panel layout. He said he had no idea when ''Golgo 13'' would end, claiming &quot;The manga has continued so long that it is no longer the property of the author; it belongs to the readers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-16/golgo-13-author-saito-discusses-manga-hypothetical-ending|title=Golgo 13 Author Saito Discusses Manga's Hypothetical Ending|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2013-11-16|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, ''Big Comic'''s fourth issue of 2015 announced that the series was &quot;heading towards its conclusion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-02-06/golgo-13-assassin-manga-heads-towards-conclusion/.84162|title=Golgo 13 Assassin Manga Heads 'Towards Conclusion'|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-02-06|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

===Manga===
Written and illustrated by [[Takao Saito]], ''Golgo 13'' has been serialized in the monthly manga magazine ''[[Big Comic]]'' since its January 1969 issue, published in October 1968. The chapters have been collected into ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes by [[Shogakukan]] and [[LEED Publishing]], a spinoff of the author's own Saito Production,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt; since June 21, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shogakukan.co.jp/comics/detail/_isbn_4845800012|script-title=ja:「ゴルゴ13 1」|publisher=[[Shogakukan]]|accessdate=2015-04-08|language=Japanese| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130212144735/http://www.shogakukan.co.jp/comics/detail/_isbn_4845800012 | archivedate = 2013-02-12| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2016, 183 volumes of the ''tankōbon'' edition have been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leed.co.jp/9784845835102|script-title=ja:ゴルゴ13 183|publisher=[[LEED Publishing]]|accessdate=2016-12-14|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[bunkoban]]'' edition has 148 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leed.co.jp/book/b2674.html|script-title=ja:ゴルゴ13 148|publisher=[[LEED Publishing]]|accessdate=2016-10-19|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, LEED Publishing released four ''Golgo 13'' stories translated by Patrick Connolly: &quot;Into the Wolves' Lair&quot;, &quot;Galinpero&quot;, &quot;The Ice Lake Hit&quot; and &quot;The Ivory Connection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.saito-pro.co.jp/golgo/english.htm | script-title=ja:ゴルゴ13 英語版 | language = Japanese | accessdate = 2008-04-16 | publisher = Saito Production }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 and 1990, LEED and [[Vic Tokai]] published two further ''Golgo 13'' comic books, &quot;The Impossible Hit&quot; and &quot;The Border Hopper&quot;, as part of the promotion for two ''Golgo 13'' video games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt; The comics were released to the US public via a mail-in offer with the purchase of the games and were later even found packaged with the video games. Each issue contained one complete story and had nothing to do with the storylines of the video games themselves.

In 1991, LEED Publishing and [[Viz Media]] published ''The Professional: Golgo 13'', a three part mini-series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt; ''The Professional'' was a re-printing of &quot;The Argentine Tiger&quot;, a story where Golgo is hired by the British Government to assassinate the reportedly dead ex-president of Argentina [[Juan Perón]].

In 2006, ''Golgo 13'' was brought back by Viz as part of their Viz Signature collection. The stories are picked from the forty-year history of the manga, and do not necessarily represent the original's order of publication. A total of thirteen volumes were published, with the thirteenth volume being published on February 19, 2008. Each volume ends with an editorial commentary on Golgo 13 as a cultural phenomenon in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;DV&quot;/&gt;

[[Toei Company]] produced a live-action film simply titled ''[[Golgo 13 (film)|Golgo 13]]'' in 1973, directed by [[Junya Sato]] and starring [[Ken Takakura]] in the title role. It was followed by ''[[Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon]]'' in 1977, directed by [[Yukio Noda]], which replaced Takakura with [[Sonny Chiba]]. In 2011, production company Davis Film obtained the American remake rights to Golgo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-09-10/davis-film-gets-golgo-13-assassin-manga-film-rights|title=Davis Film Gets Golgo 13 Assassin Manga's Film Rights|last=|first=|date=10 September 2011|work=|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Golgo 13: The Professional''===
{{main|Golgo 13: The Professional}}

''Golgo 13: The Professional'', known simply as ''Golgo 13'' in Japan, is a 1983 animated featured film. Golgo 13's voice is provided by [[Tetsurō Sagawa]] in the Japanese version, and [[Gregory Snegoff]] in [[Streamline Pictures]]' English dub.

''Golgo 13: The Professional'' incorporated [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI animation]], which was in its infancy at the time. This is most notable in the scene where army helicopters circle around Dawson Tower and attack Golgo as he climbs toward Dawson's office on the top floor.

===''Golgo 13: Queen Bee''===

===Video games===
Six [[video game]]s have been released: the first one, released for [[SG-1000]], followed by ''[[Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode]]'' on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[The Mafat Conspiracy]]'' and three Japan-only Arcade games, similar to the Silent Scope series, but with a few differences. The rifle only contained a magnifying lens, not a small monitor like Silent Scope. The screen itself would close up on the target only when the sensor on the underside of the rifle base was activated by the player leaning their shoulder into it. Each mission was preceded by a 8-10 panel manga briefing. The first two releases ran on Namco System 12 hardware, with the third on Namco System 10 hardware. A Golgo 13 game, ''Golgo 13: File G-13 o Oe'', was released for the [[Nintendo DS]] on June 18, 2009 by [[Marvelous Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/ds/G13/top.html|title=Spec, Official Golgo 13: File G-13 o Oe|accessdate=2009-07-08|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Marvelous Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From initial reports, the game appears to consist of a large quiz mode, featuring questions spanning the 40-year history of Golgo 13, as well as several mini-games, including the &quot;Don't Stand Behind Me&quot; game, in which the player, as Golgo 13, must punch people who walk up behind him. At the end of each episode of the anime, the tagline was &quot;Don't stand behind him, if you value your life.&quot; The game is played holding the DS on its side, also known as &quot;book style&quot; and surprisingly seems to be rated the Japanese equivalent of General/All Ages, which suggests the game won't feature much or any graphic violence or adult/mature subject matter, some of Golgo 13's trademarks. A version of Golgo 13's signature weapon, the scoped M16, was released in the Japanese version of [[Alliance of Valiant Arms]] as a usable weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMDugHLD4rQ|title=AVA M16 Golgo13 Edition in GALLERY - YouTube |accessdate=2014-06-29|language=Japanese|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There was also a LCD game based on Golgo 13 released only in Japan by Popy in 1982.

===Other media===
In addition, the title character has appeared in a number of TV commercials in Japan, including [[NEC]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc_RbJrtOic YouTube - NEC Commercial Featuring Golgo 13]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] [[Black Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG_rdCmG0VY |title=Lotte Black Black |last= |first= |date= |website=www.youtube.com |publisher= |dead-url=yes |access-date=19 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412121817/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG_rdCmG0VY |archivedate=12 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a [[radio drama]] featuring [[Masane Tsukayama]] as Golgo 13.

An [[Airsoft]] gun has been made by [[Tokyo Marui]] based on the rifle Golgo 13 uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyo-marui.co.jp/products/electric/standard/240|title=Official Golgo 13 M16 Page|accessdate=2013-01-29|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Tokyo Marui]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figure based on Golgo 13 was released on August 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B002AMVCQM/ |title=figma ゴルゴ13|accessdate=2009-07-08|publisher=Amazon Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nekomagic.com/?p=5391|title=Golgo 13 figma 042 action figure by Max Factory|date=2009-05-21|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Saito's work on the series has been compared to the novels of [[John le Carré]] and [[Frederick Forsyth]], as the stories are &quot;dark, meticulously constructed [and] painstakingly realistic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/golgo-13-gn-4|title=''Golgo 13'' GN 4 - Review|last=Kimlinger|first=Carl|date=8 October 2006|website=|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Daily Vanguard]] calls Duke &quot;a badass, something like a cross between [[Dirty Harry]] and ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear Solid]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Solid Snake]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DV&quot;/&gt;

Jc DuBois of Dragon's Anime has criticized those who say that most of Golgo 13's hits are impossible to do since there are problems that would prevent him from shooting straight such as the wind or with the [[coriolis effect]], saying that the &quot;whole mystique of Golgo 13 is that he's just that damn good. He CAN make those shots – and he can do it with one shot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dragonsanime.com/reviews/anime-review-archive/5-anime-reviews/218-golgo-13-tv-2008-jc.html|title=Golgo 13 (TV, 2008)|last=DuBois|first=JC|date=9 September 2008|website=dragonsanime.com|publisher=DragonsAnime|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815054815/http://dragonsanime.com/reviews/anime-review-archive/5-anime-reviews/218-golgo-13-tv-2008-jc.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|dead-url=yes|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gollum''' is a fictional character from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]]. He was introduced in the 1937  [[Juvenile fantasy|fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and became an important supporting character in its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Gollum was a [[Hobbit#Divisions|Stoor Hobbit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|UT|Part Three, IV. &quot;The Hunt for the Ring&quot;, p 353, note 9}}. In a letter quoted by Christopher Tolkien, Tolkien refers to Déagol and Sméagol as Stoors.&lt;/ref&gt; of the River-folk, who lived near the [[Gladden Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lord-of-the-rings.org/books/gollum.html|title=Gollum|publisher=Lord of the Rings Fantasy World|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally known as '''Sméagol''', he was corrupted by the [[One Ring]] and later named Gollum after his habit of making &quot;a horrible swallowing noise in his throat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|hobbit|&quot;Riddles in the Dark&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Appendix F of ''The Lord of the Rings'', the name Sméagol is said to be a &quot;translation&quot; of the actual Middle-earth name ''Trahald'' (having to do with the idea of &quot;burrowing&quot;, and rendered with a name based on [[Old English]] ''smygel'' of similar meaning).&lt;ref&gt;See definition: {{Cite web|url=http://www.bosworthtoller.com/028184 |title=smygel|work=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] (Online) | author=Bosworth, Joseph | authorlink=Joseph Bosworth |author2=Toller, T. Northcote | location=Prague | publisher=[[Charles University]]}} - a derivation of the verb ''smúgan'', which is the basis for the name of [[Smaug]], the dragon&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ring, which Gollum referred to as &quot;my precious&quot; or &quot;precious&quot;, extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he had &quot;come to love and hate the Ring, just as he loved and hated himself.&quot; Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it. [[Bilbo Baggins]] found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life. Gollum finally seized the Ring from [[Frodo Baggins]] at the Cracks of Doom in [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] in [[Mordor]]; but he fell into the fires of the volcano, where both he and the Ring were destroyed.

==Appearances==

===''The Hobbit''===
Gollum was first introduced in ''the Hobbit'' as &quot;a small, slimy creature&quot; who lived on a small island in the centre of an [[underground lake]] at the roots of the [[Misty Mountains]]. He survived on cave fish, which he caught from his small boat, and small [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]] who strayed too far from the stronghold of the [[Great Goblin]]. Over the years, his eyes adapted to the dark and became &quot;lamp-like&quot;, shining with a sickly pale light.

[[Bilbo Baggins]] stumbled upon Gollum's lair, having found Gollum's ring in the network of goblin tunnels leading down to the lake. At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a [[Riddle#Riddles as a game|riddle game]] with Gollum on the chance of being shown the way out of the mountains.  In the first edition of ''The Hobbit'', Gollum was characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo the way out of the mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'',  Tolkien revised later editions of ''The Hobbit'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/booksbytolkien/hobbit/editions.htm|title=Tolkien Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; the version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and [[Gandalf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tolkien.slimy.com/tfaq/Tolkien.html|title=Tolkien FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new version Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realized the answer to Bilbo's last riddle&amp;nbsp;— &quot;What have I got in my pocket?&quot;&amp;nbsp;— and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, &quot;Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!&quot;

===''The Lord of the Rings''===

====''The Fellowship of the Ring''====
''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', the first volume of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', explains that Gollum's real name was Sméagol, and he had once been a member of the secluded branch of the early Stoorish [[Hobbit]]s. He spent the early years of his life with his extended family under a [[matriarch]], his grandmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|#214}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Sméagol's birthday, he and his relative&lt;!--NOT &quot;COUSIN&quot;--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; [[Déagol]] went fishing in the [[Gladden Fields]] north of [[Lothlórien]]. There, Déagol found the Ring in the riverbed after being pulled into the water by a fish. Sméagol fell immediately under the Ring's influence and demanded it as a birthday present; when Déagol refused, Sméagol strangled him. Sméagol later used the Ring for thieving, spying and antagonizing his friends and relatives, who nicknamed him &quot;Gollum&quot; for the swallowing noise he made in his throat, until his grandmother expelled him from the family. He wandered in the wilderness for a few years until he finally retreated to a deep cavern in the Misty Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|FotR|p. 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ring's malignant influence twisted his body and mind, and prolonged his life well beyond its natural limits.

Gollum left his cave in pursuit of Bilbo a few years after losing the Ring, but the trail was cold. He made his way to the edge of [[Mordor]], where he met the monstrous spider [[Shelob]] and became her spy, worshipping her and bringing her food. He was eventually captured by [[Sauron|Sauron's]] forces and tortured, revealing to Sauron the names of &quot;Baggins&quot; and &quot;the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]]&quot;. His testimony alerted the Dark Lord of Mordor to the existence and significance of Hobbits in general and the Baggins family in particular. He was freed, but was soon caught by Gandalf and [[Aragorn]], who interrogated him about the Ring and placed him in the care of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood Elves]] of [[Mirkwood]]. He escaped them (with the help of Sauron's [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]) and descended into [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]].

Gollum picked up the trail and began following the Fellowship of the Ring in Moria, only to be spotted or heard by [[Frodo Baggins]] (younger cousin and heir of Bilbo, as well as the Bearer of the Ring), Gandalf, and Aragorn on several occasions. Gollum continued trailing the Fellowship to the edge of Lórien. Gollum began following them again as they left and followed them all the way to [[Rauros]], then pursued Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] across the [[Emyn Muil]] when they struck out on their own towards Mordor.

====''The Two Towers''====
In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Frodo and Sam confronted Gollum in the Emyn Muil; Gollum nearly strangled Sam, but Frodo subdued him with his [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] sword, [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], which had once belonged to Bilbo. Frodo tied an Elvish rope around Gollum's ankle as a leash, but the mere touch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature, just as Bilbo once had, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the &quot;precious&quot; itself, and Frodo released him. The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made their way to the [[Morannon|Black Gate]], the main entrance to Mordor. Frodo's kindness brought out Gollum's better nature, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. Sam, however, despised Gollum upon sight, and often warned Frodo of the creature's deception and slipperiness.

When they reached the Black Gate and found it well-guarded, Gollum offered to lead them toward an alternate entrance into Mordor. Along the way, Frodo and Sam were seized by [[Faramir]], and Gollum slipped away uncaught (but not unseen) and followed them. When Frodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner in order to spare his life, Gollum felt betrayed, and began plotting against his new &quot;master&quot;. Faramir found out that Gollum was taking them to [[Cirith Ungol]], and warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that place, as well as the treachery he sensed in Gollum.

Frodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and began climbing the stairs to Cirith Ungol in the border-mountains of the [[Ephel Dúath]]. Gollum slipped away and visited Shelob, planning to feed the Hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself when she was done. When he returned, he found the Hobbits asleep, and the sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into [[Torech Ungol|Shelob's Lair]]. There, Frodo was stung by the giant spider, taken prisoner by Orcs, and hauled to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.

====''The Return of the King''====
In ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from Cirith Ungol and, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, the two began to make their way across the [[Gorgoroth (Middle-earth)|plateau of Gorgoroth]]. They finally arrived, against all odds, at [[Mount Doom]], the only place where the Ring could be destroyed. However, Gollum had secretly followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life out of pity, and turned his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature and followed Frodo.

Moments later, Frodo stood on the edge of the Crack of Doom, but was unwilling to destroy the Ring, claiming it for himself and putting it on. Gollum struck again, and struggled with the invisible Frodo. Finally, Gollum bit off Frodo's finger and seized the Ring. He gloated over his &quot;prize&quot;, dancing madly, but stepped over the edge and fell into the lava, taking the Ring with him with a last cry of &quot;Precious!&quot; Thus, the Ring was destroyed and Sauron defeated. Sam cursed Gollum after his death, but Frodo urged his friend to forgive him, as without him the quest would have failed and the [[War of the Ring]] would have been lost. Tolkien later wrote that it was direct intervention by [[Eru Ilúvatar|Eru]], Middle-earth's version of [[God]], that led to Gollum's &quot;accident&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance and characteristics==
[[File:Gollum s journey commences by Frederic Bennett.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;An artist's impression of Gollum,&lt;br&gt;by Frederic Bennett.]]
In the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' Tolkien made no reference to Gollum's size, leading several illustrators to portray him as being very large.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Douglas ''The Annotated Hobbit'', &quot;Riddles in the Dark&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien realized the omission, and clarified in later editions that he was of average Hobbit size. ''The Lord of the Rings'' characterizes him as slightly larger than Samwise Gamgee.

Tolkien describes Gollum as either dark, bone-white or sallow; at one point the [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of [[Ithilien]] mistake his silhouette seen from a distance for that of a tailless black squirrel. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the appearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that Gollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor light.&lt;ref name=&quot;ME-ref|RC|pg 447&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|RC|pg 447}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Hobbit'' states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth-sharpening-rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing.

''The Hobbit'' describes him as thin, with only six teeth sharpened into points.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Teeth! teeth! my preciousss; but we has only six!&quot; {{ME-ref|hobbit||&quot;Riddles in the Dark&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing him to Shelob, one of the Orcs describes him as &quot;rather like a spider himself, or perhaps like a starved frog.&quot;

Gollum is described as &quot;a small slimy creature&quot; (in ''The Hobbit''), and emaciated and gaunt, but possessing a vicious, wiry strength. In ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', Aragorn states &quot;his malice gives him a strength hardly to be imagined.&quot; In ''The Two Towers'', Gollum's grip is described as &quot;soft, but horribly strong&quot; as he wrestles with Sam.

===Personality===
Besides his appearance, in personality Gollum is described by Tolkien in the chapter &quot;The Taming of Sméagol&quot;, after he had been captured by Sam and Frodo:

{{quote|text=For that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with laughter and caper if any jest was made, or even if Frodo spoke kindly to him, and weep if Frodo rebuked him.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppA&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Return of the King|1955|loc=Appendix A: I (iv), pp. 335–6|Ref=Return of the King}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gollum hated everything Elf-made. In ''The Two Towers'', Sam bound Gollum's leg with Elven rope, which caused Gollum excruciating pain. He was also unable or unwilling to eat lembas bread.

===Speech===
Gollum speaks in an idiosyncratic manner, often [[illeism|referring to himself in the third person]], and frequently talks to himself. When not referring to himself in the 3rd person, he sometimes speaks of himself in the plural as &quot;we&quot;, hinting at his split personality. The rare occasions when he actually says &quot;I&quot; are interpreted by Frodo as an indication that Sméagol's better self has the upper hand. Gollum also uses his own versions of words similar to the original words. He usually [[Reduplicated plural|adds -es to the end of a plural]], resulting in words such as &quot;hobbitses&quot; instead of hobbits, &quot;Bagginses&quot; instead of Baggins, or &quot;birdses&quot; instead of birds. When forming the present tense of verbs, he frequently extends the 3rd person singular ending -s to other persons and numbers, resulting in constructions like &quot;we ''hates'' it&quot; (by analogy with &quot;he hates it&quot;). In general, Gollum is represented as very fond of [[sibilant]]s, often drawing them out. Within Tolkien's larger scheme, English in the books represents the [[Westron]] or Common Tongue of Middle-earth. Gollum is thus understood to have spoken Westron in a non-standard way, which is then translated as non-standard English. Since he is often described as hissing, the fondness for sibilants was apparently an actual feature of his idiosyncratic Westron.

===Age===
Due to the influence of the One Ring, Gollum's life was extended far beyond that of other members of his clan. An average Hobbit lifespan is over 100 years, but a span of 556 years separates Gollum's finding of the Ring in {{ME-date|TA|2463|link=no}} and its destruction in T.A. 3019, by which time he would have been approaching an age of 600 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/smeagol.html|title = Sméagol|publisher = The Encyclopedia of Arda|accessdate = 25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Film and stage===
[[File:Gollum 1977 225x169.jpg|220px|thumb|Gollum in [[Rankin/Bass]]'s animated version of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'']]
[[File:BakshiGollum.JPG|220px|thumb|Gollum in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s animated version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'']]
[[File:Gollum.PNG|220px|thumb|Gollum in [[Peter Jackson]]'s live-action version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. He was voiced and performed by [[Andy Serkis]].|left]]

In the [[Rankin/Bass]] adaptations of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980), Gollum appears as a frog-like creature with large, lamp-like eyes. His voice is provided by [[Brother Theodore]]. Despite Tolkien's description,&lt;ref name=&quot;ME-ref|RC|pg 447&quot;/&gt; Gollum is portrayed as almost naked, save for a loin-cloth.

In [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s animated film of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1978), the voice of Gollum was supplied by [[Peter Woodthorpe]], who also reprised the role in the [[BBC]]'s 1981 [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|radio serial]].

In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era television film ''Сказочное путешествие мистера Бильбо Бэггинса, Хоббита'' ([[The Hobbit (1985 film)|The Fairytale Journey of Mr. Bilbo Baggins, The Hobbit]]), Gollum is portrayed by [[Igor Dmitriev]].

[[Kari Väänänen]] portrayed Gollum ({{lang-fi|Klonkku}}) in the 1993 live-action television miniseries ''[[Hobitit]]'' [The Hobbits] that was produced and broadcast by the Finnish network [[Yle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kajava |first=Jukka |title=Tolkienin taruista on tehty tv-sarja: Hobitien ilme syntyi jo Ryhmäteatterin Suomenlinnan tulkinnassa |trans_title=Tolkien's tales have been turned into a TV series: The Hobbits have been brought to live in the Ryhmäteatteri theatre | work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |language=Finnish |date=29 March 1993 |url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/?haku=Klonkku&amp;ref=arkisto%2F&amp;page=4}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], Gollum is a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] character voiced and performed by actor [[Andy Serkis]]. He is smaller than both Frodo and Sam. Barely glimpsed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001), he becomes a central character in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003). The CGI character was built around Serkis' facial features, voice, and acting choices. Serkis based the iconic &quot;''gollum''&quot; throat noise on the sound of his cat coughing up hairballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Serkis|first=Andy|year=2003|title=[[Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic]]|location=London|publisher=Harper Collins|page=4|ISBN=0-618-39104-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a digital puppet created by Jason Schleifer and [[Bay Raitt]] at [[Weta Digital]], animators created Gollum's performance using a mixture of [[motion capture]] data recorded from Serkis and the traditional animation process of [[Key frame]], along with the laborious process of digitally [[rotoscoping]] Serkis' image and replacing it with the digital Gollum's in a technique coined ''rotoanimation''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotoanimation&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - Special Extended DVD Edition, The Appendices Part Three: The Journey Continues|medium=DVD|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work required a large number of digital artists. As in the animated depictions of the character, Gollum is shown as virtually naked save for a loincloth in the trilogy.

In ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'', Serkis himself appears in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scene as Sméagol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for ''The Two Towers'', but was held back because the screenwriters felt audiences would relate better to the original Sméagol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Raitt and [[Jamie Beswarick]] had to redesign Gollum's face for the second and third movies so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'. The brief glimpses in ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' are of an earlier model of Gollum.

In Jackson's films, Gollum has a split personality: the childlike &quot;Sméagol&quot; and the evil &quot;Gollum&quot;. Screenwriters [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] included scenes in ''The Two Towers'', ''The Return of the King'' and ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' in which &quot;Gollum&quot; and &quot;Sméagol&quot; argue, with Serkis slightly altering his voice and body language to play the two as separate entities.  His dual personality was also emphasized by different pupil dilation&amp;nbsp;— &quot;Gollum&quot; has small, piercing pupils and &quot;Sméagol&quot; larger, noticeably dilated pupils&amp;nbsp;— and by positioning the two on different sides of the screen.

Serkis and Gollum appeared on the [[2003 MTV Movie Awards]], when Gollum won &quot;Best Virtual Performance&quot; and went on to deliver an obscenity-laden acceptance speech in character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364913/quotes Quotes from the 2003 [[MTV Movie Awards]] - Internet Movie Database]&lt;/ref&gt; The speech itself was so well received that it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2004-hugos/ |title=2004 Hugo Awards |work=

Serkis once again played Gollum in the prequel film ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'', released in 2012. In the film, Gollum drops the ring while killing a goblin, rather than having lost the ring by the time Bilbo finds it.&lt;ref&gt;Winning, Josh. [http://www.totalfilm.com/news/andy-serkis-will-direct-the-hobbit-s-second-unit &quot;Andy Serkis Will Direct The Hobbit's second unit&quot;] ''Total Film''. 7 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gollum also appears in ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'', the independently-produced 2009 prequel to the Jackson films directed by Chris Bouchard. Bouchard's CGI Gollum is directly inspired by Gollum in the Jackson films.

In Canada, Gollum was portrayed by [[Michael Therriault]] in the three-hour stage production of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which opened in 2006 in [[Toronto]].

Gollum also appears in a three-part comic book adaptation of ''The Hobbit'', scripted by [[Chuck Dixon]] and Sean Deming and illustrated by David Wenzel. It was first published by [[Eclipse Comics]] in 1989. A reprint collected in one volume was released by [[Unwin Paperbacks]] in 1990 and by [[Del Rey Books]] in 2001.

===In other media===
[[File:Berlin Wall Gollum.jpg|right|thumb|A [[graffiti]] art depiction of Gollum on the [[East Side Gallery]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] (2008)]]
Gollum is referenced in the song &quot;[[Ramble On]]&quot; by Led Zeppelin on their 1969 album ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]''.  In the 2011 film ''[[Attack the Block]]'', the invading aliens are referred to as &quot;gollums.&quot;

In [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'', a [[real-time strategy]] game based solely on the book, Gollum is a playable hero unit for the Minions of Sauron. [[Legolas]] and a guard of archers track him through Mirkwood, fighting giant spiders along the way.

In ''[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|The Hobbit]]'' video game by [[Vivendi Universal]], released in 2003, Gollum appears in one [[cutscene]] depicting the scene in which he and Bilbo play the riddle game before Gollum discovers that Bilbo has the ring and inadvertently leads Bilbo out of the Misty Mountains.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' video game by [[Surreal Software]], also based only on the book, Gollum appears in a cutscene when the Fellowship of the Ring is within Moria, and is shown half hidden behind debris muttering to himself. He also appears during the final level at [[Amon Hen]]; when the user is playing as Aragorn, Gollum appears on a cliff edge muttering to himself and walks away, and then does the same on another cliff edge. Then the player heads to a small island and a cutscene can be shown with a conversation between Aragorn and Gollum, in which Gollum throws a fish at him; it becomes his weapon for the final mission, as well as the most powerful weapon in the game.

He also appears in [[Electronic Arts]]' games based on the Jackson films. In the real-time strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', Gollum is a playable hero unit for Mordor. In its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', which is also based on the film series, he is not playable. Instead, he walks around the map cloaked, carrying the Ring. When killed, he drops the Ring for a player to claim. When the Ring is returned to the player's fortress, they may summon a special &quot;Ring Hero&quot;&amp;nbsp;— [[Galadriel]] for good factions and Sauron for evil. He also appears in the action game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (based on the 2003 film), voiced by Andy Serkis. He is an [[Non-player character|NPC]] who accompanies Frodo and Sam (the player) as the game progresses, but at Mount Doom becomes the final boss, whom the player must throw into the lava below. In the [[Game Boy]] version of ''The Return of the King'', he is a playable bonus character.

He appears in the video game ''[[Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]].



A Lego minifig version of Gollum, in his design from Andy Serkins' character, is playable in [[Lego The Lord of the Rings]], (with archive voice dialogues of Andy Serkins), where he also serves as the final boss, and in [[Lego Dimensions]]. His abilities include acrobatic skills and a boomerang fish. Liam O'Brien reprises the voice role.

A new species of cave-dwelling [[Opiliones|harvestmen]] first described in 2015 was named ''Iandumoema smeagol'' in reference to Gollum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A new highly specialized cave harvestman from Brazil and the first blind species of the genus: ''Iandumoema smeagol'' sp. n.

The genus contains five species of air-breathing sea slugs which live in inter-tidal zones in the shores of New Zealand and Australia.

===Court incident===
In 2014, Turkish physician Bilgin Çiftçi shared an image comparing Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] to Gollum. As a result of administrative investigation, he was expelled from service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erdoğan’a hakarette ‘Gollum’ cezası: Doktor memuriyetten men edildi|url=http://www.diken.com.tr/erdogana-hakarette-gollum-cezasi-doktoru-memuriyetten-men-ettiler/|publisher=Diken|accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Erdoğan sued Çiftçi for insulting him, demanding 2-years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Goneril''' is a character in [[Shakespeare]]'s tragic play ''[[King Lear]]'' (1605). She is the eldest of King Lear's three daughters. Along with her sister [[Regan (King Lear)|Regan]], Goneril is considered a [[villain]],&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Thomas. ''The Image of Family in King Lear''. Shakespearean Criticism Vol. 73. 2003. Gale Literature Resources Center, Web. 25 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; obsessed with power and overthrowing her elderly father as ruler of the kingdom of Britain. Her aggressiveness is a rare trait for a female character in [[Elizabethan literature]].

Shakespeare based the character on ''Gonorilla'', a personage described by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his pseudohistorical chronicle ''[[Historia regum Britanniae]]'' (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;, {{circa|1138}}) as the eldest of the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|British king]] [[Leir of Britain|Lear]]'s three daughters, alongside Regan and [[Cordelia of Britain|Cordeilla]] (the source for [[Cordelia (King Lear)|Cordelia]]), and the mother of [[Marganus]].

==Analysis==
The earliest example of her deceitful tendencies occurs in the first act. Without a male heir, Lear is prepared to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, as long as they express their true love to him. Knowing her response will get her closer to the throne, Goneril professes, &quot;Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter&quot; (1.1. 53).&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''King Lear''. ''The Norton Shakespeare: Tragedies''. Ed. Greenblatt, Cohen, Howard, Maus. W.W Norton and Company, 1997. 707–781.&lt;/ref&gt; She has no reservations about lying to her father.

She finally begins to show her true colours when Lear asks to stay with her and her husband. She tells him to send away his knights and servants because they are too loud and too numerous. Livid that he is being disrespected, Lear curses her and leaves.

Goneril, the wife of the Duke of [[Scotland|Albany]] (an archaic name for Scotland), has an intimate relationship with [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]], one that may have been played up in the earlier editions of ''King Lear''.&lt;ref&gt;Auden, W.H. ''Lectures on Shakespeare''. ed. Kirsch, Arthur. Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 2000. 219-230&lt;/ref&gt; She writes a note encouraging Edmund to kill her husband and marry her, but it is discovered. In the final act, Goneril discovers that Regan desires Edmund as well and poisons her sister’s drink, killing her. However, once Edmund is mortally wounded, Goneril goes offstage and kills herself.

'''Gong Runbo''' ({{zh|s=宫润伯|t=宮潤伯|p=Gōng Rùnbó}}; 1972 - 31 December 2006) was a [[China|Chinese]] [[serial killer]] who, between March 2005 and February 2006, murdered at least six children between the ages of 9 and 16. Forensic evidence led police to believe he may have killed over twenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkiller_news/R/RUNBO_gong.php | title=RUNBO Gong | accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gong was imprisoned in October 1996 for the rape of a 15-year-old girl. He was released in 2004 after serving an eight-year sentence. He [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] and murdered six children in the city of [[Jiamusi]], in northeast China's [[Heilongjiang Province]]. He also lured and [[child sexual abuse|molested]] five others aged 12 and 13. 

Gong was arrested on February 28, 2006 when a boy escaped from his apartment and called the police. The police captured Gong in a nearby [[Internet cafe]] and found four [[decomposing]] bodies and children's clothes in his apartment. He was executed on 31 December 2006.

The series has been filmed, at least in part, in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=WECT Staff |date=February 29, 2016 |access-date=March 4, 2016 |title=TNT series 'Good Behavior' to continue filming in Wilmington |url=http://www.wect.com/story/31342571/tnt-series-good-behavior-to-continue-filming-in-wilmington |publisher=[[WECT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Letty Raines, a flawed and recently released from prison thief and con artist, is intent on gaining custody of her 10-year-old bi-racial son Jacob. Her mother, Estelle, has custody and, because of Letty's incarceration, has a restraining [[order of protection]] that restricts contact. She infrequently sees her [[parole]] officer, Christian, who is exasperated by her attitude and lack of progress. While robbing a hotel room Letty, hiding in the closet, overhears a discussion about a contract killing. Her unsuccessful effort to prevent the killing creates a series-long involvement with the killer, Javier, to the point of a sexual and personal relationship and participation in subsequent &quot;hits&quot; and a startling family reunion.&lt;ref name=&quot;TNTPress&quot; /&gt;

'''''Good Neighbours''''' is a 2010 Canadian black comedy-thriller film which was written and directed by [[Jacob Tierney]]. It is based on the book by [[Chrystine Brouillet]].

==Plot==
Louise works as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant in the [[Notre Dame de Grace|Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]] neighbourhood of [[Montreal]] where she lives.  She has become obsessed with the story of a recent spate of serial murders committed in the area, and scours newspapers for stories about each victim. The latest victim is a co-worker who last spoke of a blond, muscular man she met at the bar, and with whom she had a drink after she got off work at midnight.  Louise's wheelchair-bound neighbour, Spencer, shares her interest to a point but values his privacy and solitude.  When Victor, an awkward and talkative elementary school teacher, moves in to their apartment complex, he ingratiates himself into their lives and attempts to strike up a friendship, which they reluctantly accept.  Louise, who prefers the company of her cats to humans, warms to Victor when he reveals that he is also a cat owner.  

When their abusive Francophone neighbor Valérie poisons Louise's cats, Louise spends more time at Victor's apartment, though she requests alone time with his cat.  Victor, who has developed a crush on Louise, invents an imaginary love life with her and tells his friends that they have become engaged, though Louise denies any romantic feelings for Victor when Spencer probes her.  When Spencer dispassionately reveals to Victor that he was paralyzed in a car accident that killed his wife, Spencer  rejects Victor's sympathy and later reacts angrily when Victor installs a wheelchair-accessible ramp in the building.  During the cover of night, Spencer sneaks out his window and climbs the fire escape, secretly enjoying the city's nightlife.  During one of his secretive outings, one of Victor's friends spots him, though Victor dismisses the possibility that it could be Spencer.

Louise uses sensationalist media reports to plan the murder of Valérie.  After seducing Victor, she collects his sperm and uses it to give the impression that Valérie has been raped.  On the way back to her apartment, holding evidence of her guilt, she runs into Spencer, who has gone out for a nighttime jog; caught in compromising positions, the two awkwardly acknowledge each other without asking any questions.  Curious about the noise, Victor looks out his window and sees Spencer, whom he begins to suspect is the serial killer.  Following a dinner party, where the three cautiously probe each other for information, Spencer outright suggests that Louise and he frame Victor for the deaths.  At the same time, Victor proposes that Louise and he set a trap for Spencer.  Louise agrees to both plans.  As Spencer breaks into Victor's apartment, the police rush to his help, and Spencer flees to the fire escape toward Louise's apartment.  Worried for her safety, Victor confronts Spencer, and Spencer falls to his death; Louise disinterestedly ignores the conflict as she feeds Victor's cat, whom she has adopted.

&quot;'''Good Times with Weapons'''&quot; is episode 112 of ''[[South Park]]''.  The first episode of [[South Park (season 8)|season 8]], it originally aired on March 17, 2004. The episode's [[animation]] routinely switches from the usual [[cutout animation|cutout]]-and-solid-color style to a highly stylized [[anime]] theme. [[Music of Asia|Asian]]-style [[ambient music|ambience]] plays in the background.

This was also one of ten episodes to be featured on ''South Park: The Hits'' DVD.  In addition, it was voted the 2nd best episode of all time by fans in the [[United States]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} while being ranked the third best among fans in the [[United Kingdom]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} This episode was one of the first to be available in [[high-definition television|high definition]], available on the [[Xbox 360]]'s [[Xbox Live Marketplace|Marketplace]]. A promotional [[HD DVD]] was also released exclusively for [[Best Buy]].

This was the first episode with [[April Stewart]] as the bulk of the female characters following [[Eliza Schneider]]'s departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|705928|Good Times with Weapons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At the [[Park County, Colorado|Park County]] Fair, the boys come across a vendor selling &quot;authentic weapons from the [[Far East]]&quot; and are interested in purchasing them. Although the vendor says parental permission is required if the hopeful buyer is under 18 years old, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] uses this information to pretend that he, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] are orphaned brothers (a ruse the boys have apparently successfully used &quot;like twelve times&quot; in the past) and successfully tricks the vendor into giving them the weapons. Stan purchases a pair of [[Tonfa]], Kyle gets [[nunchaku]], Cartman buys a pair of [[sai (weapon)|sai]], and Kenny purchases (according to Cartman) the only thing he can afford, a pair of [[shuriken|''shaken''-style shuriken]]. After showing their weapons off to [[Craig (South Park)|Craig]], they go around town pretending to be ninjas, becoming [[anime]]-like characters with their own individual [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s. The animation style takes on an overall Japanese look and switches to a [[Anamorphic format|cinemascope]] aspect ratio whenever this happens. 

Butters sees them playing and wants to join but the boys refuse to let him. He goes home and becomes his [[supervillain]] [[alter ego]], [[Butters Stotch#Professor Chaos|Professor Chaos]], and sets off to get his revenge on the four ninjas. Not realizing who he actually is, the boys agree to engage in battle with their new enemy. Professor Chaos gains the upper hand by neutralizing Kyle and Stan and Cartman proves no help as he prefers to use his ninja power to embarrass Kyle. Kenny comes to their defense and throws one of his shuriken.

The shuriken hits Butters in his eye and becomes lodged in it, which immediately brings an end to the battle and brings the boys back to their senses. Suddenly they all realize that Butters needs medical attention, but taking him to the local hospital would result in their parents finding out about their purchases. They try to pull the shuriken out of Butters' eye themselves but when that only makes things worse, Stan and Cartman decide that the only way they can take Butters to a doctor is if they go to the local veterinarian and dress Butters up like a dog. 

[[File:SP Good Times With Weapons.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Butters after being dressed up as a dog]]
On the way, the boys encounter Craig again and have to hide Butters in an abandoned oven so nobody sees him. Much to their chagrin, Craig has copied them and obtained weapons from the same vendor, enlisting [[Jimmy (South Park)|Jimmy]], [[Clyde (South Park)|Clyde]], and [[Token Black|Token]] as his fellow ninjas. The two ninja groups fight, but in the chaos Butters escapes. The four boys force Craig's group to help them search for Butters, threatening to tell on them if they do not.

A weakened Butters makes his way to the hospital but his disguise fools the attending doctor, who sends Butters to the local animal shelter. There, the veterinarian determines that the only thing to do is to [[animal euthanasia|put Butters to sleep]]. Just before he does, Butters escapes again and heads for the fair. So he decides to put another dog to sleep.

The boys decide to dispose of the evidence and return to the fair to have the vendor refund their money, which he refuses to do. Craig and the others inform them that they have seen Butters wandering around on the other side of the fair towards an auction that all their parents are attending. Cartman decides to use his ninja power of [[invisibility]] to walk across the auction stage to get to Butters undetected and takes off his clothes. However, since nobody else knows what the boys have been up to, Cartman inadvertently ends up [[streaking]] across the stage and is unable to reach Butters, who collapses on the stage while everyone looks on stunned.

The final scene shows the townsfolk protesting at an emergency meeting about the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|outrage at the auction]]. The boys are under the impression that the outrage in question is Butters' wound (which has by this time been medically treated), but it soon transpires that the real issue is Cartman's [[public nudity]]. Cartman explains that it was a &quot;[[wardrobe malfunction]]&quot;, and the episode ends with the other three boys addressing the issue that adults are more offended by sex than by violence, allowing them to keep their weapons. The episode ends with a freeze-frame of the boys in Anime style posing and embarking on another adventure as they have more work to do.

==Development==
In spite of the episode's popularity among fans, Parker and Stone openly admitted in the Season 8 commentary track that they did not think it was a very good episode.

This episode features &quot;Let's Fighting Love&quot;, a [[theme music|theme song]] that mixes [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[English language|English]] [[lyrics]]. The song is performed by series creator Trey Parker.&lt;ref name=&quot;GTW1&quot;&gt;Audio Commentary on &quot;Good Times with Weapons&quot; with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, &quot;South Park: The Hits, Vol. 1&quot;, Comedy Central Home Entertainment, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square''''' is a 1966 novel by [[Arthur La Bern]], which was the basis for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972).

==Plot==
The novel and film tell the story of Bob Rusk, a [[serial killer]] in [[London]] who [[rape]]s and strangles women. Because of [[circumstantial evidence]], however, the police come to suspect Rusk's friend Richard Blamey.

==Film adaptation==
The novel was adapted for the screen by [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]. The title is taken from a line in the popular British [[music hall]] hit &quot;[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]&quot;.

La Bern expressed his dissatisfaction with the adaptation in a [[letter to the editor]] of ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/hitchcock/wiki/The_Times_%2829/May/1972%29_-_Letters_to_the_Editor:_Hitchcock%27s_%22Frenzy%22 Letters to the Editor: Hitchcock's &quot;Frenzy&quot;, ''The Times'', 29 May 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant differences between the original novel and Hitchcock's film. The scenes between Inspector Oxford and his wife are not in the book. In La Bern's novel, the first murder is depicted from the murderer's viewpoint, with the reader unaware of his identity. A later scene also begins from the murderer's viewpoint, but midway through the scene the narrative suddenly reveals that he is Bob Rusk.

In the novel, the man falsely convicted of the murders is named Blamey, not Blaney, and nicknamed Blameworthy. Most significantly, while Hitchcock set his film in the 1970s, the original novel takes place shortly after [[World War II]]. Richard Blamey was a [[Royal Air Force]] veteran who had participated in the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden fire-bombing]] as &quot;chief candle dropper&quot;: he dropped the incendiary flares that enabled the bombers to find their targets. In the novel, he feels guilty for this. Blamey is drunk and confused when the police first interrogate him about the necktie murders, and he claims to have committed previous murders in [[Dresden]]. When a police officer asks him how many people he killed in Dresden, Blamey replies &quot;thousands&quot;. This drunken confession is a factor in his eventual false conviction for the necktie murders.

An Indian (Tamil) movie remake of this story, titled &quot;Kalaignan&quot; was shot in 1993.

June 12, 1919 – November 26, 2005) was the younger brother of [[Nathuram Godse]] and one of the conspirators in the [[assassination of Mahatma Gandhi]] on January 30, 1948. He was the last one to survive and lived his last days in [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

He worked as a volunteer for [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]. Simultaneously, he worked for the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] as well, but without enrolling as a member.

He joined Armed Forces (Indian Army Ordnance Corps) as storekeeper in 1940. When the World War II broke out, he opted for service on the front, and served in Iraq and Iran till year April 1944. After he returned, he was posted at Khadki and got married to Sindhu. They had two daughters, Vidyullata and Asilata. After Gopal was arrested in 1948, Sindhu-tai Godse supported her daughters by working in Gopal's elder brother Dattatraya's workshop called 'Udyam Engineering'. Later she set up a separate home and also started a small workshop of her own named 'Pratap Engineering'. Sindhutai Godse died in 2007, two years after Gopal Godse's death.

At the time of Gopal Godse's death in 2005, his daughter [[Himani Savarkar]] (née Asilata Godse) led a Hindu outfit from Pune. She died in 2015 after a long illness.

==Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi==
Gopal Godse's brother, [[Nathuram Godse]], shot Gandhi and was [[execution (legal)|executed]] by [[hanging]] with co-conspirator [[Narayan Apte]] on November 15, 1949. Gopal was arrested on 5 February from his house in Pune and was sentenced to 18 years for his part in the assassination. The three men believed that Gandhi had turned his back on the [[Indian Independence Movement]], and that his actions led to the [[Partition of India]] which in turn led to the inflammation of [[sectarian strife]] between [[Pakistan]]'s [[Muslim]]s and [[India]]'s [[Hindu]]s. In an interview in 1998 he reiterated that he never regretted Gandhi's killing. He hated what he called Gandhi's &quot;appeasement&quot; of Muslims.

According to Gopal what triggered the assassination was a bomb explosion on 20 January 1948 at Gandhi's prayer meeting in Delhi, just 50 meters away from Gandhi. The failed explosion for which [[Madan Lal Pahwa]] was caught, heightened the urgency-the Godse brothers wanted to finish it before the police caught them.

Gopal claimed that Gandhi never really said ''Hey Ram'' as he was dying and this was just a ploy of the government to prove that he was, indeed, a staunch Hindu who deserved to be elevated to sainthood. In an interview with Time Magazine he said, &quot;Someone asked me whether Gandhi said, ''Hey Ram''. I said [[Ben Kingsley|Kingsley]] did say it. But Gandhi did not. Because that was not a drama.&quot;

He admitted that at one point, Gandhi was his idol. He credited Gandhi for the mass awakening that he created and that he removed the fear of prison from the minds of Indians.

==Later life==
Godse was released from prison in October 1964, but was re-arrested a month later under the Defense of India Act and kept in prison for over a year. He was finally released at the end of 1965. Gopal Godse lived largely on the royalties obtained from books he wrote on Mahatma Gandhi and the assassination. He wrote nine books in Marathi and English.

'''Goran &quot;Majmun&quot; Vuković''' (1959 – 12 December 1994) was a [[Serbia]]n [[gangster]] who earned his nickname ''Majmun'' ('Monkey') due to his unique style of breaking into buildings: climbing and jumping balconies to enter a premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=606692|title=Kako kriminalci dobijaju nadimke|trans_title=How criminals got their nicknames|publisher=B92|date=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although he spent a considerable amount of time in [[Germany]], he is regarded as a member of the Voždovac gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:275867-Fama-zvana-Vozdovac|title=Fama zvana Voždovac|trans_title=Fame called &quot;Voždovac&quot;|publisher=Večernje Novosti|date=17 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He garnered notoriety in the killing of mobster [[Ljubomir Magaš]] (aka Ljuba Zemunac) in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]] on 10 November 1986, in front of the local courthouse. 

Magaš was unofficially proclaimed as the [[Capo di tutti capi|godfather]] of Serbian [[organized crime]] at the time. Vuković received a prison sentence of 5 years for the crime. He later returned to Belgrade.&lt;ref name=Vreme&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1060098|title=Eksplozivno leto i posledice|last=Švarm|first=Filip|publisher=[[Vreme]]|date=28 June 2012|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Belgrade in 1991, he survived five assassination attempts.&lt;ref name=Vreme/&gt; Such attempts included the bombing of his car as well as two policemen trying to kill him.{{cn|date=March 2016}} Due to this, he concluded that the Serbian secret police had a hit-list, and that Romeo Savić was murdered by said police. The reason for Savić's assassination (according to Vuković) is because Savić was openly talking about police drug dealers. Vuković was mentioned in [[Ratko Mladić]]'s personal diaries. Mladić wrote that Vuković and Duško Malović were involved in the 1994 murder of Serbian reporter [[Dada Vujasinović|Radislava Vujasinović]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

When he got back to Belgrade, he survived five murder attempts before getting murdered in December 1994.&lt;!-- by whom? --&gt; He was shot in his car near the [[Yugoslav Drama Theater]] building by three masked assassins, who appeared out of darkness of nearby [[Manjež]] park and opened continuous fire from automatic weapons. Vuković and his bodyguard Duško Malović were found dead.&lt;ref name=Vreme/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurir.rs/crna-hronika/gospodari-podzemlja-7-cuvenih-srpskih-kriminalaca-devedesetih-clanak-1928825|title=Masters of the underground: 7 most famous Serbian criminals of the 1990s|publisher=Kurir|date=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gordon Frederick Cummins was born in [[York]], [[England]], in early 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebmd.org.uk Births England and Wales 1837-1915]&lt;/ref&gt; He married a [[theatre producer]]'s secretary in 1936, and was a [[Leading aircraftman]] in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), where he was nicknamed ''The Count'' because of his claims to have [[Nobility|noble]] heritage.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt; Cummins had volunteered to retrain for aircrew duties and had been posted to the RAF ACRC (Aircrew Reception Centre) in [[Regents Park]], [[London]]. There, serving members of the RAF and new recruits were assessed for training, and this intake ran from 2 to 25 February when trainees were posted to ITW (Initial Training Wing) at home for three months ground training before commencing flying training, or to [[Blackpool]] prior to going overseas for training. At the time of his arrest, Cummins had neither a previous criminal record nor a known history of violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;SE001&quot;&gt;

== Murders ==
While in London for the Royal Air Force training course, Cummins took advantage of the city's night-time [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]] conditions to kill four women and [[Attempted murder|attempt to murder]] two others over six days in February 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN20176&quot; /&gt;

;Evelyn Hamilton
:On Sunday 9 February 1942, the body of 40-year-old pharmacist Evelyn Hamilton was discovered in an [[air raid shelter]] in [[Montagu Place]] in [[Marylebone]], where she had been strangled to death and her handbag stolen.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN20176&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt;

;Evelyn Oatley
:On Monday 10 February, the naked body of 35-year-old Evelyn Oatley (also known as Nita Ward) was discovered in her apartment on [[Wardour Street]]. Oatley had been strangled and her throat had been cut, and she had also been sexually [[mutilated]] with a can opener.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN20176&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt; Fingerprints found on the can opener confirmed earlier suspicions that the strangler was left-handed.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt;

;Margaret Lowe
:On Tuesday 11 February, a 43-year-old prostitute, Margaret Florence Lowe (also known as Pearl), was murdered in her apartment in Gosfield Street, Marylebone. She had been strangled with a silk stocking, and her body mutilated with a variety of implements including a razor blade, a knife and a candlestick. [[Bernard Spilsbury]], the [[pathologist]] examining Lowe's body, after seeing her injuries commented that they were &quot;quite dreadful&quot; and that the murderer was &quot;a savage sexual maniac&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt;

;Doris Jouannet
:On Wednesday 12 February 1942, 32-year-old Doris Jouannet (also known as Doris Robson) was murdered in the ground floor apartment that she shared with her husband. She had been strangled with a scarf and her naked body sexually mutilated in a similar fashion to the bodies of Oatley and Lowe the days before.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt; It was at this point the newspapers began to describe the killer as the Blackout Ripper, in reference to the similarities with [[Jack the Ripper]], a London [[serial killer]] who mutilated women victims.

;Greta Hayward
:On Friday 14 February 1942, Greta Hayward was attacked in a doorway near [[Piccadilly Circus]] by an unknown man in an RAF uniform whose sexual advances she reportedly had previously rejected. She managed to escape as her attacker was interrupted by the arrival of a delivery boy making his rounds, and the attacker then ran off.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt;

;Mrs. Mulcahy
:Shortly after the attack on Greta Hayward, a prostitute named Mrs. Mulcahy (also known as Kathleen King) was attacked by a customer in her flat near [[London Paddington station|Paddington Railway Station]]. She managed to fight off her attacker, who gave her an extra £5 before running off leaving his belt behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt;

== Arrest and trial ==
When the attacker of Greta Hayward was scared off by the arrival of a delivery boy, he had left behind his RAF-issued gas mask case.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN20176&quot; /&gt; The gas mask container had the service number 525987 on the side, identifying it as belonging to Cummins.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt; He was arrested on 16 February, two days after the last attack, and when his quarters were searched various items belonging to his victims were found.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt; His fingerprints were also found in two of the flats where the killings took place, and his fingerprints also matched those found on the can opener used to mutilate Evelyn Oatley.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SE001&quot; /&gt;

Cummins's trial for the murder of Evelyn Oatley began on 24 April 1942 at the [[Old Bailey]], with [[Denis Nowell Pritt]] [[King's Council|KC]], the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Hammersmith North]], acting in his defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times10June1942&quot; /&gt; However, due to a legal technicality, the trial had to be restarted with a new jury on 27 April, the defence now being undertaken by Mr J Flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Trial Reopened Before New Jury, R.A.F. Cadet Accused Of Four Murders  | work=The Times | date=28 April 1942 | url=https://login.thetimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Ftto%2Fkeywordsearch.arc | accessdate=17 September 2013 | location=London | pages=2 | issue=49221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence against Cummins was conclusive and, after a one-day trial, the jury took just 35 minutes to find him [[guilty plea|guilty]] of the four murders, and he was sentenced to [[death by hanging]]. An appeal in early June 1942 was dismissed, and he was executed by [[Albert Pierrepoint]] on 25 June 1942 at [[Wandsworth Prison]], during an [[The Blitz|air raid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SS001 &quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times10June1942&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Murder Appeal Dismissed | work=The Times | date=10 June 1942 | url=https://login.thetimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Ftto%2Fkeywordsearch.arc | accessdate=17 September 2013 | location=London | pages=2 | issue=49258}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Charges for the other three murders remained on the file, and [[Scotland Yard]] later claimed that Cummins had probably murdered two more women during air raids in London earlier in October 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;SE001&quot; /&gt; The foremost fingerprint expert of the day, [[Detective Chief Superintendent]] Frederick Cherrill, was instrumental in proving the case against Cummins.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN20176&quot; /&gt;

'''''Gore, Quebec''''' is a 2014 [[horror film]] directed by Jean Benoit Lauzon, and written by Rick Mele.

== Plot ==

A voiceover announces that the following footage was recovered from the camera of Dave Reynolds, who, in 2011, had left Ontario to spend a weekend in his parents' cottage in [[Gore, Quebec]] with his brother Sean, and their friends Katie, Brandon, Stacey, Colin, Erin, and Mike.

When Sean and Dave reach the cottage, they find a note informing them that the alarm was tripped a week ago, but that there were no signs of vandalism or theft; they also spot someone watching them from the woods, though Sean dismisses the observer as a neighbor or a hiker. Most of the others arrive, and mention that Brandon, Mike, and Mike's [[blind date]] Amanda should be there by tomorrow afternoon. A few hours into the group's partying, Katie stumbles into the cottage bleeding, followed by a man who attacks the others, and turns Dave's camera off. The film switches to a traditional third-person narrative, and shows the intruder breaking Erin's neck with an [[oar]].

The next day, Brandon, Mike, and Amanda drive to the cottage as a newscast announces that new DNA evidence has cast doubt on the guilt of Nick Gleason, who was convicted of five counts of first-degree murder in 2003. Upon reaching the cottage, Brandon goes for a walk, and Mike and Amanda go out on the boat, and discover Katie's body in the lake. Mike and Amanda go in search of Brandon, who has stumbled onto a series of abandoned structures, some of which are covered in [[graffiti]] that appears to have been drawn with blood. The killer mutilates and hangs Brandon, and uses his blood to add to the graffiti.

Elsewhere, the wounded Dave awakens in the woods, surrounded by the corpses of Erin and Sean, and runs off in search of aid, finding Mike and Amanda. Dave tells the two what happened to the others, and as they head back to the cottage, the killer throws an axe into Dave's back. The killer chases Amanda and Mike to where Colin and Stacey's remains are, and a flashback shows how he framed Nick Gleason for the five murders he committed in 2003.

Amanda and Mike reach the cottage, as does the killer, who axes a visiting neighbor. When the killer enters, Amanda bludgeons him with an oar, and she and Mike make a run for it, reaching Brandon's car, which they crash. The film returns to the &quot;[[found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]]&quot; format used at the beginning, with the killer using Dave's camera to film the posed bodies of his victims, and the captive Mike and Amanda.

== Reception ==

While ''[[Fangoria]]'s'' Chris Alexander said ''Gore, Quebec'' is &quot;as impoverished as they come, with a plot recycling just about every kids-in-the-woods horror [[Trope (literature)|trope]] known to man&quot; he admitted that the &quot;cheap charm is tempered by top notch craft and real, [[Independent film|indie]] energy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.fangoria.com/new/canadian-microbudget-slasher-gore-quebec-hits-dvd/|title = Canadian Microbudget Slasher ''Gore, Quebec'' Hits DVD|last = Alexander|first = Chris|publisher = ''Fangoria''|date = 13 October 2014|website = fangoria.com|accessdate = 13 December 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; In a review for ''Toronto Film Scene'', William Brownridge wrote, &quot;For $7000, this is pure indie filmmaking at its best. There's some great moments of horror, a couple of incredibly dark jokes, and an unsettling villain. It's not perfect, but is still one of the better indie horror films out there, and should be seen not only for the success of the film, but the success of the filmmaker for bringing it all together&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://thetfs.ca/2014/11/13/review-gore-quebec/#.VIzCILA5DIW|title = Review: ''Gore, Quebec''|last = Brownridge|first = William|publisher = ''Toronto Film Scene''|date = 13 November 2014|website = thetfs.ca|accessdate = 13 December 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Gormogon''' is a fictional character featured in a [[story arc]] of Season 3 of the [[Fox Network|FOX]] drama ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]''.

==Background and development==
The Gormogon was introduced as a [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]] in the third-season premiere, &quot;[[The Widow's Son in the Windshield]]&quot;, and has made appearances in the form of teeth marks on bones examined by the Jeffersonian scientists. He makes his first on-screen appearance in &quot;[[The Knight on the Grid]]&quot; (episode 8), although his former master, Arthur Graves, appears earlier in that episode, and his late [[apprentice]], Jason Harkness ([[Andrew James Allen]]), appeared in the season premiere. Before the season finale &quot;The Pain in the Heart&quot;, reviewers and fans speculated that the audience has actually already met him, perhaps being [[psychologist]] [[Lance Sweets|Dr. Lance Sweets]].&lt;ref&gt;http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2007/11/bones-mini-tv-1.html Will the real Gormogon please stand up?&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief was partially validated later in the season when the show's [[executive producer]], [[Hart Hanson]], stated in an interview with [[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]] suggested that either the Gormogon or his apprentice is someone the fans are fond of.  In the season finale, this statement is confirmed when [[Temperance Brennan (Bones)|Dr. Brennan]] finds that [[Zack Addy]] had lied about some of his earlier conclusions, leading [[Temperance Brennan (Bones)|Dr. Brennan]] and [[Seeley Booth|Agent Seeley Booth]] to realize that Zack must be the apprentice.  The team finally tracks down the Gormogon with the information provided by Zack as to the location of the Gormogon's home, and Booth kills him; he has not been given a name, and he has been described by Sweets as &quot;a nobody, an invisible man, angry at history for not seeing him&quot;. The [[stunt performer]] — Laurence Todd Rosenthal — who played the current (and presumably last) Gormogon, went uncredited; the character had no spoken dialogue and appeared on screen only briefly.

==Modus operandi==
When particles left on a victim's skull led [[Temperance Brennan (Bones)|Dr. Temperance Brennan]] and [[Seeley Booth]] to a [[bank vault|vault]] in an old bank, they discover tapestries, paintings, books, and other artifacts related to a number of mystical orders and traditions, including [[Kabbalah]], [[Freemasonry]], and [[Gnosticism]]. One of these tapestries included the imagery of the wolf, a symbol of freedom and power, which reflected in the killer's dentures, which were made exclusively with real canine teeth only (canines being symbolic of the wolf). The key feature of the vault is a silver skeleton arranged in a &quot;widow's son&quot; pose, a position known to the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] as one of sacrifice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Parts of the silver skeleton had been replaced with actual bone, which bear teeth marks from two different individuals, suggesting [[endocannibalism|ritualistic consumption of flesh]]. The vault also yields a tapestry whose pattern corresponds to specific locations in [[Washington, D.C.]] and to [[tarot cards]] showing different [[archetypes]], such as the Musician, the Bishop, and the Corruptor. The map provides a [[schematic]] for the Gormogon's activities, including the geographic location of the sculpture and of another, older sculpture and the residence of the Gormogon's old master, and the order of archetypes which are being integrated, via their bones, into the sculpture.

==Inspiration==
The [[Gormogons]] were an anti-[[Freemasonry|Masonic]] order of the 18th century. They are mentioned in scattered writings of the era, and accusations of association with them may have been used as a political weapon, as the very existence of the order involved a rejection of Masonic ideas.&lt;ref&gt;http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/gormogons.html The Gormogons&lt;/ref&gt; However, only the name has any relevance on the show, as [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Hodgins]] borrows it to refer to the killer for his dual reverence for and apparent dislike of secret societies and fraternal orders, including the [[Knights of Columbus]]. Hodgins' and Sweets' understanding of typical practices among orders, such as the master-apprentice relationship, ritualistic meals, and [[sacred geometry]] inform the ongoing investigation of the murders.

==Known victims==
Two skeleton sculptures have been found, one of which was constructed by Arthur Graves and the current Gormogon, the other by Jason Harkness and the current Gormogon. The former was completely made of bone, while the latter was still mostly [[silver]]. Not all the victims have yet been identified, but at least one bone in each sculpture was added for its significance to its owner. The three victims named below all lost their fathers at young ages, making them &quot;widows' sons&quot; and thus doubly symbolic as a sacrifice to the Gormogon. They were all involved with a trip to the Anatolian region of [[Turkey]], and associated with the [[Knights of Columbus]].
* Gavin Nichols, a violinist. His little finger, essential for his art, is added to the silver skeleton, and he corresponds to the Musician tarot card on the Gormogon's schematic.
* Father Douglas Cooper, a bishop. His kneecaps, essential in prayer, are added (by Brennan) to the silver skeleton, and he corresponds to the Bishop tarot card on the Gormogon's schematic.
* Mr. Porter, a lobbyist. As would be expected judging by his profession, his [[human mandible|mandible]], being a component associated with speech, is sent to Brennan. He corresponds to the Corruptor tarot card on the Gormogon's schematic.  When Dr. Addy is revealed as the current apprentice of the Gormogon, it is established that ''he'' had killed Porter.  Later on in the fourth season, it is revealed that Zack is, in fact, ''not'' the original killer, but an &quot;accessory&quot; to the killing. Porter's actual killer is the Gormogon's second apprentice, who the Gormogon had killed before recruiting Zack, contrary to Zack admitting to the murder in the season 3 finale.
* An unnamed [[SWAT]] officer, potentially. When Booth and SWAT stormed the Gormogon's home, he threw a knife into the officer's chest, apparently killing (or at least wounding) him.
* An unknown victim. When Booth and SWAT stormed the Gormogon's home, he was seen eating a piece of meat, which was most likely human. Zack told them that if they smelled meat cooking, it would mean the Gormogon had claimed another victim. The identity of this person has not been revealed.

==Related episodes==
* 3.01 – &quot;The Widow's Son in the Windshield&quot;
* 3.04 - &quot;The Secret in the Soil&quot; (Hodgins mentions 'German guy' responsible for 'Widow's Son killings' and Zack asks for more details)
* 3.06 – &quot;Intern in the Incinerator&quot; (mentioned as suspect, not responsible for killings)
* 3.08 – &quot;The Knight on the Grid&quot;
* 3.15 – &quot;The Pain in the Heart&quot;

'''''Gotham by Gaslight''''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] by [[Brian Augustyn]] and [[Mike Mignola]], with inks by [[P. Craig Russell]]. It spawned a sequel, '''''Master of the Future''''' (1991), also written by Augustyn, but with drawings by [[Eduardo Barreto]].

Although not originally labeled as such, ''Gotham by Gaslight'' is considered to be the first ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story, where DC Comics heroes are taken out of their usual setting and put into alternate timelines or realities. Subsequent printings have included the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; logo.

==Plot==
In 1889, [[Bruce Wayne]] is on a tour of [[Europe]]. His trip to Europe ends in [[Vienna]], where he has come to learn from [[Sigmund Freud|Dr. Freud]]. Bruce tells Freud that he has a recurring dream in which he recalls the murder of his parents and decides he must return to [[Gotham City]]. On the return trip, Bruce meets Jacob Packer, an old family friend who he calls Uncle Jake, who also returned from a trip to Europe.

Shortly after arriving, [[James Gordon (comics)|Inspector Gordon]] informs Wayne about criminal gangs currently operating in Gotham. Gordon also shows Bruce the case of a man who poisoned his wife and tried to commit [[suicide]] with the poison, which left him alive [[Joker (comics)|with a permanent grin]]. Bruce takes up the mantle of [[Batman]] to fight criminals on the street.

At the same time, a series of murders of women take place and some people begin to suspect that Batman is the murderer. It is soon discovered that [[Jack the Ripper]] has come to Gotham, as the murders in Gotham City seem to resemble the Ripper murders.

After a search of [[Wayne Manor]], a bloody knife is found under Bruce's bed and Bruce is arrested. A trial is held in which Uncle Jake is Bruce's defense attorney. After the trial, Bruce is convicted of being the Ripper and sentenced to be [[hanging|hanged]] for his crimes. Bruce is imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]].

Once in prison, Gordon gives Bruce all the documentation on the crimes. Bruce toils day and night to try to figure out how he can get the Ripper. Just one day before the execution, Bruce learns the identity of the Ripper by discovering he had the skill of a surgeon and used a knife that belonged to the medical group who worked with [[Thomas Wayne|his father]]. Bruce escapes from prison with the help of [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] and heads straight for the Ripper.

Batman interrupts the Ripper as he is about to claim his next victim. Batman chases the Ripper throughout Gotham and the two eventually come to a stop at the grave of [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]], where it is revealed that Jacob Packer is the Ripper. Packer had been trained in medicine and law with the money of Thomas Wayne, but he was driven insane by Martha Wayne's rejection of his advances. Since then he was killing women who resemble Martha to silence the laughter of Martha he heard in his head.

Packer reveals that he hired [[Joe Chill|an assassin]] to kill the Waynes. Gordon appears at this time with the police and Batman tells them to arrest Packer. Packer confesses that he is the Ripper and tries to kill Batman, but Gordon shoots Packer dead at the last minute. Batman disappears into the shadows, leaving Gordon to take in the body of Jack the Ripper.

===''Master of the Future''===
{{No plot|section|date=April 2015}}
In the sequel, set in 1892, Batman must battle [[Alexandre LeRoi]], who is seeking to disrupt Gotham's turn-of-the-century celebrations.

==Countdown==
{{Main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}
After the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] (whose estranged wife was revealed as the villain) spent DC's [[52 (comics)|missing year]] out of the limelight. In the weekly-sequel to the weekly event ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'', the [[Source Wall]] names Palmer as a key figure in impending [[DC Universe]] events. The search for Ray Palmer began in the [[Wildstorm Universe]], and soon crossed onto the [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#The 52|new 52 worlds]] created during the course of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

The first of these was called ''Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Gotham by Gaslight'' (January 2008) and was written by ''Gotham by Gaslight'''s original author, Brian Augustyn, relishing his chance to return to the world he had created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=006842 | first=Jennifer M. | last=Contino | title=Augustyn by Gaslight! Brian returns to Gotham | work=ComicCon.com | date=November 12, 2007 | accessdate=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story saw [[Monitors (comics)#&quot;Bob&quot;|Bob the Monitor]] accompany [[Jason Todd]], [[Donna Troy]], and [[Kyle Rayner]] (the latter three inhabitants of &quot;[[List of DC Multiverse worlds|New Earth]]&quot;) through the multiverse in search of multiuniversal counterparts to Ray Palmer. The group stopped on Earth-19, the Earth where the Batman of the earlier two ''Elseworlds'' storylines acted. There, they also encountered this Earth's counterpart of [[Blue Beetle]] and [[Man-Bat]] before they went to the next Earth for their continuing search.

Their search would take them to worlds populated by characters from other Elseworlds stories, including those seen in the ''[[Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain|Batman &amp; Dracula]]'' trilogy (Earth-43) and ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' (Earth-30).

==Publication history==
''Gotham by Gaslight'', the first official (although un-identified as such) [[Elseworlds]] publication, was initially released as a 52-page one-shot in February 1989. It was written by [[Brian Augustyn]] and pencilled by [[Mike Mignola]], with inks by [[P. Craig Russell]]. Two years later, the 68-page sequel ''Batman: Master of the Future'' — also written by Augustyn, but with drawings by [[Eduardo Barreto]] — was released, this time officially labelled an Elseworlds publication.

In 2006, in the wake of the DC event ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (which reshuffled the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]]), DC editorial allocated the ''Gotham by Gaslight'' world the label &quot;Earth-19&quot;. Prior to its appearance in ''Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Gotham by Gaslight'' (January 2008), the two one-shot issues were collected into one 112-page trade paperback volume (which was released under the same name, and with the same Mignola cover as the one-shot release).

===Collected editions===
The two stories have been collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]].

*''Gotham by Gaslight'', August 2006, DC Comics, ISBN 1-4012-1153-4 (Titan Books, ISBN 1-84576-403-X), collects:
**''Gotham by Gaslight'', 48 pages, DC Comics, November 1989, ISBN 0-930289-67-6 (Titan Books, December 1989, ISBN 1-85286-265-3)
**''Master of the Future'', 63 pages, DC Comics, December 1991, ISBN 1-56389-015-1

==Reception==
[[IGN]] Comics ranked ''Gotham by Gaslight'' #13 on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, saying that the comic is &quot;as taut and well-conceived a graphic novel as you can find — Elseworlds or otherwise.&quot; The website added, &quot;Quite simply, no other Elseworlds tale has managed such a brilliant concept nor executed it so perfectly.&quot; ''Gotham by Gaslight'' was not the highest-ranking Elseworlds story on the list, however, as ''[[Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain]]'' ranked higher at #9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624619p1.html | title=The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels | first=Hilary | last=Goldstein | work=[[IGN]] | date=June 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
=== Film ===
* In 2013, [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] producer James Tucker expressed his desire in make an animated film adaptation of ''Gotham by Gaslight''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toonzone.net/nycc-2013-justice-league-war-roundtable-interviews-jay-oliva-james-tucker-andrea-romano/&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Video games ===
* A video game based on the comic book was planned for release by [[Day 1 Studios]] (who also developed ''[[Fear 3]]'') however, after [[THQ]] failed to secure the rights to the property, the game was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/02/27/gotham-by-gaslight-video-shows-canceled-elseworlds-batman-game/ | title=Gotham By Gaslight Video Shows Canceled Elseworlds Batman Game | date=February 27, 2012 | accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The developers released some concept illustration which revealed the game had a steampunk feel to it while being set in [[Victorian England]] and also test footage was released which revealed the misty Gothic settings and the character model for [[Batman]]. Not much is known about the plot, though it could be assumed that it would be similar to the comic book storyline, with some added story elements. So far, reception to the leaked footage and concept illustration has been positive, with viewers praising the setting, the cape physics and the different approach the developers were trying to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cummins|first=Chris|title=This Gotham by Gaslight Game Looks Great, Doesn't Exist|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2012/02/this_gotham_by_gaslight_game_looks_great_doesnt_ex.php|publisher=Toplessrobot.com|accessdate=March 17, 2012|date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gothika''''' is a 2003 American [[psychological horror]] [[thriller film|thriller]] film directed by [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] and written by [[Sebastian Gutierrez]]. [[Halle Berry]] plays a [[psychiatrist]] in a women's mental hospital who wakes up one day to find herself on the other side of the bars, accused of having murdered her husband.

The film was first released on November 21, 2003 in the United States. At the time of its release, ''Gothika'' was the most successful film from [[Dark Castle Entertainment]] with $141.6 million.

==Plot==
Psychiatrist Dr. Miranda Grey ([[Halle Berry]]) who works at the Woodward Penitentiary For Women, has a car accident after trying to avoid a girl (Kathleen Mackey) on a road during a stormy night. She rushes to try to help the girl. The girl turns out to be a [[ghost]] and possesses Miranda's body. Miranda next wakes up in the very hospital she works for, but as a patient treated by her co-worker, Dr. Pete Graham ([[Robert Downey, Jr.]]). Drugged and confused, she remembers nothing of what happened after the car accident. To her horror, she learns that her husband Douglas ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) was brutally murdered and that she is the primary suspect. While Miranda copes with her new life in the hospital, the ghost uses her body to carry out messages (most noticeably, she carves the words &quot;Not Alone&quot; into Miranda's arm), which leads her former colleagues to believe Miranda is suicidal and is inflicting the wounds on herself.

Meanwhile, Miranda bonds with fellow inmate and former patient, Chloe Sava ([[Penélope Cruz]]). Several times in sessions, Chloe had claimed that she'd been raped while in the hospital, but Miranda had always attributed these stories to mental illness. One night, the door to Miranda's room in the hospital is opened by the ghost that has been haunting her. When she passes Chloe's room in the hospital, she can hear the rape occurring and momentarily sees a man's chest pressed against the window. The man's chest bears a tattoo of an [[Anima Sola]]. Miranda realizes that Chloe was not making up these stories and, when she sees Chloe the next day, she apologizes and the two embrace. Chloe warns Miranda that her attacker said he was going to target Miranda next. Miranda begins regaining some of her memories bit by bit and slowly comes to remember herself killing her husband. She realizes that the ghost had used her body to murder Douglas, thus making Miranda the patsy for his murder. This is why all of the physical evidence points to Miranda.

Miranda escapes from the hospital, having recognized the girl as a ghost. Seeking clues to the mystery of why she killed her husband, she goes to a farmhouse in Willow Creek, Rhode Island. In the cellar of the barn, she discovers a room containing a blood-stained bed, what appears to be a box containing drugs, restraints, and video equipment. She watches the tape that is still in the camera and the viewer hears a woman screaming as if tortured or raped. In the final seconds of the video, Douglas walks into the shot, covers a woman's lifeless body on the bed with a sheet, and winks at the camera. At this point, police arrive and one officer comes closer to Miranda and draws a gun on her while she is holding a knife to him. Miranda backs up to a staircase and, all of a sudden, an injured, frantically screaming girl grabs hold of her from the adjoining crawlspace. The police release the girl, and Miranda is taken to jail. While she is in jail, Sheriff Ryan ([[John Carroll Lynch]]), who was Douglas's closest friend, talks to Miranda and quizzes her on how she knew all these things. He does not believe her claim that ghosts told her everything and asks her what sort of person the accomplice would be. Miranda uses her experience as a psychiatrist to give a psychological profile, and as she does so, realizes that Ryan fits the profile perfectly. He attacks her and, in the fight, reveals his tattoo (an [[Anima Sola]]). Miranda kills the sheriff in an act of self-defense with the help of the ghost. Pete, just a few seconds later, shows up at the station, worried about Miranda's safety after he solves the mystery himself. He looks relieved to see Miranda safe and, through the soundproof window, mouths the words &quot;I'm sorry, Miranda.&quot;

Approximately a year later, Miranda is seen walking with Chloe on a city sidewalk, discussing how each helped the other come to terms with her experiences. Miranda claims to be free of the ghost's influence and sends Chloe off in a taxi. Miranda then sees a young boy standing in the middle of the road who appears as though he is about to be struck by a fire truck. Miranda yells for the boy to move but, after the fire truck passes through the boy without harming him, she realizes he was only a ghost. As Miranda walks away, a poster with the words &quot;Have you seen Tim?&quot; and a picture of the same boy is shown taped to a pole next to the street on which Miranda is walking.

'''Gottlieb Hering''' (2 June 1887 – 9 October 1945) was an ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' (captain) who served in [[Action T4]] and later as the second and last commandant of [[Bełżec extermination camp]] during [[Operation Reinhard]]. Hering directly perpetrated the [[genocide]] of [[Jews]] and other peoples during [[The Holocaust]].

==Life==
Hering was born and raised in Warmbronn, a district in the town of [[Leonberg]]. After finishing his schooling, Hering worked on a farm near his home.  From 1907 to 1909, he served in the [[20th (2nd Württemberg) Uhlans &quot;King William I&quot;]] regiment, and then voluntarily stayed on for another three years. Hering then joined the [[Heilbronn]] police in 1912.  In 1914, Hering married and had one son.

During the [[First World War]], Hering was called to serve in the machine gun company of Grenadier Regiment 123 in 1915, with which he fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern France until the armistice in 1918.  He attained the rank of sergeant.  For his war services he was awarded the [[Iron Cross First Class]]. After the First World War, Hering briefly rejoined the ''[[Schutzpolizei]]'' in Heilbronn.

==Police and SS careers==
Hering began his police career in 1919 as a detective (sergeant) in the criminal police (''[[Kriminalpolizei]]'', or ''Kripo'') in [[Göppingen]], near [[Stuttgart]], making officer rank by 1929.  In 1920, Hering had joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].  During the Weimar Republic era he initiated vigorous actions against the [[NSDAP]], SA and SS and consequently was called a &quot;Nazi-eater&quot;.  By the 1933 [[Nazi Seizure of Power]] (&quot;Machtergreifung&quot;), Nazi Party members vehemently demanded Hering's dismissal from the police.  However, Hering had known Nazi [[Christian Wirth]] from official contexts since 1912, and while working in the ''Kripo'' in Stuttgart, the two became acquaintances, so that Hering was able to continue working despite the violent protests of local [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[SS]] men.  In May 1933 Hering finally joined the NSDAP.  In 1934 he was appointed head of the Göppingen ''Kripo'' and then continued his career in 1939 in Stuttgart-Schwenningen.  After the outbreak of [[World War II]], Hering, along with other senior ''Kripo'' officers, was transferred to [[Gotenhafen]] ([[Gdynia]]) in December 1939.  He was appointed with the task of resettling [[Volksdeutsche]] to the [[General Government]].

==Action T4==
[[File:Gley and Hering drinking beer.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Oberscharführer (Staff Sergeant) Heinrich Gley and Hauptsturmführer (Captain) Gottlieb Hering drinking beer]]

Beginning in late 1940, Hering held various functions within the [[Action T4]] &quot;euthanasia&quot; program.  Having completed the order at Gdynia, he was transferred to work first at [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre]].  Hering served as an assistant supervisor (as did Fritz Tauscher) to a police officer by the name of Schemel.  After Sonnenstein, Hering became the office manager at [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]].&lt;ref name=Friedlander&gt;[[Henry Friedlander]] (1995). ''The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 206-207. ISBN 0-8078-2208-6&lt;/ref&gt;  He also worked in the special registry offices of [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre|Bernburg]] and [[Hadamar Euthanasia Centre|Hadamar]] euthanasia centres.

==Operation Reinhard==
After [[Action T4]], Hering was posted briefly to the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' in [[Prague]] in June 1942, and was then transferred to [[Operation Reinhard]] in [[Lublin]], Poland.  He replaced [[Christian Wirth]] as commandant of [[Bełżec extermination camp]] at the end of August 1942.  He served as the camp's commandant until its closure in {{Dts|1943|June|}}.  After [[Himmler]] was impressed by his visit to the Reinhard camps in March 1943, Hering was promoted to the rank of ''[[SS]]-[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' (captain).&lt;ref&gt;[[Yitzhak Arad]] (1987). ''[http://books.google.ca/books?id=YglnAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Hering+Poniatowa  Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps]'', Bloomington: Indiana University Press, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; ''SS-[[Scharführer]]'' Heinrich Unverhau, who served at Bełżec, testified about him: &quot;Hering and [[Christian Wirth|Wirth]] were definitely wicked people, and the whole staff of the camp was afraid of them.... I heard that Hering shot two Ukrainian guards who expressed their dissatisfaction with what was going on in Belzec.&quot;&lt;ref name=Arad&gt;[[Yitzhak Arad]] (1987). ''Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps'', Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 187-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Reder]], one of the very few survivors of Bełżec, wrote of Hering's role in the killing of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phdn.org/archives/holocaust-info.dk/belzec/imgs_belzec/hering.htm  Rudolf Reder on Gottlieb Hering. Citation.] Arad 1987, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|He was a tall bully, broad shouldered, age around forty, with an expressionless face. He seemed to me as if he were a born bandit. Once, the gassing engine stopped working.  When he was informed [about it], he arrived astride a horse, ordered the engine to be repaired and did not allow the people in the gas chambers to be removed.  He let them strangle and die slowly for a few hours more.  He yelled and shook with rage.  In spite of the fact that he came only on rare occasions, the SS men feared him greatly.  He lived alone, attended by Ukrainian orderly who served under him.  This Ukrainian submitted to him the daily reports.&lt;ref name=Arad/&gt;}}

Tadeusz Misiewicz, a Pole who lived in the village of [[Bełżec]] and worked at the train station, testified about Hering (file No.: Ds. 1604/45 - [[Zamość]]. Dated 15 October 1945 / Belzec-OKBZ):

{{quote|Once the major {{sic}}, the commander of Belzec death camp, invented a new type of entertainment: he tied a Jew with a rope to his car; the Jew was forced to run behind the car and behind them ran the major's dog and bit the Jew.  The major rode from the camp to the water pump, which was in Belzec on Tomaszowska Street, and back.  What happened to this Jew I do not know.  This event was witnessed by the people of Belzec.&lt;ref name=Arad/&gt;}}

==After Operation Reinhard==
After the termination of [[Operation Reinhard]] and the closure of [[Belzec]] in June 1943, Hering remained the commander of the [[Poniatowa concentration camp]] reassigned as subcamp of [[Majdanek]] from the forced labor camp supporting the German war effort.  On 3–4 November 1943, German police killed the remaining Jews at Poniatowa during [[Aktion Erntefest]] ({{lang-de|Operation Harvest Festival}}).  Hering then joined fellow SS men from the Operation Reinhard staff in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yitzhak Arad]] (1987). ''[http://books.google.ca/books?id=YglnAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Hering+Poniatowa Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps]'', Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 371-372&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 1945, Gottlieb Hering died of mysterious complications in the waiting room of St. Catherine's Hospital in [[Kernen|Stetten im Remstal]].&lt;ref name=Klee&gt;[[Ernst Klee|Klee, Ernst]], Dressen, Willi, Riess, Volker (1991).

'''Gottlob Christian Berger''' (16 July 1896&amp;nbsp;– 5 January 1975) was a senior [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] official who held the rank of ''[[Obergruppenführer|SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS]]'' (lieutenant general), and was the chief of the [[SS Main Office]] responsible for ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) recruiting during [[World War II]]. Serving in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] during [[World War I]], he was wounded four times and awarded the [[Iron Cross]] First Class. Immediately after the war, he was a leader of the ''[[Militia#Germany|Einwohnerwehr]]'' militia in his native [[Kingdom of Württemberg|North Württemberg]]. He joined the Nazi Party in 1922, but lost interest in right-wing politics during the 1920s, training and working as a physical education teacher.

In the late 1920s, he rejoined the Nazi Party and became a member of the paramilitary ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) in 1931. He clashed with other leaders of the SA, and joined the ''[[Allgemeine-SS]]'' in 1936. Initially responsible for physical education in an SS region, he was soon transferred to the staff of ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] as head of the sports office. In 1938, he was appointed as head of the recruiting office of the SS Main Office (SS-HA), taking over as chief of the SS-HA the following year. To a significant extent, Berger was the &quot;father&quot; of the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'', as he not only implemented recruiting structures and policies that assisted the ''Waffen-SS'' to circumvent [[Wehrmacht]] controls over conscription, but also extended ''Waffen-SS'' recruiting first to &quot;Germanic&quot; volunteers from [[Scandinavia]] and western Europe, then ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' (ethnic Germans) outside the Reich, and finally to peoples who in no way reflected Himmler's ideas of &quot;racial purity&quot;. He consistently advocated greater ideological training for the ''Waffen-SS'', but did not view SS ideology as a replacement for religion. He also sponsored and protected his friend [[Oskar Dirlewanger]], whom he placed in command of a unit of convicted criminals; the SS-''[[Sonderkommando Dirlewanger]]'' subsequently committed many war crimes. Berger often clashed with senior officers of the Wehrmacht and even with senior ''Waffen-SS'' officers over his recruiting methods, but he took advantage of opportunities as they presented themselves in order to grow the ''Waffen-SS'' to a total of 38 [[division (military)|divisions]] by war's end.

Berger undertook several other roles in the latter stages of the war, while continuing as chief of the SS-HA. He had a key role in the  [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] from mid-1942, allowing the SS to direct much of the economic activity in the east. In this role he proposed a plan to kidnap and enslave 50,000 Eastern European children between the ages of 10 and 14, under the codename ''[[Heuaktion]]'', a plan that was subsequently carried out. In response to the [[Slovak National Uprising]] in August 1944, Berger was appointed as Military Commander in [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovakia]], and was in charge during the initial failure to suppress the revolt. The following month he was appointed as one of the two chiefs of staff of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' militia, and as chief of the [[prisoner of war]] camps. In the final months of the war he commanded German forces in the [[Bavarian Alps]], which included remnants of several of the ''Waffen-SS'' units he had helped recruit. He surrendered to U.S. troops near [[Berchtesgaden]], and was promptly arrested. He was tried and convicted in the [[Ministries Trial]] of the U.S. [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg Military Tribunals]] for [[war crime]]s, and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. His sentence was soon reduced to 10 years, and he was released after serving six and a half years. After release he advocated for the rehabilitation of the ''Waffen-SS'' and worked in several manufacturing businesses. He died in his hometown in 1975.

Described as blustery, cynical, and &quot;one of Himmler's most competent and trusted war-time lieutenants&quot;, Berger was also an ardent [[Antisemitism|anti-Semite]] and a skilled and unscrupulous bureaucratic manipulator. Due to his organisational and recruiting skills, Berger was kept as the chief of the SS-HA throughout the war.

==Early life and involvement with Nazi Party==
Berger was born on 16 July 1896 at [[Gerstetten]] in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]],{{sfn|LBW|2015}} the son of saw-mill owners Johannes and Christine ({{Nee|Moser}}),{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} and was one of eight children.{{sfn|Rempel|1989|p=35}} He attended ''[[Volksschule]]'' (elementary school) and ''[[Realschule]]'' (junior high school) and then teacher training in [[Nürtingen]].{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} He volunteered for military service at the beginning of [[World War I]], and rose to the rank of ''[[Leutnant]]'' in the infantry by the time of his discharge in 1919.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=246–247}} Wounded four times,{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}} he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] First Class,{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=246–247}} and was considered 70 per cent disabled at the time of his discharge.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}} During the war, all three of his brothers died, two killed in action and the other executed as a spy in the United States.{{sfn|Trigg|2012|p=34}} Berger's combative temperament and very conservative politics fitted him for a leadership role with the North Württemberg ''[[Militia#Germany|Einwohnerwehr]]'' militia in 1918–19. He married Maria ({{Nee|Dambach}}) in 1921.{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} After joining the [[Nazi Party]] in 1922, he was arrested and briefly held in custody after [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Munich]] [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in November 1923. He trained and worked as a physical education teacher, despite his injuries, and lost interest in politics for some years,{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}} before rejoining the Nazi Party in 1929,{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} and the paramilitary ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) in January 1931.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}}

Berger's SA career was limited by his soldierly ideas of politics and leadership, but after the [[Nazi Seizure of Power|Nazi seizure of power]] in January 1933, he was found to be very suitable to lead ''[[Protective custody#Nazi Germany|Schutzhaft]]'' operations, which involved the rounding up of [[Jews]] and &quot;political undesirables&quot;. In April 1933, his clashes with younger leaders meant his SA career had met a dead-end.{{sfn|LBW|2015}} His SA peers criticised Berger's ambitious nature, outspokenness and lack of self-reflection. Beginning in July 1934, Berger worked with the SA training chief '' SA-Obergruppenführer'' [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger]].{{sfn|Rempel|1989|p=35}} Between 1933 and 1935, he was a school inspector in [[Esslingen am Neckar]] near [[Stuttgart]],{{sfn|LBW|2015}} and in 1935 was a senior official in the [[Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|Gau Württemberg&amp;nbsp;– Hohenzollern]] Ministry of Culture. He was recruited into the ''[[Allgemeine SS]]'' by ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1936,{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}} on Krüger's recommendation.{{sfn|Rempel|1989|p=35}} Initially appointed to oversee sports and physical training for ''[[Units and commands of the Schutzstaffel#Allgemeine-SS commands|SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest]]'' (SS Regional Headquarters Southwest), he then moved to Himmler's [[Persönlicher Stab Reichsführer-SS|personal staff]] as head of the sports office.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}}

Berger interceded on behalf of his World War I comrade [[Oskar Dirlewanger]],{{sfn|Reitlinger|1957|p=172}}{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=128}} who had been imprisoned for two years in 1935 for offences against a minor.{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=268}} On his release from prison, Berger used his influence to ensure Dirlewanger could join the [[Condor Legion]] and fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Maguire|2013|pp=128 &amp; 268}}

On 1 July 1938, Himmler appointed Berger as chief of the recruiting department of the ''[[SS-Hauptamt]]'' (SS Main Office, or SS-HA), which he quickly developed into a powerful tool for Himmler's ambitions.{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} According to Berger, the German Army was initially dismissive of the idea of SS combat troops. He quoted the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Commander-in-Chief of the Army]], ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Werner von Fritsch]] as saying, &quot;If the Reich Transport Minister has his militarily-trained Railway Police, why shouldn't Himmler also play at soldiers?&quot;{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=199}}

Berger later claimed that he had come up with the idea of SS combat troops wearing camouflage jackets from his own hunting days, and had suggested it to ''SS-Obergruppenführer'' [[Sepp Dietrich]], commander of the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment]] (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of ''[[Flecktarn]]'' camouflage were issued. The author [[Adrian Weale]] doubts Berger's account.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=215}}

Berger had achieved the rank of ''[[Major|Major der Reserve]]'' in the [[Wehrmacht]] by 1938, but his initial rank upon joining the ''Allgemeine SS'' was ''SS-[[Standartenführer]]'', based upon his SA service.{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=246–247}} Berger played a key role in directing the [[fifth column]] ''[[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]]'' during the [[Sudetenland#Sudeten Crisis|Sudeten Crisis]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938,{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=163}} and the organisational skills he displayed there marked him as highly suitable for the SS recruiting role.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=36}}

==Chief of the ''SS-Hauptamt''==

===1939–40===

====Initial expansion of the ''Waffen-SS''====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-160-13A, Theodor Eicke.jpg|thumb|200px|The Inspector of Concentration Camps, ''SS-Gruppenführer'' Theodor Eicke was appointed to command the new ''SS-Division-Totenkopf'', which was formed using personnel from the SS-TV|alt=a black and white photograph of Theodor Eicke in SS dress uniform]]
Prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], the SS-HA had been responsible for organising an erstwhile &quot;civilian&quot; political organisation, the ''Allgemeine SS''. After the war began, it was clear that those departments of the SS-HA looking after the ''[[SS-Verfügungstruppe]]'' (SS dispositional troops or SS-VT) had performed poorly. During the [[invasion of Poland]], deficiencies in organisation, equipment and training had become obvious. The SS-HA, and specifically its chief, ''SS-[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[August Heissmeyer]], were held responsible, and Heissmeyer soon made way for Berger.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=117–118}} As head of recruiting, Berger had already unified the recruiting system for the three main SS organisations, the ''Allgemeine SS'', SS-VT and police,{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=170}} and in August 1938 he negotiated a recruiting agreement between Himmler and the ''[[Reichsjugendführer]]'' (Reich Youth Leader) [[Baldur von Schirach]] which created a strong recruiting pathway for the young men of the [[Hitler Youth]] into the SS.{{sfn|Rempel|1989|p=36}}

Following the Polish campaign, Hitler approved the expansion of the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up to the strength of a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned [[Battle of France|invasion of France and the Low Countries]], Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=32}} To do this, he circumvented the recruiting primacy of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler's control, the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Order Police or Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the ''[[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|SS-Verfügungs-Division]]'' (later given the name ''Reich'' and then ''Das Reich'') commanded by the Inspector of the SS-VT, ''SS-Gruppenführer'' [[Paul Hausser]]; the ''[[3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf|SS-Division-Totenkopf]]'' commanded by the Inspector of Concentration Camps, ''SS-Gruppenführer'' [[Theodor Eicke]]; and the ''[[4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division|Polizei-Division]]'', commanded by ''SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei'' [[Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch]].{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=248–249}} This rapid transformation was theoretical to a significant extent, as Eicke and the SS-TV continued to resist exchanges of personnel with the SS-VT.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|pp=189–190}}

The fact that Berger was able to expand the SS combat troops so quickly was a tribute to his improvisational skills.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=124}} On 1 December 1939, Himmler promoted Berger to chief of the SS-HA.{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} To a significant extent, Berger was the &quot;father&quot; of the [[Waffen-SS|''Waffen''-SS]] (or Armed SS),{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=248}} a term he coined in an agreement dated 2 March 1940.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=48}} He used the new term to smooth over friction between the SS-VT and SS-TV, as they were combined in new formations.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=249}} Berger's new-found authority for SS recruiting matters irritated the chiefs of the ''Allgemeine SS'' districts, who had previously been responsible for this function. This came to a head when the chief of ''SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest'', ''SS-Gruppenführer'' [[Kurt Kaul]] refused to recognise Berger's delegate in his district, referring to Berger as a &quot;low-ranking empire builder&quot;.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=37}} Kaul's series of letters to Berlin came to nothing, as the power and influence of the ''Allgemeine SS'' had waned with the outbreak of war and the conscription of many of its members into the Wehrmacht, ''Waffen-SS'' and police. Ultimately, when Kaul threatened to arrest Berger's delegate in ''SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest'', Himmler intervened personally in February 1940, stating that &quot;the most unpleasant consequences&quot; would befall Kaul if he did not throw his support behind Berger and his recruiting organisation. Kaul acquiesced, and Berger's supremacy as SS recruiting supremo was firmly established.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=37–38}}

====The first &quot;Germanic&quot; recruits====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Weill-096-27, Deutschland, Vereidigung von Dänen.jpg|thumb|left|Danish recruits joining the ''Waffen''-SS in 1941|alt=a black and white photograph of soldiers performing the &quot;Hitler salute&quot; beneath a Danish flag]]
Despite this success, Berger still had to negotiate with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the ''Waffen-SS'' at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by ''Generaloberst'' [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Chief of ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) on a number of issues around ''Waffen-SS'' recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=38–41}} On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to ''SS-[[Brigadeführer]]''.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}} According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the ''Waffen-SS'' would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=199}} Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it did not want to see any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=256–257}}

By this time, the ''Waffen-SS'' numbered just under 125,000, of whom more than 40,000 originated from [[Austria in the time of National Socialism|post-Anschluss Austria]] and other areas outside the pre-1933 borders of Germany.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=263}} In April 1940, the Germans had [[Operation Weserübung|invaded]] and occupied Denmark and Norway, opening up a source of &quot;Nordic&quot; or &quot;Germanic&quot; recruits, which Berger was quick to exploit. After the invasion of France and the Low Countries, the resulting regiment, ''SS-Nordland'', was joined by a Dutch-Belgian-Flemish regiment, ''SS-Westland''.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=266–267}} At the same time as they were recruiting for these &quot;Germanic&quot; regiments, Berger's delegates were also focusing on gaining ethnic German volunteers from outside the Reich, men not subject to the Wehrmacht-controlled draft. In May, more than 1,000 [[Germans of Romania|Romanian ''Volksdeutsche'']] had been recruited,{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=94}} with the help of Andreas Schmidt, Berger's son-in-law and the political leader of the Romanian ''Volksdeutsche''.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=169}} Three weeks after the invasion of Belgium, Berger was appointed as the president of the German-sponsored pro-Nazi Belgian political party, ''[[Devlag|DeVlag]]''. Berger also worked to bring the [[Germans of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav ''Volksdeutsche'']] under the influence of the SS, which he was able to achieve six months prior to the invasion of that country by the Axis in April 1941.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=42}} Berger's recruiting work with the Flemish and Croatian communities was facilitated by his chairmanship of both the ''Deutsche-Flämischen Studiengruppe'' (German-Flemish Studies Group) and the ''Deutsche-Kroatischen Gesellschaft'' (German-Croatian Society).{{sfn|Trigg|2012|p=34}}

====Friction with the Wehrmacht====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-033-01, Alfred Jodl.jpg|thumb|''Generalmajor'' Alfred Jodl took a dim view of Berger's diversion of potential Wehrmacht recruits to the SS|alt=a black and white portrait of Alfred Jodl in German Army dress uniform]]
By the end of May 1940, Berger had filled the authorised quota of new recruits, but his recruiters kept signing up young men to create a reserve that could replace the many older ''Allgemeine SS'' reservists in the three field divisions. To supplement this pool, Berger also continued recruiting for the SS-TV and police regiments, which were not under Wehrmacht control, and were still below the strengths approved by Hitler. This continued to create friction between the Wehrmacht and SS, as potential Wehrmacht recruits were siphoned off to forces under Himmler's control. By a range of methods, Berger diverted manpower from the younger age groups, and also targeted areas outside the Reich that were not subject to Wehrmacht recruiting controls.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=93–94}}

Berger's evasion of Wehrmacht-imposed recruiting restrictions came to a head in June, when the Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Alfred Jodl]] initiated an investigation of SS recruiting operations within the Reich. The result was that around 15,000 SS inductions were held up by various Wehrmacht military district headquarters. Berger became aware of Jodl's inquiry and advised Himmler that even their inquiries had underestimated his success, giving the example that the Wehrmacht believed he had exceeded the June quota for ''SS-Division-Totenkopf'' by 900 men, when in fact the true figure was 1,164. He boasted to Himmler that during the whole recruiting campaign, he had signed up 15,000 men for ''SS-Division-Totenkopf'', when Hitler had only authorised the recruiting of 4,000 for the division in the same period. To justify his actions, Berger pointed to the fact that, just before the French surrender, Hitler had ordered the release of over-age SS reservists. In the ''SS-Division-Totenkopf'', this meant 13,246 of the 20,000-strong formation.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=95–96}}

Berger had been remarkably successful, despite the obstacles placed in his path by the Wehrmacht, having recruited nearly 60,000 men for the ''Waffen-SS'' between mid-January and the end of June. These fresh troops were more than sufficient to replace those released when Himmler demobilised several categories of SS reservists in late July. But Himmler knew that the future of the ''Waffen-SS'' was assured; Hitler was already considering invading the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=97–98}}

====Re-organisation====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Moebius-146-06, Russland, Heinrich Himmler bei Frontbesuch.jpg|thumb|left|Himmler inspecting the ''SS-Division Wiking'' in September 1942. The &quot;Germanic&quot; regiments ''SS-Nordland'' and ''SS-Westland'' had been used to help form the division at the end of 1940.|alt=a black and white photograph of a bespectacled Heinrich Himmler in uniform walking along a line of soldiers in Waffen-SS uniform]]
In August 1940, Berger reorganised the SS-HA to focus better on its main role of recruiting for the ''Waffen-SS'', creating separate sections to deal with recruiting inside and outside the Reich.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=118–119}} The section targeting recruits from outside of the Reich developed out of a briefing he received from the Chief of the ''[[SS Führungshauptamt|SS-Führungshauptamt]]'' (SS Command Main Office, or SS-FHA) ''SS-Brigadeführer'' [[Hans Jüttner]] on Hitler's expectations of the ''Waffen-SS'' for the upcoming [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], which included the raising of a fourth division and the expansion of the LSSAH to a motorised brigade. Berger realised that the Wehrmacht quotas for the ''Waffen-SS'' would fall short of its manpower needs by at least 6,000 per year.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=99–101}}

Berger's SS-HA had a problematic relationship with the SS-FHA, which was responsible for organising, training and equipping the ''Waffen-SS''. The SS-FHA wanted the ''Waffen-SS'' to be a small elite corps, but Berger and Himmler knew that Hitler needed as many divisions as possible, even if that meant some ''Waffen-SS'' formations would be of lesser quality.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=118–119}} Jüttner's initial efforts at integrating the recruits from western Europe and Scandinavia were inadequate, with insufficient emphasis on training and appointing officers and non-commissioned officers from the ranks of the new recruits. The SS-FHA had also paid scant attention to retention of ranks for former members of national armed forces, liaison with home territories, and even mail. Berger's well-researched report to Himmler on these failures was damning, and the ''Reichsführer-SS'' soon issued detailed instructions on the handling of these new recruits, from the moment they joined the ''Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Trigg|2012|p=145}} Berger's criticisms of Jüttner must be seen in the light of the advantages Berger considered he would achieve if Jüttner's position with Himmler was weakened.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=300}} 

One of the obvious sources for ''Waffen-SS'' manpower was the nearly 40,000 troops of the SS-TV regiments, which consisted of youths below conscription age for the Wehrmacht, as well as older ''Allgemeine SS'' reservists. These regiments were under Himmler's control, and were deployed across German-occupied Europe as political police, but the security functions they carried out were clearly within the capabilities of the Orpo.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=102}} In late 1940, in order to ensure that Himmler's instructions were carried out,  Berger established a special camp at [[Cernay, Haut-Rhin|Sennheim]] in occupied [[Alsace]], where non-Reich German recruits could be brought up to physical standards and ideologically indoctrinated prior to ''Waffen-SS'' training. This was an attempt to address the concerns of some commanders about the quality of these recruits, and their ability to be integrated into units composed mostly of Reich Germans. Recruits sent to this camp included ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' (ethnic Germans from outside the Reich), [[Danes]], [[Norwegians]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemings]]. Berger also created a network of offices throughout German-occupied Europe to ensure the welfare of the families of such recruits, influence the local communities to support ''Waffen-SS'' recruiting, and prepare potential recruits for indoctrination. This network and its activities was strongly resisted by the [[Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle|Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans]] ({{lang-de|Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle}} or VoMi) the Nazi Party arm responsible for guiding the ethnic German communities outside the Reich. Himmler, unhappy with the work of VoMi in supporting SS recruiting, did not abolish VoMi, he just authorised Berger to circumvent it.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=217–218}}

By the end of 1940, ''SS-Nordland'' and ''SS-Westland'' had become the basis for the formation of the fourth division, ''SS-Division Wiking''.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=269}} Casting about for another source of recruits, Berger struck upon the idea of enlisting convicted criminals, who were concentrated in the ''[[36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS|Sonderkommando Dirlewanger]]'', commanded by Berger's friend, Dirlewanger.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=270–275}} Dirlewanger had returned from Spain and been reinstated as a ''SS-Standartenfuhrer der Reserve'' in the ''Allgemeine SS'' at Berger's instigation.{{sfn|Maguire|2013|pp=128 &amp; 268}} In September 1940, Dirlewanger's unit had been deployed to the area of [[General Government|occupied Poland]], where they established defensive positions and provided guards for a Jewish labour camp.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1957|p=172}}

===1941===
In March 1941, Berger founded the [[Germanische Leitstelle|German Guidance Office]] which was responsible for the recruitment of &quot;Germanic&quot; men for the ''Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=212}} The German Guidance Office encompassed the camp at Sennheim, as well as the network of recruiting offices already established throughout occupied Europe, and became a separate department of the SS-HA, with separate sections for leadership, recruiting and education, and six regional sub-sections.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=218}}

After the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] of April 1941, the LSSAH was expanded to divisional strength, and following the commencement of the invasion of the Soviet Union commenced, a sixth ''Waffen-SS'' division, [[6th SS Mountain Division Nord|''SS-Division Nord'']] was formed from four of the former &quot;SS-Totenkopf&quot; regiments, all of which had been re-designated &quot;SS Infantry&quot; regiments. These new divisions had an initial strength only two-thirds of that of the original divisions. The ''Polizei-Division'' was also renamed the ''SS-Polizei-Division''. The expectations on Berger's recruiting network continued to increase, just as casualties began to mount in earnest.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=120}}

====The West Europeans====
In early April 1941, Hitler had agreed to the creation of the ''SS-Freiwilligenstandarte Nordwest'' (SS Volunteer Regiment Northwest), with an authorised strength of 2,500 men recruited from Flanders and the Netherlands. This formation capitalised on the push for an autonomous [[Greater Netherlands|Flemish-Dutch region]] within the Reich. Significant proponents of such a union were [[Anton Mussert]] of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] and [[Staf De Clercq]] of the [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond|Flemish National League]]. In this, Berger was exploiting Mussert and De Clerq, because he was actually working towards Hitler's idea of incorporating Flanders and Wallonia into the Reich as two ''Gaue'', not a unified autonomous entity.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=150}}

At the end of April, Himmler ordered Berger to obtain 20,000 new recruits for the ''Waffen-SS'' by the end of May. With Hitler's authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free hand for a limited time. He did not disappoint, misleading the new recruits as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the ''Allgemeine SS'' and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the ''Waffen-SS'' in this period, and they were sent to join the ''SS-Division-Wiking''.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=151–152}}

====The &quot;national legions&quot;====
In June 1941, just after the commencement of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler decreed that the ''Waffen-SS'' could recruit foreigners for service on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=303}} He wanted a legion to be raised from each of the occupied countries of Western Europe, but Himmler was only interested in recruiting &quot;Germanic&quot; people into the ''Waffen-SS''. Himmler decided that there were large numbers of potential pro-German but nationalistic recruits available from the &quot;Germanic&quot; races in occupied countries, and directed Berger to explore this manpower source. As a result of Himmler's decision, the Wehrmacht was permitted to recruit Frenchmen, Spaniards and Croats, while Dutch, Flemish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish men were Berger's domain.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=152–153}} The &quot;national legions&quot; each numbered 1,000, except the Netherlands Legion, which had a maximum strength of 2,000.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=303}} In November 1941, the Netherlands Legion and Flemish Legion had completed light infantry training and were sent to join the [[2nd SS Infantry Brigade]] on the [[Leningrad Front]]. While they swore a personal oath to Hitler and were subject to SS rules and regulations, they were not members of the SS, and wore national symbols place of the [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|sig rune]]s.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=154–155}} Berger even went so far as to recommend to Himmler that Flemings no longer be treated as foreigners, but be given full citizenship rights as Germans.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=336}}

The idea of having &quot;national legions&quot; was poorly managed, with some recruits being tricked into enlisting, and many of the new recruits being badly treated by their German instructors. Once news of this reached their home territories, the limited flow of pro-German volunteers dried up.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=154–155}} Once recruited, the SS-FHA failed to carry through the commitments made to the men of the &quot;national legions&quot; when they enlisted, and combined with mistreatment and abuse from their German [[en cadre|cadre]] staff and instructors, this had a negative impact on morale and the willingness of more men to volunteer. This was something from which the &quot;national legions&quot; never fully recovered, despite Himmler's intervention at Berger's behest.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=160–162}} However, due to the expansion of SS recruiting rights in areas outside the Reich and the failure of the Wehrmacht to capitalise on recruiting opportunities afforded them, several of the &quot;national legions&quot; recruited by the Wehrmacht were eventually transferred to the ''Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|pp=334–335}}

====A ''Volksdeutsche'' division====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-169-0915-24, Jugoslawien, Rastplatz deutscher LKW und Panzer H39.jpg|thumb|The 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division ''Prinz Eugen'' camped on the outskirts of a Bosnian town|alt=a black and white photograph of German armoured vehicles and tents in a square formation in open country]]
Encouraged by the success he had achieved in Romania in 1940 with the help of his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the ''Volksdeutsche'' communities of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little could be done to further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time [[invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia had been overrun]] by the [[Axis powers|Axis]], and Romania and Hungary had joined the pact.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=168–169}} Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav ''Volksdeutsche'' into his renamed ''SS-Division-Reich'', even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=150}} On his way back to Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through Romania and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=169}}

Not content with this fairly minor and surreptitious recruiting effort, Berger proposed to raise a seventh ''Waffen-SS'' division from the ethnic Germans of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=217}} By the end of 1941, faced with the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]]-led uprising in Yugoslavia, Hitler authorised the raising of the ''[[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|SS-Freiwilligen-Division Prinz Eugen]]''. It was to be the first of the many &quot;foreign&quot; divisions that would dramatically change the composition of the ''Waffen-SS'' during the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=169–170}} The division was formed around an existing SS-controlled ''Selbstschutz'' (militia) drawn from ethnic Germans in the [[Banat (1941–44)|Banat]], but Berger had misread the willingness of the local ethnic German  population to volunteer for service outside their homeland. His recruiters initially struggled to attract volunteers, so coercion was applied, and ultimately, the Banat was declared to be under German sovereignty, and Himmler approved conscription on the basis of an archaic law, the ''Tiroler Landsturmordnung'' ([[County of Tyrol|Tyrolean]] General Levy Act) of 1872.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=170–172}}

===1942===
On 29 January 1942, Himmler issued an order which re-titled Dirlewanger's unit as ''SS-Sonderkommando Dirlewanger'', and formally incorporated it into the ''Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=267}} Later that year,  when an SS judge issued an arrest warrant for Dirlewanger in response to his unit's anti-partisan operations, the SS-HA chief intervened with Himmler saying, &quot;Better to shoot two Poles too many than one too few. A savage country cannot be governed in a decent manner.&quot;{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=128}}

====Baltic Legions====
Within a few weeks of the invasion of the Soviet Union, Berger's teams had begun recruiting Baltic volunteers for SS police units, forming several security battalions of Latvian and Estonian volunteers. The Wehrmacht also recruited eight Estonian battalions. This split approach to recruiting in the Baltic region continued into 1942, with some units being decimated in front line fighting. In May of that year, Berger decided to exploit the nationalists within the Baltic states in order to gain access to recruits for the ''Waffen-SS''. Himmler was lukewarm on his initial proposal, but as casualties started to mount in 1942, he changed his mind, and approved the formation of a ''Waffen-SS'' [[Estonian Legion]].{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=174–175}} Despite initial misgivings, Berger also proposed the formation of a [[Latvian Legion]], which was approved at the end of 1942.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=176}}

====Further ''Volksdeutsche'' recruiting====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Bueschel-069-31, Russland, Kradfahrer der Waffen-SS.jpg|thumb|left|In late 1942, the SS Cavalry Brigade was used as the cadre for the SS Cavalry Division|alt=a black and white photograph of a German military motorcycle crew with several horses in the background]]
In the meantime, the ''Waffen-SS'' had suffered over 43,000 casualties up to February 1942, particularly in the [[Battle of Moscow]],{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=165–168}} and Berger had to replace them.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=302}} Berger next turned his attention to the Hungarian ''Volksdeutsche''. Through an agreement with the [[Royal Hungarian Army]], his recruiters enlisted more than 16,500 ethnic German recruits from Hungary between March and May 1942.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=172}} While this campaign was ongoing, on 20 April 1942 Berger was promoted to ''SS-[[Gruppenführer]]''.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}} At this point, he saw a significant difference between SS ideological leadership and the martial indoctrination conducted by the German Army.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=215}} In September 1942, the SS-FHA complained bitterly about Berger's recruiters, stating that many of the recruits were medically unsuitable, had been coerced or duped into enlisting, or were in fact ethnic Hungarians.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=172–173}} Late in 1942, more ''Volksdeutsche'' from the Banat and Romania were combined with the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] to form the [[8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer|''SS-Kavallerie-Division'']].{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=202}} On 24 November 1942, the Chief of the [[Gestapo]], [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]] advised Himmler of a proposal he had received from Berger that a Hungarian SS division could be financed by selling emigration permits to [[History of the Jews in Slovakia|Slovak Jews]].{{sfn|Reitlinger|1953|p=391}}

====The &quot;national legions&quot;====
The &quot;national legions&quot; were attached to the ''Waffen-SS'', and fought on the Eastern Front in 1942 and early 1943.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=302–304}} Unable to replace their losses, most of the survivors were incorporated into [[11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland|''SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland'']], authorised by Hitler at the end of 1942. The three regiments of the new division were formed using survivors of the [[Free Corps Denmark|''Freikorps Danemark'']], Legion ''Niederlande'' and [[Norwegian Legion|Legion ''Norwegen'']], supplemented by transfers from ''SS-Division Wiking'', new recruits from the occupied West European countries, and Reich Germans. Legion ''Flandern'' was broken up and used as replacements in a number of ''Waffen-SS'' formations.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=162–163}} While Weale states that they were mainly motivated by anti-communism,{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=303}} the historian George C. Stein observes that few of the &quot;national legion&quot; recruits were motivated by &quot;political or ideological idealism&quot;, but were instead motivated by such factors as a desire for adventure, better food, the prestige of the uniform, and personal circumstances. According to Stein, Berger had no illusions about the motives of his West European recruits, but paid mere lip service to the idea that they joined the &quot;anti-communist&quot; cause out of idealism.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=141}} Around 25,000 Dutch, 5,000 Danish and 3,900 Norwegian men served in the ''Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2003|p=286}} However, by mid-1942 onwards, the ''Waffen-SS'' faced increasing difficulties with these &quot;Germanic&quot; recruits, especially due to the policy of integrating them into &quot;pan-Germanic&quot; formations such as ''SS-Division Wiking''. For example, Norwegian recruits began requesting their release from duty, and at the beginning of 1943, nearly the entire Finnish battalion of that division asked to be released from their service obligations.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|pp=328–329}}

===1943===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J27050, Panzergrenadiere der SS-Panzer-Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;.jpg|thumb|Young soldiers of the 12th SS Panzergrenadier Division ''Hitlerjugend'' receiving the Iron Cross|alt=a black and white photograph of a line of Waffen-SS soldiers on parade]]
In November 1942, orders were issued for the conversion of LSSAH, ''Das Reich'' and ''Totenkopf'' into [[panzergrenadier]] divisions, and the following month, Hitler ordered the formation of two more panzergrenadier divisions, the first new ''Waffen-SS'' divisions to be raised from Reich Germans since 1940. These were named [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|''Hohenstaufen'']] and [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|''Frundsberg'']].{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=202–203}}

From the time that he had taken over as chief of the SS-HA, Berger had made considerable efforts to increase the amount of ideological training received by ''Waffen-SS'' personnel.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=209}} In February 1943, in the wake of the German losses at [[Stalingrad]], Berger again told Himmler that the SS needed stronger ideological training. As a result, the SS-HA issued a series of pamphlets on racial ideology, including ''Der Untermensch'' (The Sub-Human), which described certain peoples as spiritually and mentally lower than animals.{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} Himmler and Berger also hosted representatives from the Wehrmacht who were keen to learn from SS expertise in ideological indoctrination.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|pp=213–214}} On 13 February, following an approach from ''Reichsjugendführer'' (German Youth Leader) [[Artur Axmann]] for a ''Waffen-SS'' division to be raised from the Hitler Youth, Berger and Axmann were told the idea had been approved by Hitler and that they could commence planning. Berger implored Himmler to appoint him as the commander of this new division, but the ''Reichsfuhrer'' demurred, telling Berger not to be impatient.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=205}} Also in February, Berger complained to Himmler that the dispersal of &quot;Germanic&quot; volunteers throughout the ''Waffen-SS'' was having significant negative effects on the recruiting of replacements in the occupied countries.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=329}} In March 1943, ''Wiking'' was also upgraded to a panzergrenadier division.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=203}}

In April, losses at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and in [[Tunisia Campaign|Tunisia]] allowed Berger to recruit from foreign workers in the Reich, over the objections of ''Reichsminister'' [[Albert Speer]], the Minister for Armaments and War Production. By August, he had recruited 8,105 of these labourers, and 3,154 had already completed selection for the ''Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Trigg|2012|p=155}} In June, Berger was promoted to ''SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS'',{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=118}} and later the same month the new division, [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzergrenadier Division ''Hitlerjugend'']] was officially activated.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=208}}

On 5 July 1943, Berger was awarded the [[German Cross]] in silver.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=1219}} By the end of 1942, the &quot;Germanic&quot; SS had been integrated into the wider Allgemeine SS, and Berger drew up a badge to reward sporting prowess, skills highly prized among SS members. The result was the [[Germanic Proficiency Runes]], which Himmler approved on 1 August 1943, although it is believed less than 200 were actually awarded.{{sfn|Lumsden|2009|p=141}}

In November 1943, when German-installed Latvian authorities threatened to resign over conscription, Berger suggested they be sent to a concentration camp.{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2003|p=62}} By the end of 1943, the former &quot;national legions&quot; had been significantly expanded. The Dutch regiment of ''SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland'' was used to form an independent [[23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland|''SS-Panzergrenadierbrigade Nederland'']], and a revamped Flemish contingent was assembled into the [[27th SS Volunteer Division Langemarck|''SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Langemarck'']]. The Wehrmacht also gave up its French volunteer regiment and the Wallonian Legion, which became the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|''SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade France'']] and [[Walloon Legion|''SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Wallonien'']]. By the end of the war, all of these formations had been given divisional status in the ''Waffen-SS'', despite the fact that they never grew to more than brigade strength.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=163–164}} In relation to these recruits, Berger cynically observed, &quot;For every foreign-born soldier who dies, no German mother weeps&quot;.{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2003|p=286}} By August 1943, the crisis in the &quot;Germanic&quot; project was obvious, with Berger observing that &quot;we have come to the end of our tether in the Germanic countries&quot;.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=329}}  

The complaints from the SS-FHA about the quality of ''Volksdeutsche'' recruits had no effect on Berger's approach. He concluded further agreements with Hungary and Romania, and imposed on the [[Puppet state|puppet regimes]] of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak State]], to effectively authorise the unrestricted conscription of ethnic Germans in those territories. In the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]], the General Government (annexed Poland) and parts of the Soviet Union, ethnic Germans were conscripted into the ''Waffen-SS'' in the same arbitrary manner Reich Germans were conscripted by the Wehrmacht. By the end of 1943, a quarter of the strength of the ''Waffen-SS'' was made up of ''Volksdeutsche''.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=173}}

====The Baltic divisions====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16133, Lettland, Appell der SS-Legion.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Latvian Legion]] on the march in late 1943|alt=a black and white photograph of soldiers in German uniform and greatcoats marching in a column]]
Before either Baltic legion could complete training, these developments were overtaken by heavy casualties suffered by the West European legions on the Eastern Front, and like the West European legions, it was decided to combine the Baltic legions into larger formations. This resulted in the ''Estnische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade'', consisting of the Estonian Legion and elements of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade, and the ''Lettische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade'', formed around the Latvian Legion and parts of the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. The origins of many of the men of the two SS infantry brigades was Reich German or ''Volksdeutsche'', so these two formations were never purely Baltic. Not long after the two new volunteer brigades had been formed and committed to battle, they were upgraded to divisional status, and a third Baltic division was authorised, using the manpower of the Latvian security battalions. To man and maintain these three new divisions, Himmler ordered the conscription of Estonian and Latvian men, and made all former Estonian Army officers and non-commissioned officers liable for service. By 1944, the ''Waffen-SS'' included the three divisions, namely; the [[15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian)]], the [[19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian)]], and the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)]]. The two Latvian divisions were later combined into the [[VI SS Army Corps (Latvian)]], and all three divisions fought the Soviet [[Red Army]] in defence of their homelands during 1944, and were encircled there or destroyed in subsequent fighting elsewhere.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=177–179}}

====The Balkan Muslim divisions====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-116-11, Waffen-SS, 13. Gebirgs-Div. &quot;Handschar&quot;.jpg|thumb|Berger assisted in the recruitment of Bosnian Muslims for the ''Waffen-Division Handschar'' in 1943.|alt=a black and white photograph of men wearing Waffen-SS camouflage jackets and a fez]]
By February 1943,{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=305}} Himmler's ideals of ''Waffen-SS'' racial purity had been significantly diluted. The first division to be raised by Berger's recruiters that was clearly outside the ''Waffen-SS'' racial and ethnic strictures used manpower from the [[Bosniaks|Muslim]] community of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=179}} The [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)|13th ''Waffen'' Mountain Division of the SS ''Handschar'' (1st Croatian)]] first went into action in February 1944, and was of limited value, especially outside of its area of operations in eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=306}} While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia,{{sfn|Bishop|2007|pp=137–138}} the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=499}} but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=180}} civilians in the security zone.{{sfn|Williamson|2004|p=123}}{{sfn|Keegan|1970|p=105}} Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by the spring and summer of 1944.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=191}}

During 1944, two more Muslim divisions were raised, the [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg|21st ''Waffen'' Mountain Division of the SS ''Skanderbeg'' (1st Albanian)]] made up [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]], and the [[23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian)|23rd ''Waffen'' Mountain Division of the SS ''Kama'' (2nd Croatian)]], also made up of Bosnian Muslims. Neither of these divisions were of significant combat value, and all three Muslim divisions were dissolved before the end of 1944.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=181–185}}

====A Ukrainian SS division====
At the same time as the Balkan Muslim experiment, divisions were raised from Ukrainian, Russian and Hungarian men, demonstrating that racial exclusivity was no longer an entry requirement for the ''Waffen-SS''. In April 1943, a recruiting campaign began among Ukrainians living in that part of General Government (Polish) territory that had been in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] prior to 1919. These Ukrainian nationalists had been referred to by Himmler as &quot;sub-human&quot; only a matter of months before. The resulting division was the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)|14th ''Waffen'' Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)]]. After a brief period of desperate fighting in mid-1944 during the Soviet [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive]], only 3,000 escaped encirclement and destruction from an original strength of 14,000. Less than outstanding in combat, the division never saw action again.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=185–186}}

===1944===
In early 1944, the SS directed the governments of Hungary and the Slovak State to transfer to the ''Waffen-SS'' all the ''Volksdeutsche'' serving in their armed forces. This amounted to another 50,000 troops.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=173–174}} During 1944, Berger gave a speech in which he advocated a &quot;Germanic Reich&quot; that included all the countries that had Germanic or Nordic populations. He said, &quot;Since the ''Schutzstaffel'' was taken over by the ''Reichsführer-SS'' in 1929, its long-term goal has been the Germanic Reich. This long-term goal inevitably forms part of the SS claim to be a formation of Nordic men. It cannot be stopped by artificially drawn boundaries&quot;.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|pp=335–336}} He was also concerned that the SS was losing its previous dominance in ideological matters, as the Wehrmacht had largely adopted the ideological maxims of the SS. This narrowing of the ideological gap between the ''Waffen-SS'' and the Army was of considerable concern to SS leaders such as Berger, as it undermined the legitimacy of the SS as the leaders of the Nazi project.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|pp=215–216 &amp; 220}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0301-503, General Wlassow mit Soldaten der ROA.jpg|thumb|left|The soldiers of the 29th ''Waffen'' Grenadier Division of the SS were handed over to the Russian Liberation Army of Andrey Vlasov|alt=a black and white photograph of a bespectacled Andrey Vlasov in German uniform addressing some soldiers]]
The Galician approach was repeated in mid-1944 in the face of mounting casualties from Soviet offensives. Security units manned by Russians and Ukrainians were combined to form two more divisions, the [[29th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS RONA (1st Russian)|29th ''Waffen'' Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Russian)]] and [[30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS|30th ''Waffen'' Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian)]]. Neither reached more than regimental size. The first division was handed over to the [[Russian Liberation Army]] of [[Andrey Vlasov]] before it saw combat, and the second saw action on the Western Front in late 1944 before being reconstituted as a &quot;[[White Russia|White Ruthenian]]&quot; brigade in March 1945. It too saw no further action.{{sfn|Stein|1984|pp=187–188}}

In the period from late 1944, more Eastern European formations were hurriedly raised by Berger's recruiters or converted from existing smaller units. These included the [[25th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Hunyadi (1st Hungarian)|25th ''Waffen'' Grenadier Division of the SS ''Hunyadi'' (1st Hungarian)]], [[26th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Hungarian)|26th ''Waffen'' Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Hungarian)]], [[31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division]], and a number of smaller formations of brigade and regimental size. Several [[Cossacks|Cossack]] units were also transferred from the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=188}} Even the ''Sonderkommando Dirlewanger'' was increased in size, taking on Russian [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to boost its numbers.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=305–306}}

==Other wartime activities==

===Eastern Territories===
In July 1942,{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=1034}} Berger was appointed as Himmler's liaison officer with the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories|Reichsminister for the Occupied Eastern Territories]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. To bolster his position with Himmler, Rosenberg was even willing to appoint Berger as his second state secretary, but Hitler would not allow it. On 10 August 1943,{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2003|pp=115–116}} Berger convinced Rosenberg to appoint him as the Chief of Political Operations in the Occupied Eastern Territories. Himmler had long wanted such responsibilities to be placed in SS hands, and this appointment meant that Berger could sabotage any resistance to SS domination of the economy and population of the subjugated east.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=201–202}} The appointment took effect on 10 August 1943, and lasted until January 1945.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=1034}} In this role, Berger proposed a plan to kidnap and enslave 50,000 Eastern European children between the ages of 10 and 14, under the codename ''[[Heuaktion]]''.{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=268}} On 14 June 1944, Rosenberg issued orders implementing Berger's idea.{{sfn|McDonald|2000|p=715}}

===Prisoners of war===
[[File:Colditz Castle1.jpg|thumb|Colditz Castle, where the ''Prominente'' were kept until transported south and handed over the Americans on Berger's orders|alt=a whitewashed building with a red tiled roof, part of Colditz Castle]]
On 20 July 1944, the responsibility for administration of German prisoner of war (POW) camps was transferred to Berger.{{sfn|Lumsden|2009|p=85}} This followed the [[20 July plot|failed attempt on Hitler's life]] earlier that month, when the ''Führer'' turned to his &quot;faithful Heinrich&quot; to head the [[Replacement Army]], and the SS chief quickly delegated the responsibility to Berger. By September, the responsibility had been formally transferred to Himmler,{{sfn|Nichol|Rennell|2002|pp=470–471}} but Berger did not act to integrate his new responsibilities into the SS bureaucracy. Instead, he allowed the camps to continue as they were, with the same staff and procedures.{{sfn|Nichol|Rennell|2002|pp=473–474}}

After the war, Berger claimed that he had been reluctant to take on this new responsibility, and had told Hitler, resulting in a [[dressing down]]. He also claimed that Hitler had told him to destroy stored [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] supplies, stop Red Cross inspections, and block the arrival of further Red Cross supplies to the camps. Further, he asserted that Hitler had wanted more shootings of POWs and harsher punishments. According to Berger, he had quietly avoided carrying out these orders, and even countered a plan by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' to establish POW centres in major cities, using the POWs as [[human shield]]s against air raids. Authors [[John Nichol (RAF officer)|John Nichol]] and Tony Rennell observed that none of these claims have ever been independently verified, but some testimony has refuted Berger's claims. They concluded that most, if not all, of Berger's claims about his actions to assist POWs are &quot;unbelievable&quot;,{{sfn|Nichol|Rennell|2002|pp=473–475}} and noted that he did not raise any of these claims during his trial at [[Nuremberg]] after the war, or even in his autobiography.{{sfn|Nichol|Rennell|2002|p=482}} One of the few claims that has been verified to some extent is his work to protect the ''Prominente'', a group of high-ranking or otherwise important POWs that had been held at [[Oflag IV-C|Colditz Castle]] until 13 April 1945. There were a total of 21 ''Prominente'', including [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|Viscount Lascelles]] and [[John Elphinstone, 17th Lord Elphinstone|the Master of Elphinstone]], both nephews of [[George VI|King George VI]], and [[Giles Romilly]], a nephew of the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]. Berger arranged for them to be evacuated from Colditz and transported south and handed over to advancing U.S. Army troops.{{sfn|Nichol|Rennell|2002|pp=483–484}}

===Slovak uprising===
On 23 August 1944, an [[Slovak National Uprising|uprising]] broke out against the German puppet government in the Slovak State. The revolt was centred on [[Banská Bystrica]] high in the [[Low Tatras|Low Tatra]] mountains. The rebellion was led by several former members of the Government, and included elements of the Slovak Army and some British-trained parachutists. The uprising was relying on a rapid advance of the Red Army into the Slovak State. Despite the fact that the Soviet armies were just over {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip}} away at the time the revolt began, they did not reach the rebels in time. On 31 August, Berger was appointed Military Commander in Slovakia, and held sway for the next three weeks.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1953|p=392}} His tasks were to disarm the Slovak Army, ensure lines of communication to the Eastern Front and restore order. He was also to work with the right-wing [[Hlinka Guard]] to establish a new armed force in the puppet state. A new Slovak government was established under the leadership of [[Štefan Tiso]].{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2003|pp=98–99}} Berger's initial force consisted of several [[ad hoc]] ''[[Kampfgruppe|kampfgruppen]]'' (combat groups) totalling 10,000 men, against a rebel army of some 47,000.{{sfn|Müller|2014|p=94}} On 9 September, Himmler advised Berger that he had been awarded the Iron Cross Second Class for his work in Slovakia.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=1219}} By mid-September, the uprising had yet to be quelled, and the only regions that had been pacified were western Slovakia and the [[Váh]] valley, although the rebels had been encircled. Due to Berger's lack of success,{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2003|p=99}} Himmler replaced him with a HSSPF, [[Hermann Höfle (SS general)|Hermann Höfle]],{{sfn|Reitlinger|1953|p=392}} and Berger relinquished the role of Military Commander in Slovakia on 19 September.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=1219}} Höfle then bloodily suppressed the revolt with the assistance of additional troops that arrived in late October.{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2003|p=99}} Berger was then appointed to organise the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' (Home Guard) in Germany.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=1219}}

===''Volkssturm'' chief of staff===
As Germany's situation deteriorated, Hitler decided to form the ''Volkssturm'', a Nazi Party local militia to defend communities within the Reich. On 24 September 1944, Hitler appointed his private secretary and head of the Reich Chancellery, ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' [[Martin Bormann]] to form the ''Volkssturm''. Himmler was given responsibility for the military organisation and equipment of the new militia, which he delegated to Berger, who became one of two chiefs of staff for the organisation. Bormann resisted Berger's attempts to take over the ''Volkssturm'', and it remained largely under Bormann's control, with local recruiting conducted by the ''[[Gauleiter]]s''.{{sfn|Beck|2013|p=160}}

===Field command===
In the last few months of the war, the Western Allies became concerned that Hitler would concentrate his remaining forces in a [[redoubt]] in the Alps. While this idea was more along the lines of a potential refuge from the Russians rather than a fortress, fears of the existence of an &quot;[[Alpine Fortress]]&quot; resulted in the diversion of strong forces towards the southern parts of the Reich to forestall such a plan. In fact, at a surrender ceremony on 5 May, German ''[[General der Infanterie]]'' [[Hermann Foertsch]] astonished General [[Jacob L. Devers]], commander of the [[Sixth United States Army Group]], when he told him that as many as 350,000 German troops were still cut off in the Alps. Berger commanded a ''kampfgruppe'' of remnants of the [[XIII SS Army Corps]],{{sfn|Fritz|2004|p=22}} including fragments of the [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzergrenadier Division ''Götz von Berlichingen'']], [[35th SS and Police Grenadier Division]], and the [[2nd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Mountain Division]]. Berger intended to surrender separately to American forces, and after two days delay, managed to locate a regimental commander of the [[101st Airborne Division]] near [[Berchtesgaden]] south of [[Salzburg]].{{sfn|Wyant|1991|p=202–203}} On the following day, Berger was arrested.{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}}

==Assessments==
Berger has been described as &quot;blustery&quot;,{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=179}} cynical,{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2003|p=286}} and &quot;one of Himmler's most competent and ruthless war-time lieutenants&quot;.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=155}} An ardent [[Antisemitism|anti-Semite]], he was also a proponent of the [[Final Solution]].{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=128}} The historian Gerhard Rempel described him as a skilled bureaucratic manipulator, who was &quot;unscrupulous, blunt, and inelegant in manner and expression, yet also full of genial loquacity and racy humour&quot;.{{sfn|Rempel|1989|p=35}} Despite his own unassailable position at the head of the SS, Himmler was often distracted by Berger's gossip and subterfuge against other leaders within the SS.{{sfn|Wegner|1990|p=302}}

Within the SS, Berger was known as one of Himmler's &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot;,{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=198}} and was nicknamed &quot;''der Allmaechtige Gottlob''&quot; (&quot;the Almighty Gottlob&quot;, a play on &quot;The Almighty God&quot;, as &quot;Gott&quot; is the German word for &quot;God&quot;).{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=254}} He was also referred to by the phrase &quot;Praise God&quot; and another nickname was &quot;The Duke of Swabia&quot;, reflecting his [[Swabia]]n origins.{{sfn|Butler|1990|p=81}}

Ultimately, Berger was responsible for the large numbers of non-Reich foreign recruits that joined the ''Waffen-SS'' between 1940 and 1945. Despite the fact that Berger would have preferred a field command, he was one of Himmler's few trusted senior lieutenants, and his recruiting and organisational skills meant he was kept as chief of the SS-HA throughout the war. The only exception was the short period as military commander in the Slovak State in the autumn of 1944 during the uprising.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=118–119}} In September 1939, the number of non-Germans in what soon became the ''Waffen-SS'' was minimal. By May 1945, the force included 38 divisions, and the majority were non-Germans. None of the 38 divisions were exclusively manned by Reich Germans, and half were made up of mostly of personnel from outside the Reich.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=137}}

==War crimes trial==
[[File:Wilhelmstr Prozess Nürnberg WEB.JPG|thumb|Defendants of the [[Ministries Trial]] sit in the dock at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]]. Gottlob Berger is sitting on the second row, second from left.|alt=a black and white photograph of a US court room in Nuremberg with several rows of German defendants sitting on a tiered stand with guards standing behind them]]
After his arrest in May 1945, Berger remained in Allied custody pending a trial before a US military tribunal for various war crimes. He was initially to be a defendant in the proposed &quot;Prisoners of War&quot; Trial, but was eventually included in what became known as the [[Ministries Trial]] of the [[subsequent Nuremberg trials]]. The final indictment against Berger and his co-defendants was lodged on 18 November 1947; the trial commenced on 6 January 1948,{{sfn|Heller|2011|p=79}} before Judges Christianson (presiding), Maguire and Powers, and ended on 13 April 1949.{{sfn|Heller|2011|p=103}}

===Indictment===
There were eight counts that formed the indictment against Berger:{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=308, 447–454}}
#Crimes against peace
#Common plan and conspiracy
#War crimes, murder, and ill-treatment of belligerents and POWs, including the murder of French ''Général de division'' [[Gustave Mesny]], a POW who was killed in reprisal for the death of ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Fritz von Brodowski]] at the hands of the [[French Forces of the Interior|French resistance]] in October 1944 while Berger was chief of the POW camps
#This count was stricken during the trial
#War crimes and crimes against humanity, atrocities and offences committed against civilian populations
#Plunder and spoliation
#Slave labour
#Membership in criminal organisations

===Berger's evidence===
During his trial, Berger claimed that he had not been aware of the Final Solution until after the war, but the prosecution produced evidence that he had been present at the first of Himmler's infamous 1943 [[Posen speeches]] in which the ''Reichsfuhrer-SS'' had explicitly spoken of the extermination of Jews. Berger's defence counsel claimed that his client did not believe the word &quot;extermination&quot; had been used by Himmler with regard to Jews during the speech. Berger's lawyer went on in an attempt to mitigate Berger's actions by claiming that the [[Cold War]] bore strong parallels to the Nazi fight against &quot;Jews and Bolsheviks&quot;, and the possibility that the US would also have to fight the Soviet Union in the near future.{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=145}} During the war, Berger wrote in an article, &quot;We the National Socialists believe the Fuhrer when he says that the annihilation of Jewry in Europe stands at the end of the fight instigated by the Jewish World Parasite against us as his strongest enemy.&quot;{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=128}} Berger and others also claimed that the unit commanded by Dirlewanger was not part of the SS, although when the text of Himmler's second Posen speech was uncovered in 1953, it &quot;cast dubious light&quot; on Berger's claim.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1957|p=174}} He displayed no remorse for his actions.{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}}

The majority of the tribunal declared that &quot;it seems impossible to believe Berger's testimony that he knew nothing of the plans to destroy the Jews or that he never heard of the &quot;final solution&quot;  until after the war.&quot; However, the court accepted his claim that he saved the lives of Allied POWs whose safety was gravely imperiled by Hitler's orders that they be shot or held as hostages. The court determined that Berger had disobeyed orders and placed himself in danger in order to intervene on behalf of the POWs in question.{{sfn|Heller|2011|p=325}} In contrast, Berger was found guilty of transporting Hungarian Jews to concentration camps and recruiting concentration camp guards.{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=155}} Berger also stated in his evidence that he considered Himmler &quot;an unassimilated half-breed and unfit for the SS&quot;.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1957|p=16}}

===Judgement===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S73495, Oskar Dirlewanger.jpg|thumb|Berger's friend ''Obersturmführer'' Oskar Dirlewanger commanded the eponymous ''SS-Sonderkommando'' from its inception.|alt=a black and white photograph of Oskar Dirlewanger in Waffen-SS uniform]]
Berger was acquitted under counts one,{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=417}} and two,{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=436}} and some parts of counts three,{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=441–447}} and five,{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=528–546}} and was also acquitted under count six.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=727}} He was convicted under that part of count three relating to the murder of Mesny,{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=447–454}} and under those parts of count five relating to his involvement with the SS-''Sonderkommando Dirlewanger'',{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=541–546}} for being a conscious participant in the concentration camp program,{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=447–558}} and the conscription of nationals of other countries.{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=548–552}} He was also convicted under that part of count seven relating to the children and youth slave labour program, including the ''Heuaktion'',{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=821–822}} and was also convicted under count eight.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=860}} Judge Powers handed down a dissenting opinion, stating that he was of the view that Berger was not responsible for the murder of Mesny.{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=906–909}}

===Sentence and review===
On the counts under which he was convicted, Berger was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, but received credit for the nearly four years during which he had been in custody awaiting trial.{{sfn|NMT|1949|p=867}} Peter Maguire observes that given the status of the defendants and the body of evidence against them, the sentences given to all those indicted in the Ministries Trial were light.{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=157}}

The sentences were reviewed by an Advisory Board for Clemency for War Criminals, which was responsible for providing advice to the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany [[John J. McCloy]]. On 31 January 1951, McCloy determined to reduce Berger's sentence to 10 years imprisonment, stating that he appeared to have been unjustly convicted for the murder of Mesny, and that McCloy had given greater weight to Berger's active interventions &quot;to save the lives of Allied officers and men who under Hitler orders were held for liquidation or as hostages&quot;.{{sfn|NMT|1949|pp=1003–1004}} McCloy did not explain why Berger could not be held responsible for the murder of Mesny, despite the majority finding of the tribunal that Berger bore &quot;command responsibility&quot; for the murder.{{sfn|Heller|2011|pp=355–356}} Berger was released from [[Landsberg prison]] in December 1951, having spent a total of six and a half years in custody.{{sfn|Maguire|2013|p=206}}

==After release==
After his release from prison in 1951, Berger worked in Stuttgart and [[Böblingen]] in his native Baden-Württemberg, and managed a curtain rail factory.{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} He also contributed articles to the monthly right-wing journal ''[[Nation Europa]]'' published in [[Coburg]],{{sfn|Reitlinger|1957|p=174}}{{sfn|Lemke|2011|p=25}} and occasionally wrote articles encouraging the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] to give greater consideration to former members of the ''Waffen-SS''.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1957|p=450}} He and his wife Christine had four children: Krista, Wolf, Helgart and Folkart.{{sfn|LEO-BW|2015}} He died on 5 January 1975 in Gerstetten.{{sfn|LBW|2015}}

[[File:Juives.jpg|thumb|alt=Sheet of paper on which &quot;The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing&quot; is written in cursive script|Copy of graffito in Goulston Street, attached to [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] Sir [[Charles Warren]]'s report to the [[Home Office]] on the Whitechapel murders.]]
The '''Goulston Street graffito''' was some writing on a wall that was found beside a clue in the 1888 [[Whitechapel murders]] investigation. The meaning of the graffito, and its possible connection to the crimes attributed to [[Jack the Ripper]], have been debated for over a century.

==Discovery==
The Whitechapel murders were a series of brutal attacks on women in the [[Whitechapel]] district in the [[East End of London]] that occurred between 1888 and 1891. Five of the murders are generally attributed to &quot;[[Jack the Ripper]]&quot;, whose identity remains unknown, while the perpetrator(s) of the remaining six cannot be verified or are disputed.

After the murders of [[Elizabeth Stride]] and [[Catherine Eddowes]] during the night of 30 September 1888, police searched the area near the crime scenes in an effort to locate a suspect, witnesses or evidence. At about 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., Constable Alfred Long of the [[Metropolitan Police Force]] discovered a dirty, bloodstained piece of an apron in the stairwell of a [[tenement]], 108 to 119 Model dwellings, Goulston Street, Whitechapel.

The cloth was later confirmed as being a part of the apron worn by Catherine Eddowes. Above it, there was writing in white chalk on either the wall or the black brick jamb of the entranceway.&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Rumbelow, p. 132; Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
Long told an inquest that it read, &quot;The Juwes {{sic}} are the men that will not be blamed for nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Constable Long's inquest testimony, 11 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 213, 233; Marriott, pp. 148–149, 153 and Rumbelow, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Superintendent Arnold wrote a report which agrees with his account.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, pp.498-499&lt;/ref&gt;
Detective Constable Daniel Halse of the [[City of London Police]], arrived a short time later, and took down a different version: &quot;The Juwes are not the men who will be blamed for nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Detective Constable Halse's inquest testimony, 11 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 214–215, 234 and Marriott, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; A third version, &quot;The Juws {{sic}} are not the men To be blamed for nothing&quot;, was recorded by City surveyor, Frederick William Foster.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; A copy according with Long's version of the message was attached to a report from [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] Sir [[Charles Warren]] to the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; A summary report on the writing by Chief Inspector Swanson rendered it as &quot;The Jewes {{sic}} are not the men to be blamed for nothing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.499&quot;&gt;Philip Sugden, &quot;The Complete History of Jack the Ripper&quot;, p.499&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is uncertain if Swanson ever saw the writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philip Sugden p.499&quot;/&gt;

==Removal==
Since the murder of [[Mary Ann Nichols]] on 31 August 1888, rumours had been circulating that the killings were the work of a [[Jew]] dubbed &quot;Leather Apron&quot;, which had resulted in [[antisemitic]] demonstrations. One Jew, [[John Pizer]], who had a reputation for violence against prostitutes and was nicknamed &quot;Leather Apron&quot; from his trade as a bootmaker, was arrested but released after his alibis for the murders were corroborated.&lt;ref&gt;Begg, p. 157; Marriott, pp.59–75; Rumbelow, pp.49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Police Superintendent]] [[Thomas Arnold (policeman)|Thomas Arnold]] visited the scene and saw the writing. Later, in his report of 6 November to the Home Office, he claimed, that with the strong feeling against the Jews that already existed, the message might have become the means of causing a riot:

{{quote|I beg to report that on the morning of the 30th Sept. last, my attention was called to some writing on the wall of the entrance to some dwellings at No. 108 Goulston Street, Whitechapel which consisted of the following words: &quot;The Juews&lt;!--This is not a typo! This is the spelling given in the original document.--&gt; are not [the word 'not' being deleted] the men that will not be blamed for nothing&quot;, and knowing in consequence of suspicion having fallen upon a Jew named 'John Pizer' alias 'Leather Apron' having committed a murder in Hanbury Street a short time previously, a strong feeling existed against the Jews generally, and as the Building upon which the writing was found was situated in the midst of a locality inhabited principally by that Sect, I was apprehensive that if the writing were left it would be the means of causing a riot and therefore considered it desirable that it should be removed having in view the fact that it was in such a position that it would have been rubbed by persons passing in &amp; out of the Building.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Superintendent Arnold's report, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', pp. 24–25 and ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 185–188&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Charles Warren.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Moustached man in uniform emblazoned with medals|Police Commissioner Charles Warren]]
Religious tensions were already high, and there had already been many near-riots. Arnold ordered a man to be standing by with a sponge to erase the writing, while he consulted Commissioner Warren. Covering it in order to allow time for a photographer to arrive or removing a portion of it were considered, but Arnold and Warren (who personally attended the scene) considered this to be too dangerous, and Warren later stated he &quot;considered it desirable to obliterate the writing at once&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, p. 197 and Marriott, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
While the Goulston Street graffito was found in Metropolitan Police territory, the apron piece was from a victim killed in the [[City of London]], which has a separate police force. Some officers disagreed with Arnold and Warren's decision, especially those representing the City of London Police, who thought the writing constituted part of a crime scene and should at least be photographed before being erased,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, City Commissioner Sir Henry Smith's memoirs, ''From Constable to Commissioner'', p. 161, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; but it was wiped from the wall at 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;Constable Long's inquest testimony, 11 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 214 and Marriott, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the police officer supervising the Whitechapel murders investigation, the writing on the wall did not match the handwriting of the notorious [[Dear Boss letter|&quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter]], which claimed responsibility for the killings and used the signature &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (though it is widely thought that the letter was not written by the killer).&lt;ref name=E&amp;S185&gt;Chief Inspector Swanson's report, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 185–188&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary police concluded that the text was a semi-literate attack on the area's Jewish population.&lt;ref name=E&amp;S185/&gt;

[[File:Goulston Street.jpg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the graffito (red triangle) in relation to 6 of the murder sites (red circles). Bottom left: [[Mitre Square]] (where [[Catherine Eddowes]] was found); Bottom right: [[Berner Street]] (where [[Elizabeth Stride]] was found). Others (clockwise from top): [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]] ([[Mary Jane Kelly]]), [[Osborn Street]] ([[Emma Elizabeth Smith]]), [[George Yard]] ([[Martha Tabram]]), [[Castle Alley]] ([[Whitechapel murders#Alice McKenzie|Alice McKenzie]]).]]
The police interviewed all the residents of 108–119 Goulston Street, but were unable to trace either the writer of the graffito or the murderer.

According to historian [[Philip Sugden (historian)|Philip Sugden]] there are at least three permissible interpretations of this particular clue: &quot;All three are feasible, not one capable of proof.&quot; The first is that the writing was not the work of the murderer at all: the apron piece was dropped near the writing either incidentally or by design. The second would be to &quot;take the murderer at his word&quot;—a Jew incriminating himself and his people. The third interpretation was, according to Sugden, the one most favoured at the Scotland Yard and by &quot;Old Jewry&quot;: The chalk message was a deliberate subterfuge, designed to incriminate the Jews and throw the police off the track of the real murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Sugden, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Dew]], a detective constable in Whitechapel, tended to think that the writing was irrelevant and unconnected to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Dew's memoirs, ''I Caught Crippen'', quoted in Fido, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Chief Inspector Henry Moore and Sir [[Robert Anderson (Scotland Yard official)|Robert Anderson]], both from [[Scotland Yard]], thought that the graffito was the work of the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Sugden, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Author [[Martin Fido]] notes that the writing included a [[double negative]], a common feature of [[Cockney]] speech. He suggests that the writing might be translated into standard English as &quot;Jews will not take responsibility for anything&quot; and that the message was written by someone who believed he or she had been wronged by one of the many Jewish merchants or tradesmen in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Fido, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Philip Sugden has said that the spelling of &quot;Jews&quot; as &quot;Juwes&quot; could reflect a local dialect on the part of the author of the grafitto.&lt;ref&gt;Sugden, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

In the controversial book ''Jack the Ripper: British Intelligence Agent'', author and &quot;master of the paranormal&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostwalks.org/index.php/tours/ |title=Haunted Liverpool Ghost Tours|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Slemen claims that &quot;Juwes&quot; is a Manchurian word&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps unfortunately for Slemen's theory, the book ''A Manchu Grammar'' (in which [[Paul Georg von Möllendorff]] introduced the [[Transliterations of Manchu|romanization]] under which &quot;juwe&quot; represents the pronunciation of Manchu &quot;two&quot;) was not published until 1892, in [[Shanghai]]; and Manchu words are not pluralized with ''-s'' as in English.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning &quot;two&quot;, and that Sir Charles Warren, a respected archaeologist who had knowledge of both the Biblical and [[Manchu]] languages, must have recognised the out-of-place word, and yet claimed he was baffled by the reference. In 1909 (says Slemen), Warren presided over a lecture with [[Claude Reignier Conder]] entitled &quot;The Origins of the Chinese&quot; at London's [[Caxton Hall]], in which the similarities to the Manchu and European languages were pointed out, and the word ''Juwe'' was said to be the root of the English words ''dual'', ''duet'', ''duo''.&lt;ref&gt;In fact the Latin ''duo'' derives from the same [[Proto-Indo-European]] root as English ''two'', German ''zwei'', and [[Sanskrit]] ''dvau''. Manchu, being a [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language, is unlikely to have had much cross-pollination with the Indo-European family.&lt;/ref&gt; Slemen uses this theory to finger Conder as the Ripper.

A contemporaneous explanation was offered by [[Robert D'Onston Stephenson]], a journalist and writer interested in the [[occult]] and [[black magic]]. In an article (signed &quot;One Who Thinks He Knows&quot;) in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' of 1 December 1888, Stephenson concluded from the overall sentence construction, the double negative, the double definite article &quot;the Juwes are the men&quot;, and the unusual misspelling that the Ripper was most probably French. Stephenson claimed that an &quot;uneducated Englishman&quot; or &quot;ignorant Jew&quot; was unlikely to misspell &quot;Jew&quot;, whereas it was similar to the French ''juives''. He excluded French-speaking Swiss and Belgians from his suspicions because &quot;the idiosyncrasy of both those nationalities is adverse to this class of crime. On the contrary, in France, the murdering of prostitutes has long been practised, and has been considered to be almost peculiarly a French crime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 1 December 1888 ([http://www.casebook.org/press_reports/pall_mall_gazette/18881201.html Casebook Press Project copy]).&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was disputed by a native French speaker in a letter to the editor of that same publication that ran on 6 December.&lt;ref&gt;''Pall Mall Gazette'', 6 December 1888 ([http://www.casebook.org/press_reports/pall_mall_gazette/18881206.html Casebook Press Project copy]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:juwes1.jpg|thumb|A still from ''[[Murder by Decree]]'' showing its depiction of the Goulston Street graffito. The film portrays &quot;Juwes&quot; as a [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] term, and the original graffito was written in cursive script, not capitals.]]
Author [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]] suggested that &quot;Juwes&quot; referred not to &quot;Jews,&quot; but to Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum, the three killers of [[Hiram Abiff]], a semi-legendary figure in [[Freemasonry]], and furthermore, that the message was written by the killer (or killers) as part of a Masonic plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinalSolution&quot;&gt;Stephen Knight (1976). ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]''&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that anyone prior to Knight had ever referred to those three figures by the term &quot;Juwes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Begg, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Knight's suggestion was used in fictional treatments of the murders, such as the film ''[[Murder by Decree]]'', and the graphic novel ''[[From Hell]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Eddie Campbell]].

In addition to the confusion over the exact wording and meaning of the phrase, and whether it was written by the murderer or not, author and former homicide detective Trevor Marriott raised another possibility: the piece of apron may not necessarily have been dropped by the murderer on his way back to the [[East End]] from [[Mitre Square]]. The victim herself might have used it as a [[sanitary napkin|sanitary towel]], and dropped it on her way from the East End to Mitre Square.&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; In Marriott's own words, it is an explanation that &quot;many experts will regard as unbelievable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inconclusive==
To this day it is not fully agreed upon whether or not the graffito is relevant to the murders. Many modern researchers prefer the latter explanation, believing the apron fragment was discarded rather than placed and the presence of the graffiti was coincidental. They cite that [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] graffiti was commonplace in Whitechapel at the time and that such behaviours as specific placement of evidence and taking the time to write a message while evading the police is inconsistent with most existing [[Offender profiling|profiles]] of the killer.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, John; Olshaker, Mark (2001). ''[[The Cases That Haunt Us]]''. New York: Simon and Schuster. pp. 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, if the murderer had discarded the piece of apron, there must have been places where he could have done so between Mitre Square and the Goulston Street building.   If, as some writers contend, it was taken for the murderer to use to wipe his hands, he could have discarded it, immediately after it had served that purpose, by the body.  If that had been his purpose he need not in any case have cut it away but could have wiped his hands on it without removing it.&lt;ref&gt;Kendell, Colin 'Jack the Ripper - The Theories and The Facts' Amberley Publishing 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gourgen Mkrtich Yanikian''' ({{lang-hy|Գուրգեն Մկրտիչ Յանիկյան}}, December 24, 1895 – February 29, 1984) was an [[Armenian American]] author, [[engineer]], [[Armenian Genocide]] survivor, best known for the assassination of two [[Turkey|Turkish]] consular officials, Los Angeles Consul General [[Mehmet Baydar]] and Consul [[Bahadır Demir]], in [[California]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{citation | contribution-url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3DD1439F932A35750C0A962948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= | contribution = Imprisoned Armenian Dies | title = [[The New York Times]] | date = March 1, 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sentenced to life imprisonment, Yanikian was released on parole in January 1984.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Yanikian was born in [[Erzurum]] in 1895, at the height of the [[Hamidian massacres|anti-Armenian]] massacres that had taken hold of the eastern provinces of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. His family was able to flee to a safer location, but when they returned to Erzurum eight years later to retrieve personal possessions they had hidden in a barn, his elder brother Hagop was killed by two Turkish men.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian, Michael. ''Children of Armenia: A Forgotten Genocide and the Century-long Struggle for Justice''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2009, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Yanikian was studying to be an engineer at the [[Moscow State University|University of Moscow]] when World War I broke out. After learning of the Turkish persecution of Armenians during the [[Armenian Genocide|genocide of 1915-23]], he traveled to the [[Caucasus]] in the spring of 1915 and joined a volunteer regiment of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] to find out the fate of his family members, whom he had not heard from since the outbreak of the war and who were living in the Ottoman Empire. He was assigned to an engineering unit that was tasked with mapping out the geography of the terrain ahead of the regular troops. As the Russian army advanced, Yanikian witnessed first hand the destruction wrought against the Armenians. Upon his arrival in Erzurum, he found his father's business in ruins and recognized the bodies of two of his relatives. In the course of the genocide he lost twenty-six members of his extended family.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArmenianGuilty /&gt;&lt;ref name=ArmenianHeld&gt;{{citation | url = http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70C17F83E551A7493CBAB178AD85F478785F9 | contribution = Armenian Held in Coast Slaying of Two Turks | title = The New York Times | date = July 29, 1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Yanikian went on to complete his education in Russia and in 1930 moved to Iran together with his wife Suzanna. They settled in Tehran where Suzanna opened a gynecological clinic while Yanikian set up a civil engineering company called RAHSAZ.&lt;ref&gt;Kalaydjian, Tigran. ''Sentinel of Truth: Gourgen Yanikian and the Struggle Against the Denial of the Armenian Genocide''. SBPRA (2012). ISBN 978-1-62212-995-9 p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other construction projects, he oversaw the building of a railroad across Iran during the Second World War, as part of Allied efforts there, and became quite affluent.&lt;ref name=ArmenianGuilty&gt;{{citation | url = http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0F1FFE385C1A7A93C1A9178CD85F478785F9 | contribution = Armenian Guilty of Killing Turks | title = The New York Times | date = July 3, 1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the United States in 1946, via France.  He and his wife arrived in New York and moved to Beverly Hills where he opened the Yanikian Theater.  The theater did not do well.

The couple moved to Fresno, CA, where there was a large Armenian community.  He claims he was a radio host in Fresno.  After some years, he and his wife moved to Santa Barbara, CA.  He began developing properties, using his substantial savings.  Things did not go well however, and he lost most of his money in the project.  All the while, he had been writing and publishing several novels including {{citation | title = The Triumph of Judas Iscariot | year = 1950}}, ''Harem Cross'' (1953) and ''The Voice of an American'' (1960). By the late 1960s, Yanikian had lost most of his money, was living on welfare and his wife was in a care home with dementia unable to recognize him, even though he visited nearly every day and brought her chocolates.  Her medical care became a factor in his insolvency and his dependency.

A final straw came for him late in 1972 when the U.S. State Department wrote him a letter that he should make no more attempts to communicate with their office.  Yanikian had been attempting to collect money owed him from Iran for projects he had done during World War II.  Yanikian had exhausted every legal channel and hoped the State Department could evoke pressure for payment &lt;ref&gt;Trial Transcripts Yanikian's testimony&lt;/ref&gt; of $1.5 million he claimed he was owed for the construction work he had overseen there.

As a matter of fact, in 1944 the Iranian court issued an award in favor of Yanikian against [[Ministry of Roads and Transportation (Iran)|Iran's Ministry of Roads]], which stipulated that the Ministry was to compensate Yanikian for the implemented construction works by 26 November 1944, but the Ministry failed to pay the award until 15 August 1948, and Yanikian sought to recover the damages for the delay in payment. The Iranian government stated that Yanikian was paid in full, and the [[Iran–United States Claims Tribunal]] dismissed in 1985 the claims of Yanikian's attorneys citing the lack of jurisdiction over items of the claim.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Adlam, M. E. MacGlashan. Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Reports, Volume 8. Cambridge University Press, 1987. ISBN 0521464420, 9780521464420, pp 290-297&lt;/ref&gt; His despondency about the general state of his life has been thought to be a major factor in his act of planning and killing the Consul General and the Vice Consul General.&lt;ref&gt;Trial Transcripts Yanikian testimony&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letters of Psychiatric Evaluations of Yanikian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 141-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Memories of the genocide lingered in his mind and visions of his dead brother haunted him for years. The [[Republic of Turkey]]'s continual [[Denial of the Armenian Genocide|denial of the genocide]] remained a source of anguish and pain. Eventually, Yanikian, believing he had little left to live for, resolved to avenge the deaths of his family members and bring greater awareness to the genocide by organizing the assassination of the perpetrator country's agents, an act that took its cue from the example set by [[Soghomon Tehlirian]] fifty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 143-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination of Turkish consuls===
On January 27, 1973, the 77-year-old Yanikian lured the Turkish consul general [[Mehmet Baydar]], 47, and vice-consul [[Bahadır Demir]], 30, to a cottage at the [[Santa Barbara Biltmore|Biltmore Hotel]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], promising to make a gift to the nation of Turkey of a [[bank note]] and a painting stolen from the palace of the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]] more than a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fbMiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fLMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4349,3106195&amp;dq UPI. Author Yanikian Refuses To Plea].&quot; ''Beaver County Times''. Feb. 27, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Yanikian had contacted the consul general three months earlier, and insisted that the consul general personally accept the painting, and since Baydar did not drive, Demir was asked to accompany him to provide transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT&quot;&gt;&quot;Return of Painting Used as Lure in Consuls' Slayings, Police Say.&quot; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. January 29, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Baydar, married and the father of two daughters, was a career diplomat, who had previously served in Paris and Washington. Demir was on his first foreign assignment.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT&quot;/&gt; That neither man was alive during the genocide &quot;mattered little to Yanikian,&quot; according to journalist Michael Bobelian: &quot;Just as Ottoman dehumanization of the Armenians a half century earlier opened the door for so many ordinary citizens to participate in the Genocide, Yanikian came to view the men not as human beings, but as symbols of decades of injustice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanikian handed them the bank note, for which he was given a receipt, and the three men began to converse over lunch.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that Yanikian revealed to them that he was not Iranian, as he had told the consulate when he first contacted them, but Armenian. Baydar dropped the bank note in anger and a heated exchange took place. It was at this point that Yanikian yelled &quot;I will kill you,&quot; pulled a [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] pistol from a hollowed-out book and emptied nine rounds at them, hitting them in the shoulders and chest, though none of the wounds were lethal. As Baydar and Demir lay on the ground Yanikian pulled out a [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] pistol from a drawer and fired two rounds into the head of each man, &quot;what he considered mercy shots.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 147-48.&lt;/ref&gt; He phoned the front desk of the hotel from his room and requested that the sheriff be contacted, because &quot;I have just killed two men.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;ArmenianHeld&quot;/&gt;

Before meeting the Turkish diplomats, Yanikian had sent a letter to an Armenian language newspaper, urging Armenians to wage a war on Turkish diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;West, Richard. &quot;Armenian Held in 2 Slayings Urged 'War' on Turk Envoys.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times''. January 30, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish Embassy reacted to the killings by calling on the United States to take action to protect its nationals, and the American Ambassador in [[Ankara]] condemned the killings, stating he and all Americans were &quot;shocked at this senseless act of violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=ArmenianHeld /&gt; Fifty [[FBI]] agents were assigned to investigate Yanikian's background, including exploring possible (though ultimately non-existent) ties to the [[Soviets]] or to a well-organized &quot;Armenian gang.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Bobelian, ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 153-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and sentencing===
Yanikian pleaded not guilty to two charges of first degree murder. Although over the course of the trial he openly conceded that he had caused the deaths of the men, he insisted that he was not guilty of any crime.&lt;ref name=ArmenianGuilty /&gt; Yanikian insisted that what he did was &quot;destroy two evils,&quot; as the victims were &quot;not human&quot; for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;court&quot;&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/california/calapp3d/39/366.html People v. Yanikian 39 Cal. App. 3d 366].&lt;/ref&gt; Yanikian admitted that he conceived the assassination plan in April 1972, and meticulously implemented it over the intervening months between that time and the date of the actual homicides on January 27, 1973. He had originally planned to carry out the homicides in the consular offices, but changed his mind upon visiting the offices where he observed the presence of numerous employees who &quot;might try to be heroes and get hurt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;court&quot;/&gt;

In an interview with reporters in a court anteroom he slammed his hands down on the table and declared that other people &quot;have had their [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] but we have not.&quot;&lt;ref name = ArmenianGuilty /&gt; Yanikian's defense counsel, headed by defense attorney James T. Lindsey, had attempted to bring in survivors of the Armenian Genocide to testify as to the trauma of the experiences, as part of the defense strategy of depicting Yanikian as having &quot;diminished mental capacity,&quot; but these motions were denied in court.&lt;ref name =ArmenianGuilty /&gt; After Yanikian's death, District Attorney David D. Minier wrote, &quot;Looking back, I regret that I did not allow the genocide to be proven. Not because Yanikian should have gone free, but because history's darkest chapters — its genocides — should be exposed, so their horrors are less likely to be repeated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Armenians hoped Yanikian's trial would provide a vehicle for proving the massacres in a court of law, while there were still surviving witnesses, but District Attorney Minier didn't agree. Only Yanikian took the Armenian Genocide witness stand, accompanied by his friend and interpreter, Santa Barbaran Aram Saroyan, the uncle of famous author [[William Saroyan]]. Yanikian told of coming across mutilated corpses and finding the decapitated bodies of his relatives killed in the massacres, and how he watched in hiding as marauding Turks slit his brother's throat.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian. ''Children of Armenia'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded by saying that he killed the Turkish diplomats as representatives of the &quot;government that had massacred his people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{citation | contribution = Murder Will Out? District Attorney Regrets Not Allowing Genocide Testimony at Murder Trial | first = David D | last = Minier | title = [[The Independent]] | date = Apr 2, 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yanikian's defense was based entirely on his claim of diminished capacity. However, the jury did not find this to be convincing, because it was clear from the testimony of Yanikan that he understood he was taking the lives of two human beings and that he did so because he considered it justified.&lt;ref name=&quot;court&quot;/&gt;

Yanikian was sentenced to life in prison on July 2, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Bobelian, ''Children of Armenia'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Court of Appeals of California]] declined Yanikian's appeal and ruled that Yanikan's &quot;ability to deliberate and to premeditate his crime was demonstrated by his own testimony of the elaborate preparations pursuant to a plan which was executed with logic and precision. Defendant's testimony showed the plan was initiated many months prior to its execution and involved the use of a bait to lure the consular officials to the place chosen by defendant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;court&quot;/&gt; Despite objections from the [[Turkish government]], Yanikian was paroled on January 31, 1984 because of poor health, and transferred to a [[Montebello, California|Montebello]] [[convalescent]] hospital. He died of a [[heart attack]] one month later at the age of 88.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Paroled Assassin of Two Turkish Diplomats Dies.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'', February 29, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Yanikian is known to have remarked, &quot;I’m not Gourgen Yanikian but unacknowledged history coming back for the 1,500,000 Armenians whose bones desecrate my invisible existence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Der Mugurdechian, Barlow. &quot;Across the Chasm: From Catastrophe to Creativity&quot; in ''The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies'', ed. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In death, Yanikian became a symbol for many Armenians of their resentment toward the Turkish government for refusing to acknowledge the Armenian genocide.

Upon Yanikian's death, one of his attorneys, [[Bill Paparian]], remarked that he &quot;is now a piece of Armenian history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; 
	 
It is believed that Yanikian's act set off [[List of Turkish diplomats assassinated by Armenian militant organisations|the string of assassinations and targeted attacks against Turkish diplomats]] by [[ASALA]] and [[JCAG]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Yanikian would later be appropriated by ASALA as an iconic figure.&lt;ref name=rapo&gt;{{citation | last = Rapoport | first = David C | title = Terrorism | year = 2006 | pages= 44–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning, it bore the name of &quot;The Prisoner Kurken Yanikian Group&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Near East/South Asia Report | place = United States | publisher = Foreign Broadcast Information Service, Joint Publications Research Service | year = 1987 | page = 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this association, Yanikian's slayings have been characterized as &quot;the opening salvo&quot; of the armed attacks against the Turkish government and its agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Masih | first1 = Joseph R | last2= Krikorian | first2 = Robert O | title = Armenia: At the Crossroads |location = Amsterdam |publisher=Harwood Academic Publishers | year = 1999 | page = xxxi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Khachig Tololyan, &quot;[Yanikian is] not understood in the context of his life, of his real biography, or even in the context of the brief autobiography we can glean from his utterances. He is assigned a regulative biography, and understood through it... enlisted in a resonating roll-call that blurs history, context, and nuance.&quot;&lt;ref name =rapo /&gt;

==Cultural references==
There is a conversation between the Brano and Gavra from [[Olen Steinhauer]]'s ''Liberation Movements'' dedicated to Yanikian's person:&lt;br /&gt;
—&quot;Who's Gourgen Yanikian?&quot; Gavra asked.&lt;br /&gt;
—&quot;American citizen, Armenian descent. Two years ago he invited the Turkish consul general and the consul to lunch at the Baltimore Hotel in Santa Barbara, California. He shot them both with a Luger. Killed them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Liberation Movements | first = Olen | last = Steinhauer | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2007 | page = 43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, ''In My Defense'' play was staged in [[Glendale, California]]. Dedicated to Yanikian's life and struggle, the play is written by Jack Emery for the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlwattsartist.com/Gourgen_Yanikian_In_My_Defense.html Gourgen Yanikian: In My Defense, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grace Black''' is a fictional character from the British soap opera ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Tamara Wall]]. The character made her first on-screen appearance on 8 November 2013. Wall had three auditions for the role on the show's set in [[Liverpool]]. The character is introduced as the sister of [[Clare Devine]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]), who had been killed-off in earlier episodes. Grace arrives to investigate her death and get reacquainted with her estranged father [[Fraser Black]] ([[Jesse Birdsall]]).

Grace's characterisation initially played her as a ruthless gangster. The character received an extensive character development from ''Hollyoaks{{'}}'' executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] and his team. He believed he had let Wall down with Grace's original characterisation. Focusing on the character's personality and style, he and Wall transformed her from a gangster who fought for &quot;bags of money&quot; to a more family oriented woman fighting for &quot;love and loyalty&quot;. Production also created a unique style for the character with long acrylic nails and black suits. They later gave Grace a big [[bouffant]] hair style, that became a trademark of the character and gave her a bigger personality. Her introductory storyline focused on her damaged relationship with Fraser. He was soon killed off in a &quot;[[Whodunit]]&quot; storyline, which placed Grace as a main suspect. Writers also created a long-term relationship for Grace alongside [[Trevor Royle]] ([[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]]) and their relationship was centric to the character's storyline for three years. Grace gained a best friend in [[Esther Bloom]] (Jazmine Franks) and writers used the friendship to transform Grace into a more likeable character with viewers.

The character has been involved in many of the show's stories of her time. She has portrayed numerous kidnappings, fights, feuds and stunts. She has feuded with [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), [[Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]), [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]) and [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]). She has been pushed from a balcony, held hostage, shot, nearly killed Joe with a wrecking ball and has also been stalked by her lover [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]). Grace's plots have been both topical and dramatic – her relationship with Trevor and Esther explored the issue of surrogacy, while her affair with Kim culminated in a dramatic car crash stunt. In 2016, writers brought about the end of Grace's relationship with Trevor. They played him having an affair with [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) and later murdered by Sienna's daughter [[Nico Blake]] (Persephone Swales-Dawson) during his wedding to Grace. Producers then introduced Grace's extended family consisting of three half-brothers and her mother.

Wall has received four award nominations for her portrayal of Grace, including one &quot;Best Actress&quot; nomination at the 2016 [[Inside Soap Awards]]. The character has been generally well received by critics of the genre. Wall has received praise for her performances of grief and others branded the character &quot;ruthless&quot;.

==Casting==
Wall attended three auditions for the role. Her first was on the ''Hollyoaks'' set in [[Liverpool]], where she also acted out some scenes alongside regular cast members [[Jesse Birdsall]] and [[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]], who play [[Fraser Black]] and [[Trevor Royle]] respectively.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt; On 24 October 2013, Wall's casting as Grace was made public. The actress had already begun filming with ''Hollyoaks'' and a promotional image was released of her in character.&lt;ref name=casting/&gt; Grace was given immediate links with other characters in the show. She arrives wanting to investigate the death of her sister [[Clare Devine]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]). It was also revealed she would share screen time with her father Fraser and his bodyguard Trevor. The character made her first on-screen appearance on 8 November 2013.&lt;ref name=casting&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' unveils Clare Devine's sister Grace Black|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a525945/hollyoaks-unveils-clare-devines-sister-grace-black/|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterisation===

====Personality====
{{cquote|Grace Black is as strong as New Years Day coffee and she manages to turn heads wherever she goes. But don't be fooled – her smile is a mask and her perfectly manicured nails are claws in disguise (and are just as sharp)! Fierce, ruthless and dangerous – it's easy to see how Grace is the only gangster left standing in the Black family.|4=An excerpt from Grace's biography on the [[Channel 4]] website.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace Black (Tamara Wall)|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hollyoaks/profiles/all/grace-black-tamara-wall/625|website=[[Channel 4]]|publisher=([[Channel Four Television Corporation]])|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grace has been compared to a [[chameleon]] in her official character biography. This is because of her complex personality and differing attitudes depending on the type of characters that are sharing scenes with her.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Grace behaves in an aggressive manner, has a ruthless mentality and can be a dangerous character to be around. For instance Grace's customers and acquaintances sometimes view her as &quot;bubbly and warm&quot;. Though her close family and friends are more accustomed to a &quot;cold, hard-nosed and uncompromising&quot; nature – but the character does process a &quot;true soft side&quot;.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 2013, Wall told Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] that Grace is &quot;pretty rock hard&quot; and her childhood left her damaged emotionally. Fraser paid more attention to Clare and left Grace to fend for herself.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks actress Tamara Wall: 'Grace Black role gets darker'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a535739/hollyoaks-actress-tamara-wall-grace-black-role-gets-darker/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wall explained that &quot;she was the strong one and quite tomboy-ish. Grace now spends her whole life putting on a front that you don't ever mess with her. But behind closed doors, she secretly wants to be quite girly – although she'd never, ever show that!&quot; Grace enjoys being involved in a criminal life style.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt; She wants to prove to her father she can &quot;handle herself in a man's world&quot;. She likes to have power over other people and use it to her advantage. Wall has said that Grace is &quot;clever&quot;, &quot;two-faced&quot; and &quot;sly&quot; and different to her sister Clare.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt;

In July 2014, executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] announced that he had planned to change Grace's characterisation.&lt;ref name=dsprodint/&gt; He told Kilkelly that &quot;I acknowledge that we didn't get Grace's character right at first and I feel I let Tamara Wall down.&quot;&lt;ref name=kirkwoodinterview/&gt; He was pleased with Wall's performance as Grace and was eager to explore other aspects of the character's personality.&lt;ref name=dsprodint/&gt; Kirkwood's team put much work into further developing Grace and allowing Wall to bring warmth to her on-screen counterpart's persona.&lt;ref name=kirkwoodinterview/&gt; Writers used an existing character, [[Esther Bloom]] (Jazmine Franks) and made her Grace's best friend and &quot;very surprising sidekick&quot;. Kirkwood believed it would throw Grace into a non-criminal world and see her behave different, smile more, show a softer side and offer the audience a chance to witness &quot;other facets to her character.&quot;&lt;ref name=dsprodint&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks producer: 'Grace Black will show a softer side'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a584267/hollyoaks-producer-grace-black-will-show-a-softer-side/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkwood later reflected that the changes had given her family, friends and &quot;a great big beating heart&quot;. He remained committed to Grace doing bad deeds but hoped her development made the audience care about her more.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirkwoodinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks producer Bryan Kirkwood shares show gossip and teasers|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a610302/hollyoaks-producer-bryan-kirkwood-shares-show-gossip-and-teasers/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Writers played Grace trying to change her behaviour in preparation for motherhood. This added to the character's likeability with fans but Wall also wanted to keep Grace's dangerous side prevalent.&lt;ref name=series/&gt; She stated &quot;I like the fact that she’s more likeable now, but it’s much more fun playing her as a baddie. As long as I get to walk through the village with a buggy in one hand and a gun in the other – I’ll be happy!&quot;&lt;ref name=series&gt;{{cite web|title=Tamara Wall: Grace Black will be bad again|url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/11747253.Tamara_Wall__Grace_Black_will_be_bad_again/|website=[[Waltham Forest Guardian]]|publisher=([[Newsquest]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actress later reflected on Grace's transformation. She told Ellie Hooper from ''[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]]'' that Grace was a &quot;one dimensional&quot; character when she debuted. She observed a &quot;big old change&quot; and viewers could finally see her heart amongst the evil.&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview/&gt; She became friendlier as a result of mothering Curtis and writers ensured Grace had more comedy about her character. She dreams of a normal life even though it is not achievable for her given her past.&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview/&gt; She can be &quot;a little bit of a freak&quot; in her pursuit of the perfect family life, but ultimately Wall believed Grace would never get her &quot;happily ever after&quot;. Wall enjoyed the complexities of Grace, adding &quot;the best thing about her is that I still get to be the big evil baddie who’s not very nice, but at the same time, I get to be funny and I get to have a love story.&quot;&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hopper|first1=Ellie|title=Exclusive: Hollyoaks' Tamara Wall reveals what's next for the Gloved Hand Killer|url=http://lifestyle.one/closer/entertainment/soaps/exclusive-hollyoaks-tamara-wall-reveals-whats-next-gloved-hand-killer/|website=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]]|publisher=([[Bauer Media Group]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkwood later said that the newly family oriented Grace &quot;will be fighting for love and loyalty rather than bags of money.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: More gossip and teasers from show boss Bryan Kirkwood|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a610380/hollyoaks-more-gossip-and-teasers-from-show-boss-bryan-kirkwood/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her style changed and they introduced a new hairstyle, which has been described as an &quot;enormous bouffant hair-do&quot;.&lt;ref name=hairstyle/&gt; Wall was happy with the changes because it helped develop Grace.

====Backstory and introduction====
In the character's backstory, Fraser raised Grace and Clare as a single parent. He put his efforts into raising Clare, believing Grace was adapt to look after herself.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt; Their mother had walked out on them to escape Fraser's criminal life and started a new family.&lt;ref name=oaks/&gt; Fraser also raised Trevor but he had become romantically involved with Clare and got her pregnant. Grace secretly had feelings for Trevor too.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt; Grace and Clare did not get along with each other. When Clare died it made Grace reflect on the relationship and realise she loved her sister. But Grace is upset that she never told her how she felt. This is the main motive Grace has in wanting revenge against her killer.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt;

''Hollyoaks'' had a long-running theme of having a &quot;dark gangster corner of the show&quot; first created with the character [[Scott Anderson (Hollyoaks)|Scott Anderson]] ([[Daniel Hyde]]). Grace was brought into the show to fill that role of the gangster running The Loft night club.&lt;ref name=kirkwoodinterview/&gt; When Grace arrives in the village she is determined to find out the truth behind Clare's death. She knows [[Doctor Browning]] (Joseph Thompson) killed her sister in a [[hit and run]] incident and wants revenge. She notices [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) and [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) behaving suspiciously and begins to monitor them. She also confronts [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) about Clare. Grace does not realise the three characters are covering up the murder of Doctor Browning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks': Clare Devine's sister Grace arrives – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a528769/hollyoaks-clare-devines-sister-grace-arrives-spoiler-pictures/|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey becomes suspicious of Grace as soon as they meet. Austin told Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] that &quot;Grace is quite intimidating. Considering her relations, I don't think she's going to be the nicest of characters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' Sophie Austin interview: 'Lindsey is petrified'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a529360/hollyoaks-sophie-austin-interview-lindsey-is-petrified/|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has an problematic relationship with Fraser because she believes that he loved Clare more.&lt;ref name=casting/&gt; The show began to develop Grace's first feud storyline for Grace with Mercedes. When Mercedes receives Doctor Browning's life insurance money she flaunts her wealth in the village. This infuriates Grace and her hatred for Mercedes grows. She visits Trevor and makes it clear she intends to get revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Mercedes infuriates dangerous Grace – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a540169/hollyoaks-mercedes-infuriates-dangerous-grace-spoiler-pictures/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace's first feud with another gangster was quickly deployed on-screen. [[Ray McCormick]] ([[Cristian Solimeno]]) was introduced as an enemy of the Black family and targets Grace specifically. He kidnaps Grace, locks her away and demands ransom money in exchange for Grace's safety. Trevor becomes determined to secure her release and concocts a scam to steal Mercedes' money.&lt;ref name=solimeno&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=EastEnders wedding, Emmerdale fire, Hollyoaks kidnap, Corrie newcomer|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a538347/eastenders-wedding-emmerdale-fire-hollyoaks-kidnap-corrie-newcomer/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray then dresses as [[Father Christmas]] and attends Fraser's wedding to [[Sandy Roscoe]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]).

Writers soon escalated the feud into violence. Grace escapes and Trevor begins a scam selling counterfeit wine. Ray becomes annoyed with Trevor gaining more business and decides to vengefully target Grace once again.&lt;ref name=wine/&gt; She visits Clare's grave and Ray organises to have her badly beaten and left for dead. Fraser decides to convince Trevor that Ray killed his father. He knows Trevor will try and kill Ray as a result. A ''Hollyoaks'' publicist stated that &quot;all hell is set to break loose and these episodes are not to be missed.&quot;&lt;ref name=wine&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Susan|title=Hollyoaks: Grace Black battered by dad's enemy Ray beside sister's grave|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/368859/Hollyoaks-Grace-Black-battered-by-dad-s-enemy-Ray-beside-sister-s-grave|website=[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]|publisher=([[Northern &amp; Shell]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraser's lies and murder===
Grace's relationship with Fraser is made more complicated when he reveals that he has fathered a child with [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis).&lt;ref name=lomax/&gt; She decides to interfere with his personal life. Grace befriends Tegan who is initially wary of Grace. She pretends to want her half-sister, Rose, in her life to which Tegan agrees. She invites Tegan on a day out in the countryside. Grace then attempts to bribe Tegan with money to leave the village for good. Ellis told Kilkelly that her character is shocked by Grace's behaviour and refuses to leave.&lt;ref name=lomax/&gt; She added &quot;if there's an issue, it's one that Grace needs to sort out with her dad. Tegan isn't having any of it.&quot; This infuriates Grace who threatens her over the edge of a cliff. Ellis said that Tegan realises what Grace is capable of and is terrified of being killed. Ellis and Wall filmed the cliff-top scenes on a cold and rainy day. Wall was scared that she would accidentally push her co-star off the cliff.&lt;ref name=lomax&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks star Jessica Ellis on clifftop drama: 'Tegan is terrified'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a554584/hollyoaks-star-jessica-ellis-on-clifftop-drama-tegan-is-terrified/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hollyoaks'' created a &quot;[[Whodunit]]&quot; storyline in which Fraser is murdered. Viewers would be left guessing the identity of the killer in the episodes that followed. The show released a promotional video revealing the suspects. Grace and Trevor were amongst the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Marc|title=Who killed Fraser Black?

Fraser believed that they betrayed him and was considering having them killed. Tyler from ''Inside Soap'' reported that Grace realises she will be killed unless she take her own father out first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler|first1=Laura-Jayne|title=Who killed Fraser?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=19–25 April 2014|issue=15|pages=Laura-Jayne Who killed Fraser?|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy's son [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]) is determined to get Fraser out of the Roscoe family. He asks Trevor for help killing Fraser, who then brings Grace in on their plan. Grace is happy to oblige having fallen out with her father.&lt;ref name=limousine/&gt; Fraser and Sandy plan to travel by limousine to a special event. Grace, Trevor and Joe plan to lock Fraser in the vehicle and release poisonous gas to kill him. Grace betrays Joe and plans to frame him solely for the crime and also ensure Sandy dies too. The plot does go ahead but when Joe realises Sandy is in the limousine he rescues them from death.&lt;ref name=limousine&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fraser's death ride!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=12–18 April 2014|issue=14|pages=30|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser is later shot dead and Grace is genuinely angry and upset. She is left with Fraser's business and finances after his death. This makes other characters suspicious of her, believing she planned his murder for financial gain.&lt;ref name=aasinterview/&gt; Grace is a main suspect in the police investigation. Wall said &quot;right after Fraser is killed, Grace is on the warpath to try and blame someone for the crime.&quot; She wants to frame Tegan for the murder but later discovers a bag of clothes in Trevor's flat which leads her to believe he killed Fraser. Grace has him arrested, the actress reflected that it &quot;is awful, not only has she lost her dad, she's lost the love of her life.&quot;&lt;ref name=aasinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks' Tamara Wall on Fraser death: 'Grace tries to blame someone'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a563065/hollyoaks-tamara-wall-on-fraser-death-grace-tries-to-blame-someone/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor is released when Mercedes comes forward as his alibi, revealing they were having sex when Fraser was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Mercedes McQueen to blackmail Trevor Royle|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a582702/hollyoaks-mercedes-mcqueen-to-blackmail-trevor-royle/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace then becomes convinced [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) killed him.

===Wrecking ball stunt===
One of Grace's first big stories was announced in December 2013. Grace threatens Freddie telling him that she will harm someone close to him if he does not kill Mercedes for her. He refuses and Grace follows through with her plan. Kilkelly (Digital Spy) reported that ''Hollyoaks'' had created a dramatic stunt involving a [[wrecking ball]] and a demolition of their council housing set. They added that Grace would trap a character in the disused flats ready for them to be killed in the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks lines up shock wrecking ball stunt|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a540835/hollyoaks-lines-up-shock-wrecking-ball-stunt/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freddie's brother Joe was later revealed to be Grace's target. ''Hollyoaks'' released promotional pictures of the character being showered with debris from the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kikelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Grace Black's murder target confirmed – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a544144/hollyoaks-grace-blacks-murder-target-confirmed-spoiler-pictures/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Holloaks'' led viewers to believe that Joe had been killed off in the scenes. Fraser involved himself to ensure Grace was not reprimanded for the crime. He tells Grace that Joe died in the demolition and he disposed of the body.&lt;ref name=wreckballstunt/&gt; Writers played Grace being guilt ridden in the weeks of episodes that followed the stunt. Fraser decides to bring Grace in on a secret to ease her guilt. The show aired surprise scenes in which Fraser takes Grace to a private hospital where Joe is alive, but comatose and being cared for.&lt;ref name=wreckballstunt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Joe Roscoe still alive after council flats demolition|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a552470/hollyoaks-joe-roscoe-still-alive-after-council-flats-demolition/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and Fraser were tasked with keeping Joe's location a secret after everyone believes he left the village. Joe's mother Sandy nearly discovers the secret after Fraser is careless. Then Joe wakes from his coma and Grace considers killing Joe to protect her freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Grace and Fraser face panic over Joe Roscoe|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a559920/hollyoaks-grace-and-fraser-face-panic-over-joe-roscoe/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe fakes amnesia and manages to escape from hospital. It soon becomes clear he has not lost any memories from the incident. Callaghan told Laura-Jayne Tyler from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that &quot;he remembers pretty much everything that happened to him at the hands of Grace.&quot; He added that he wants to protect his mother Sandy, from the Black family now he knows about their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler|first1=Laura-Jayne|title=While Joe was 'dead', I was lazing about in my pants!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=5–11 April 2014|issue=13|pages=42–43|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace is arrested for the attempted murder of Joe and the case is sent to trial. Mercedes and Freddie become invested in watching Grace to make sure she does not get away with it.&lt;ref name=cash/&gt; Grace is confident she will be found not guilty at the trial. Writers played the story to convey Grace having similar power to Fraser. Wall told Laura Withers of ''Inside Soap'' that her character has the &quot;judge in her pocket&quot; and pays to fix the trial. She explained that Grace uses skills learned from her father. Fraser taught her that people in power can be paid off.&lt;ref name=cash/&gt; Mercedes discovers Grace's plan and attempts to ruin it. Wall claimed the story showed that Grace appears strong but is &quot;actually prettified&quot; about going to prison.

Grace has a prominent feud with the character Freddie Roscoe.&lt;ref name=feud&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Withers|first1=Laura|title=Fall for Grace!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=22–28 November 2014|issue=46|pages=14–15|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freddie manages to secure his release after he receives a false alibi. Grace knows the alibi is false and is furious that Freddie has evaded justice. Wall told Withers that &quot;Grace has been bent on revenge ever since she found out that Freddie killed her dad.&quot;&lt;ref name=feud/&gt; She was willing to forget her vendetta on the condition Freddie was sent to prison. But his release makes Grace &quot;see red&quot; and she wants a &quot;showdown&quot; with her nemesis. The actress said that at this point in the story Trevor is fed up with Grace and Freddie's feud. He issues an ultimatum that if she wants to start a family, she must leave Freddie alone.&lt;ref name=feud/&gt; Grace ignores Trevor's warnings and she goes to confront him at her night club where they brawl on the outside balcony. Writers included a &quot;deadly turn&quot; in the story, where there fight escalates and Freddie knocks Grace over the balcony and she falls to the ground. Wall said that writers made in unclear to her whether Freddie did it intentionally or accidentally, but noted &quot;it would certainly make life easier for Freddie if Grace were dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=feud/&gt; ''Hollyoaks'' hired a stunt double during filming as they could not expect Wall to perform a 12-foot fall.&lt;ref name=wallfallinterview/&gt;

Grace has to become secretive about her revenge plans as not to upset Trevor who wants a normal family life. Wall commented &quot;It's a bit of a tough situation for Grace, because she's stuck in the middle. She could either be the baddie and get revenge, or she could turn her back, let bygones be bygones and be a family woman.&quot;&lt;ref name=wallfallinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks' Tamara Wall: 'Grace wants revenge against Freddie'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a611974/hollyoaks-tamara-wall-grace-wants-revenge-against-freddie/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace decides on a new revenge plot against Freddie. Mercedes disappears in mysterious circumstances and the police believe she has been murdered when they find traces of her blood. Flashback scenes aired revealed Grace was behind Mercedes' disappearance and she sets out to frame Freddie for her murder.

===Relationship with Trevor Royle===
''Hollyoaks'' created Grace's first relationship storyline alongside Trevor. The plot commenced on-screen December 2013 when the duo kissed for the first time. Grace becomes jealous of Trevor charming Mercedes in his attempts to con her. When Trevor confronts her jealous behaviour Grace admits she has romantic feelings for him and they get together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Hollyoaks: Trevor Royle, Grace Black share kiss – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a535421/hollyoaks-trevor-royle-grace-black-share-kiss-spoiler-pictures/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and Trevor's relationship is forbidden by disapproving Fraser, and they see each other in secret. Freddie discovers their romance and tells Fraser about their betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Grace and Trevor caught out by Freddie – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a541791/hollyoaks-grace-and-trevor-caught-out-by-freddie-spoiler-pictures/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) that it is love between Grace and Trevor &quot;but in this murky world that they live in, they're not being able to fully express that love.&quot; He said that it was a difficult situation for his character.&lt;ref name=lomaxdeal/&gt; He wants to keep out of prison so he can be with her. Wood described the relationship as a first for Trevor because he deeply cares and loves Grace unlike his previous romances.&lt;ref name=lomaxdeal&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Greg Wood talks Trevor Royle's shock police decision|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a546900/hollyoaks-greg-wood-talks-trevor-royles-shock-police-decision/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall hoped that Grace and Trevor would become the show's &quot;new power couple&quot;. She wanted them to have a similar relationship to [[Den Watts|Den]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]), a well known married couple from the rival soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''.&lt;ref name=denangie/&gt; Though she noted &quot;Grace and Trevor are far more evil&quot;, her character believes her relationship is &quot;the real deal&quot; and Trevor is the only man she cares about. Grace's influence on Trevor is positive and allowed writers to showcase his &quot;soft side&quot;.&lt;ref name=denangie/&gt; When sharing scenes the pair can be shown as quite pleasant characters, Wall said it &quot;it makes them more likeable, even though they are both baddies.&quot; Fans of ''Hollyoaks'' labelled the couple &quot;Trace&quot; and the actress believed the relationship helped viewers warm to her character.&lt;ref name=denangie&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLennan|first1=Patrick|title=Hollyoaks’ Tamara: ‘I hope we become the Den and Angie of Chester!’|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/hollyoaks/hollyoaks-news/hollyoaks-tamara-i-hope-we-become-the-den-and-angie-of-chester-120785/|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[Time Inc. UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wood his character had long hankered for a sense of normality that other characters on the show have. He said that finding love had changed his character's priorities. Grace had become Trevor's main focus and the gangster business played second.&lt;ref name=woodinterview/&gt; In one story, Grace has Trevor arrested for her father's murder. Wood believed that Trevor was understanding of the betrayal because she was grieving. He added that Trevor's understanding was the reason they were able to move on in their relationship.&lt;ref name=woodinterview/&gt;

Grace wants to begin a family but her doctor informs her the chances are low because of injuries sustained by a gun shot. She decides to try [[IVF]] treatment in order to conceive.&lt;ref name=bigbobarrives/&gt; She tells Trevor she wants to focus on a future that does not involve crime. Wall told an ''Inside Soap'' reporter that &quot;Grace doesn't want to be evil any more.&quot; She noted that Trevor had long wanted to change but Grace was &quot;more stubborn about it&quot;. When Grace announced her intention to have IVF, Trevor is delighted. Wall said it was a &quot;cute&quot; moment for the couple because they are so happy.&lt;ref name=bigbobarrives/&gt;

In 2015, producers built Grace and Trevor's family unit by introducing his son [[Dylan Jenkins]] (James Fletcher). His arrival sends their lives into disarray but Grace does try and make an effort with him. She agrees to go to his school parents evening, but dresses inappropriately. In comedic scenes Dylan is embarrassed by Grace's revealing outfit which attracts the attention of male students who begin wolf-whistling at her. Wall said &quot;lets face it, Grace and Trevor are not your average parents, are they?&quot;&lt;ref name=hairstylequote/&gt;

Writers plagued the duo with more relationship dramas such as Grace's affair with Kim and the introduction of Trevor's ex-girlfriend and Dylan's mother, [[Val Jenkins]] (Tanya Robb). When Grace makes a harsh comment regarding the death of Phoebe, Trevor is furious and they argue. Val uses the opportunity to spend time with Trevor helping him with house work. This makes Grace jealous, who views Val as a love-rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks death to spark tension between Grace and Trevor|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a653215/hollyoaks-death-to-spark-tension-between-grace-and-trevor/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace's concerns are proved correct Val kisses Trevor. Robb told an ''Inside Soap'' reporter that Val wants to give Dylan a &quot;normal family life&quot;. She believed her character did not want to ruin Grace's relationship but thought it felt natural to try. Trevor does not reciprocate but Grace finds evidence of their kiss and it causes more problems for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Val kisses Trevor!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=13–19 June 2015|issue=23|pages=26|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also face another set back when Grace wrongly presumes Trevor has slept with [[Porsche McQueen]] ([[Twinnie-Lee Moore]]). Grace forces Trevor to take a lie detector test to prove his innocence. Wall said it was an example of her character behaving anxiously because she is about to achieve her dreams of a complete family. She does not want Trevor to ruin it by cheating, Wall added &quot;She's probably quite worried all the time that he's going to go off with some beautiful, normal girl.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Naomi|last1=Harris|title=Take the lie detector test!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=14–20 March 2015|issue=10|pages=12–13|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trevor is arrested for a series of murders which occurred at the local hospital. He is wrongly accused as viewers knew that Lindsey was the serial killer, dubbed the &quot;Gloved Hand Killer&quot;.&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview/&gt; Wall said her character knows Trevor better than anyone and knows he would not have committed these crimes. She sets out to prove his innocence but Lindsey is actively trying to frame Trevor. Wall likened Grace trying to complete a puzzle as she goes out to find clues that lead to the actual killer. Grace realises that Charlie Dean (Charlie Behan) knows something about the actual culprit. Wall said that Grace is true to form and behaves &quot;very aggressive&quot;, kidnaps him and tries to force Charlie to talk.&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview/&gt;

===Feud with Big Bob===
''Hollyoaks'' cast [[Vincent Ebrahim]] to play [[Big Bob]], a villainous character created to cause conflict with Grace and Trevor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klompus|first1=Jack|title=The Kumars actor Vincent Ebrahim joins Hollyoaks as villain|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a582066/the-kumars-actor-vincent-ebrahim-joins-hollyoaks-as-villain/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Bob arrives in the village to find Trevor and request a criminal favour.

A ''Hollyoaks'' publicist stated that it was &quot;more than just bad luck&quot; and warned that Grace has a bad track record with guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Sarah|title=Grace held hostage!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=13–19 September 2014|issue=36|pages=17|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esther Bloom friendship and surrogacy===
[[File:Jazmine Franks.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Jazmine Franks (''pictured'') plays Grace's best friend Esther Bloom.]]
After the siege Grace and Esther build a strong friendship. It was the relationship writers used to develop Grace's softer side.&lt;ref name=dsprodint/&gt; Wall viewed Grace and Esther's friendship as a completely &quot;random&quot; but &quot;brilliant&quot; pairing. She was happy with the progression of their friendly dynamic, which resulted in the two characters always looking after one another. The actress also believed it made both characters' stories take a &quot;perfect&quot; path. She also enjoyed working on the relationship because of Franks' funny personality.&lt;ref name=wallfallinterview/&gt;

Grace is told she cannot get pregnant and IVF is unlikely to help. She then shows an interest in Esther's health and her sudden concern makes Esther suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Hollyoaks spoiler pictures: Grace and Trevor face new baby setback|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a599837/hollyoaks-spoiler-pictures-grace-and-trevor-face-new-baby-setback/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace asks Esther to be a surrogate mother for her and tries to bully her into helping. When Grace leaves Esther alone she agrees to help.&lt;ref name=jazinterview/&gt; Grace, Trevor and Esther attend a meeting at the hospital to discuss their plans. The doctor informs Grace that Esther would be the child's legal mother, despite using Grace's egg. Grace is not fazed but Trevor has some reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks spoiler pictures: Esther attends surrogacy appointment|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a603933/hollyoaks-spoiler-pictures-esther-attends-surrogacy-appointment/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surrogacy plan is successful and Esther becomes pregnant.&lt;ref name=hairstylequote/&gt; Franks was surprised when producers pitched the storyline to her. She was happy to be trusted with the story and added that Esther is &quot;too nice&quot; and ultimately could not refuse to help Grace. The actress believed viewers that would have never imagined the three characters working together.&lt;ref name=jazinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks' Jazmine Franks: 'I'm over the moon with surrogacy plot'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a603437/hollyoaks-jazmine-franks-im-over-the-moon-with-surrogacy-plot/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers played scenes which sometimes threatened Grace's happiness. Early on in the pregnancy they created a medical scare for Esther. When she feels unwell Grace worries and rushes Esther to hospital.&lt;ref name=hairstylequote/&gt; But after a check-up and scan the pregnancy is fine. Grace and Trevor witness Esther's ultrasound scan and see their baby for the first time. Wall said &quot;it's lovely, it hits them that they're really going to have a child! There aren't very many warm moments in Grace and Trevor's lives, but this is definitely one of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=hairstylequote/&gt;

Writers began developing a new romance for Esther while she carried Grace's child. Esther meets [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]) who asks her on a date. Esther invites Grace along and Kim presumes they are in a relationship. Grace is privy to their misunderstanding and urges them to get together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks spoiler pictures: Esther's new romance plot begins|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a606449/hollyoaks-spoiler-pictures-esthers-new-romance-plot-begins/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Spy's Kilkelly revealed that Grace would soon regret her decision.

She explained that Esther always knew the baby was for Grace but she has an unforeseen attachment to Curtis. Esther feels maternal to the baby and she had not expected it to happen when she first agreed to be a surrogate for Grace. Franks added that &quot;she's scared that Trevor and Grace are not fit parents.&quot;&lt;ref name=fr/&gt;

===Kim Butterfield's obsession===
Producers created an infidelity story for Grace with Kim. Kate Thomas from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Grace and Kim would share a kiss and the latter Kim then develop an &quot;unhealthy obsession&quot; with Grace.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Kate|title=Spoiler alert: Hollyoaks' Kim and Grace share a kiss while Mercedes makes a sensational comeback in dramatic Spring trailer|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3018372/Mercedes-makes-sensational-comeback-dramatic-Hollyoaks-Spring-trailer.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[DMG Media]])|accessdate=13 August 2016|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A promotional trailer followed which showcased Kim's behaviour intensifying when she begins a diary about her interaction with Grace.

Grace is sent to prison awaiting trial for her involvement in the supposed murder of Mercedes. Wall explained that her character refused to tell the truth about Mercedes being alive.

So when she enters prison she schemes against Grace's cell mate [[Reenie McQueen]] ([[Zöe Lucker]]), resulting in Kim being moved into Grace's cell. Wood-Davis said that it marked the first time Grace became unnerved by Kim's behaviour.&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Carena|title=Grace lights a fire in Kim that gets her heart racing!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|date=25 April – 8 May 2015|issue=347|pages=36, 37|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood-Davis viewed Kim and Grace as an &quot;odd pairing and very unexpected&quot; who bonded over their shared love of Esther. Grace is scared at the prospect of permanent imprisonment and feels vulnerable. She opens up to Kim about her deteriorating relationship with Trevor because she is someone familiar. But Kim uses this as an opportunity to seduce Grace who responds positively and the pair have sex. The development lead writers to play the Kim character even crazier over Grace, thinking she and Grace will be together upon their release from prison. Wood-Davis said Kim thinks &quot;she's found a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.&quot;&lt;ref name=ab/&gt; Wall told Sally Brockway from ''[[Soaplife]]'' Grace does not realise &quot;how insane Kim is&quot;.

This allowed the actors to act as though they were driving the vihicle despite the stunt man being in control.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; The car which contains Kim and Esther was crashed using a police van which collides with it. The car crash stunt itself was filmed separate and actors were not required to be in the vehicles at that point.&lt;ref name=stunt/&gt; Real fire, smoke, fire engines and fire fighters were included in the scenes to help create an authentic scene of mayhem during the post-crash scenes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3952">'''Grace Marks''' (c. 1828 – after c. 1873) was a [[Province of Canada|Canadian]] [[maid]] who was convicted in 1843 of murder in the death of her employer Thomas Kinnear, and was suspected of murdering his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. Her conviction was controversial, and sparked much debate about whether Marks was actually instrumental in the murder, or merely an unwitting accessory.

Marks was born and raised in Ulster, [[Ireland]], had eight siblings, with another three who were stillborn. Marks' father, a stonemason, was an alcoholic and abusive person. The family emigrated to Canada in 1840 when she was 12. Her mother died on the ship en route to Canada, and was buried at sea.

In her murder trial, Marks was tried alongside James McDermott, Kinnear's stable hand. They were tried for the murder of Kinnear, and the trial for Montgomery's murder was to follow but was seen as unnecessary, as both were sentenced to death.  Marks was initially committed to an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] but was later transferred to [[Kingston Penitentiary]], while McDermott was [[hanging|hanged]]. After almost thirty years of incarceration, Marks was pardoned and moved to Northern [[New York (state)|New York]]. After that, all trace of her was lost.

What is known of Marks on the historical record comes primarily from [[Susanna Moodie]]'s book ''Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush''.

In 1996, author [[Margaret Atwood]] published a novel about Marks, ''[[Alias Grace]]''. In that novel's reviews, several critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-18714174/amazing-atwood|title=Amazing Atwood|date=March 29, 2003|accessdate=September 23, 1996|work=[[Maclean's]]|first=Diane|last=Turbide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/647611941.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+29%2C+2003&amp;author=Daphne+Gordon&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Murderers+not+created+equal+%3B+Women+who+kill+capture+popular+imagination+Otherwise+heinous+crime+becomes+a+laughing+matter&amp;pqatl=google|title=Murderers not created equal|date=March 29, 2003|accessdate=February 18, 2013|work=[[Toronto Star]]|first=Daphne|last=Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out eerie similarities between Marks and a more recently controversial Canadian murder convict, [[Karla Homolka]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6815">'''Grady Franklin Stiles, Jr.''' (June 26, 1937 – November 29, 1992) was a [[freak show]] performer. His [[deformity]] was [[ectrodactyly]], in which the fingers and toes are fused together to form claw-like extremities. Stiles' stage name was the &quot;'''Lobster Boy'''&quot;.

==Family history==

The Stiles family had a long history of [[ectrodactyly]]. Stiles was the sixth in a line that began with the birth of William Stiles in 1805. Grady Stiles' father was a sideshow attraction in a [[traveling carnival]] when his son was born and added him to the act at a young age.&lt;ref name=&quot;thehumanmarvels.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehumanmarvels.com/?p=66|title=Grady Stiles Jr. – The Murderous Lobster Man |last=Pednaud |first=J. Tithonus |work=The Human Marvels |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiles married twice and had four children, two of whom also had ectrodactyly. Stiles and his two children toured together as The Lobster Family. When not traveling with the carnival the Stiles family lived in [[Gibsonton, Florida]] where many other carnival performers lived during the winter season.

==Murder==

Stiles was an alcoholic and was abusive to his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;thehumanmarvels.com&quot;/&gt; Due to his ectrodactyly, he was unable to walk. While he often used a wheelchair, he most commonly used his hands and arms for locomotion. He developed substantial upper body strength that, when combined with his bad temper and alcoholism, made him dangerous to others.

In 1978 in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], Stiles shot and killed his oldest daughter's fiancé on the eve of their wedding. He was brought to trial, where he openly confessed to killing the man and was convicted of third degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Fred |year=1995 |title=Lobster Boy |publisher=Pinnacle Books |page=134 |isbn=0-7860-0133-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LkwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5039,2908086&amp;dq=stiles+murder&amp;hl=en |title='Lobster Man' Guilty In Kin's Fiance Death |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |first=Gabriel |last=Ireton |date=February 23, 1979 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not sent to prison as no state institution was equipped to care for an inmate with ectrodactyly. Stiles was instead sentenced to fifteen years [[probation]].

Stiles stopped drinking thereafter, and during this period remarried his first wife, Mary Teresa (Teresa).  However, he soon began drinking again and his family claimed that he became even more abusive. In 1992, Teresa and her son from a previous marriage, Harry Glenn Newman Jr., hired a seventeen-year-old sideshow performer named Chris Wyant to kill Stiles for $1500.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, pp. 166–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyant was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to 27 years in prison. Harry Newman was given life in prison for his role as the mastermind and Teresa was given 12 years in prison for conspiracy to commit murder.

Stiles' son, Grady Stiles III, disputes the claim that Teresa had him murdered. According to him, his mother, Teresa, and father were arguing. Teresa had said 'Something needs to be done.' Teresa's son overheard this, and went to a neighbor and repeated it. The neighbor shot and killed Stiles shortly after.&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moye|first1=David|title=Son Of Lobster Boy Discusses Dad's Grisly Murder On 'Freakshow'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/17/lobster-boy-_n_5340346.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

[[Fred Rosen (author)|Fred Rosen]] wrote a book on the case called ''Lobster Boy: The Bizarre Life and Brutal Death of Grady Stiles Jr.'', and [[E!]] made a ''[[True Hollywood Stories]]'' episode based on the case titled &quot;The Murder of Lobster Boy&quot;. [[A&amp;E Network]] also made a ''[[City Confidential]]'' episode based on the case called &quot;Gibsonton: The Last [[Side Show]]&quot;.

Stiles' likeness appears on the CD cover for [[Silverchair]]'s ''[[Freak Show (album)|Freak Show]]''.

A person like Grady, going by the name of &quot;Lobster Boy&quot;, appears in a [[Deadpool]] comic. Deadpool was hired to assassinate him, but fails when he figures out he is possessed by [[Xaphan]], a fallen angel, and starts possessing the souls. He was later saved by the two [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]s, but at the end is shot again in the head by Deadpool for being cruel to other freaks.&lt;ref&gt;Deadpool Team-Up#897&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[HBO|HBO's]] ''[[Carnivàle]]'', set on a [[traveling carnival]] during the [[Great Depression]], the central character, [[Ben Hawkins (Carnivàle)|Ben Hawkins]], is sent out by his employers to investigate rumors of ''Lobster Girl'' in a nearby town.

''American Freakshow: The Terrible Tale of Sloth Boy,'' a graphic novel published by [[IDW Publishing]], tells the tale of Dante Browning, a carnival sideshow performer with clawed hands who, because of his abuse and cruelty to his family, is shot to death by a hit man hired by his wife and stepson while in his home in [[Gibsonton, Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;idwpublishing&quot;&gt;http://www.idwpublishing.com/catalog/series/321&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]'' has a Lobster Boy character.  It also includes a small statue in the likeness of Stiles in the opening credits. In addition, a snapshot of Stiles is briefly seen at the American Morbidity Museum in the third episode (&quot;[[Edward Mordrake, Part I]]&quot;).

[[John_Strohm_(musician)|John Strohm]] wrote &quot;Ballad of Lobster Boy,&quot; inspired by Grady Stiles and recorded the song for his 1999 album Vestavia.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic Review of Vestavia&quot;&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/vestavia-mw0000048384&lt;/ref&gt;

The Last Podcast on the Left had an episode on &quot;The Lobster Boy&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11788">'''Graeme Burton''' is a [[New Zealander]] who murdered two people in two separate incidents fourteen years apart. The second murder occurred six months after he was released on [[parole]] in 2006. This led to increased public concern about the release of high risk offenders on parole and to internal reviews by the Probation Service and the [[New Zealand Parole Board]] of their decision-making and management processes.

== Early years ==
Burton was adopted as a baby by an older couple. Burton was described as an artistic and polite child, who went off the rails after his adoptive father died when Burton was in his teens.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt; This left his foster mother to raise him on her own. It seems she struggled to cope and was very critical of Burton as he was growing up. If he misbehaved, she would remind him he was adopted and threaten to give him back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beyondthe&quot;&gt;&quot;Graeme Burton&quot;. ''Beyond the Darklands'', Series 2, Episode 6, TVNZ, Broadcast 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of put downs and constant criticism, Burton grew up feeling insecure and angry, with little sense of attachment to his adopted mother. He began using drugs at the age of 15.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10418894 ‘The freedom gamble’], NZ Herald, 13 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The TVNZ documentary ''[[Beyond the Darklands (New Zealand TV series)|Beyond the Darklands]]'' documented Burton’s increasing abuse of drugs as a teenager and, in particular, highlighted his use of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], alcohol and prescription pills. From the age of 17, he was using drugs on an almost daily basis. His girlfriend who was interviewed for the documentary said he used to break into chemist shops to get [[benzodiazepine]]s and committed burglaries to get money for drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beyondthe&quot;/&gt; By the time he was 21, he had 91 convictions for property, fraud and other drug-related crimes.

== Murder of Paul Anderson ==
Burton’s frustrations came to a head in 1992 after he was refused entry to a Wellington nightclub. He took his resentment and rage out on Paul Anderson, a lighting technician at the club, stabbing him to death in an alcohol and drug fuelled frenzy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} He was under the influence of six different drugs at the time.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt; A friend said he witnessed Burton taking 8 to 10 [[Triazolam|Halcion]] tablets (a benzodiazapine) and a couple of trips (LSD) in the hours before the murder and said he had been drinking &quot;tequila slammers&quot; all evening. This chemical cocktail turned out to be a recipe for disaster.

Burton was sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in New Zealand|life imprisonment]] and continued using drugs in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10419035 ‘Judge says Burton was not 'bad' but drugs to blame’], NZ Herald, 14 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, Burton and three other offenders escaped from [[Paremoremo Prison]], sparking a manhunt involving more than 100 police. He was sentenced to three years' prison for the escape and associated crimes.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt;

== Parole Board decision to release ==

Burton spent 14 years in prison from 1992 to 2006. He returned a number of positive drug tests in prison but managed to avoid positive tests in the last three years before he was paroled. He participated in the violence prevention programme after the [[New Zealand Parole Board]] regarded him in 2004 as &quot;at high risk of re-offending if released&quot;. In September 2005 he was denied parole again because, through no fault of his own, the board's earlier recommendation that the Corrections Department arrange temporary escorted releases to test his conduct away from prison was not fulfilled.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt; However, the board was impressed by information that indicated apparent progress, in particular that &quot;in the last two years his conduct has been described as impeccable&quot;. But it wanted one more psychological assessment done on him.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt;

The board's decision to release Burton was made at a hearing in June 2006, and it ordered his release on 10 July. The final psychological assessment had been done and concluded: &quot;Mr Burton's documented improvement in conduct and release plan supports a case for a carefully managed release under close supervision.&quot; The decision to parole him was made despite the Department's failure to meet the board's request that Burton be eased back into the community by a process of home leaves. The Board also decided it would be unfair to hold against him an unsubstantiated allegation related to an alleged incident in prison, because there was no documentation to confirm whether it had occurred.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt;

Burton was released into the care of his biological mother, whom he barely knew; he had met her about 12 times in the 14 years he had been in prison.&lt;ref name=getting_guns&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10427384 Burton case: 'I was getting guns for a final shootout'] ''New Zealand Herald'', 7 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She had been living in Australia for some years but agreed to come back to New Zealand for one month to assist Burton's &quot;reintegration&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beyondthe&quot; /&gt; His adoptive mother had died of cancer in 1999.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt;

== Murder of Karl Kuchenbecker ==
His mother went back to Australia and Burton spent the next few months using stand-over tactics and assaulting drug dealers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald_c&quot;&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10479384 ‘Police knew Burton was robbing drug dealers’]. ''The New Zealand Herald''. 1 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to media reports, the police were fully aware that he was buying methamphetamine but failed to act. Police allege that on 3 January 2007 Burton attacked a man in an apartment near his own Tory Street home. A day later a cache of weapons was found at Burton's home.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt; On 5 January he was involved in a home invasion in Lower Hutt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police search hills for victims as Burton captured |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10417991 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He killed Karl Kuchenbecker on 6 January in the hills of Wainuiomata.&lt;ref name=freedom_gamble/&gt; Burton also fired at several other mountain bikers before levelling his shotgun at the police. The police fired first, hitting Burton in the leg, which was subsequently amputated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10478557 Parole Board kept in dark over the 'real' Burton]. ''The New Zealand Herald''. 27 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, his drug-fuelled rampage lasted six months.

When Burton was asked to give his account of what happened he said he did not want to go back to prison and hoped he would be killed: &quot;I saw the police and thought, 'It's over'. I was happy. I ran at them smiling, thinking, 'It's over, thank God it's over'. The police shot me and I was hit in the artery in my leg. I thought I'd bleed out. I surrendered as I thought death was certain. Unfortunately, that was not the case, much to my disgust, as I wanted to be killed. I was gutted that I wasn't killed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10427392 Burton: I was gutted I wasn't killed]. ''The New Zealand Herald''. 7 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton pleaded guilty to 11 charges relating to the events of 6 January. The charges were one of murder, two of attempted murder, two of aggravated robbery, two of kidnapping, two of using a firearm against a law enforcement officer, aggravated injury and injuring with reckless disregard. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 26 years for the murder. For the other, lesser charges he was sentenced to preventive detention with a non-parole period of 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Independent Police Conduct Authority Report into the Shooting of Graeme Burton |date=2008 |url=http://www.ipca.govt.nz/includes/download.aspx?ID=101413 |location=Wellington |publisher=Independent Police Conduct Authority |page=45 |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parole Board inquiry ==

The Parole Board and the Corrections Department conducted separate inquiries into what went wrong. The Parole Board’s decision making was reviewed by James Ogloff, professor of forensic psychology at Monash University in Australia, and New Zealand’s Chief District Court Judge, Russell Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Review of New Zealand Parole Board Decision to Release Graeme William Burton on Parole. Judge R J Johnson, Chief District Court Judge, New Zealand; Professor J Ogloff, Monash University &amp; Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health, Melbourne, 5/3/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corrections Department inquiry ==
Corrections examined its handling of the Burton case and also found some serious mistakes. Burton broke his parole conditions for the first time on 5 December 2006, when he phoned his probation officer instead of meeting him, but the probation officer took no action. He subsequently failed to report at all. Corrections did not lodge a complaint with police until 19 December, a week after Burton failed to report and two weeks after his first breach. Coroner Garry Evans found Burton had breached his parole conditions six times in the few months he was on the loose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10517304 Editorial: Right to sue long overdue], NZ Herald 20 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In his final report on Mr Kuchenbecker's death, Mr Evans said: &quot;Fundamentally, Burton was treated as a normal parolee ... when, in fact, he was a high-risk, high-profile parolee, registered on the department's Offender Warning System, who required close monitoring for early signs of relapse and the taking of immediate and effective action on presentation of such signs ... &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10557316 Burton case the catalyst for scrutiny of Corrections], NZ Herald 18 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Police also knew of several incidents where Burton robbed and beat up drug dealers towards the end of November 2006, but declined to use the information to get him recalled to prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald_c&quot; /&gt;

== Later years ==
In December 2008, Burton was involved in another violent incident – this time in Auckland's maximum security Paremoremo Prison. He stabbed Headhunters gang member Dwayne Marsh through the heart and in the shoulders, arms and legs with a sharpened steel rod. Marsh who was rushed to Auckland Hospital's emergency department by ambulance and placed in the Intensive Care Unit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10549112 Burton attacks prisoner], NZ Herald 21 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and Burton was subsequently convicted of attempted murder. Then in 2010 prison officers were placed under investigation after a knife was found in Burton's cell. A source told the ''Herald on Sunday'' that officers had been failing to make daily cell searches and the homemade pocketknife was discovered hidden inside a fan in his cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10662762 Dangerous prisoner had knife] ''New Zealand Herald'', 1 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graham Clark''' is a fictional character from the British soap opera ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Kevin Pallister]]. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 August 1998.

==Creation and casting==
In early August 1998, Steven Murphy of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' reported that [[Rachel Hughes]] ([[Glenda McKay]]) would gain a new love interest in the form of &quot;a handsome teacher&quot; called Graham.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Steven|date=8–21 August 1998|title=A Dale of a time|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=Attic Futura (UK) Ltd|issue=107|page=8|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy said &quot;But in traditional soap style, all isn't going to exactly to plan with the budding romance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;/&gt;

==Storylines==
Graham is a local schoolteacher who looks around Keeper's Cottage after [[Lady Tara Oakwell]] evicts [[Seth Armstrong]] and [[Betty Eagleton]]. When he discovers the reason for the sale, he refuses to buy it. He began dating Rachel Hughes. Graham at first appeared to be a perfect boyfriend for Rachel. He moved in with her and redecorated her home, cooked and even alphabetised her CD collection. But gradually Graham began to take control of Rachel's life. He got her to dress differently and die her hair auburn so that she resembled his dead wife. Graham later took Rachel for a walk in the countryside and Rachel realised that Graham had an overwhelming desire to control every woman he dated. Rachel tried to escape but Graham tried to force himself on her and she fled away in fear until Graham trapped her on a clifftop. After a short talk, Rachel realised Graham had murdered his wife and made it look like she had committed suicide. Graham then pushed Rachel off the cliff and killed her.

He later went to the police station and reported Rachel missing and joined the search to find her to avoid suspicion. When he arrived at the place where she had fallen, Graham pretended to have just come across her body to divert suspicion away from him.

Graham pretended to be grief-stricken and told [[Eric Pollard]] that Rachel had accepted his marriage proposal to her. But Eric had spoken to Rachel the day before her death and knew that she had been thinking of ending her relationship with Graham. Eric was suspicious of Graham and, believing he had killed Rachel, he tried to find incrimination evidence against Graham but was unsuccessful.

After Rachel's death Graham moved on to her friend [[Kathy Brookman|Kathy Glover]]. Kathy had been engaged to [[Biff Fowler]] but Biff was convinced that Kathy was attracted to Graham. In an attempt to break up their relationship Graham actively encouraged Biff to think that there was an attraction between them. Finally on his and Kathy's wedding day Biff saw that Kathy was watching out for Graham to arrive and he decided that as she wasn't committed to him he jilted her at the altar and rode off on his motorbike.

With Biff gone Graham could start a relationship with Kathy and they later planned to marry. When Eric accused Graham of murdering Rachel, he left the village with Kathy and took her on a romantic weekend away.

While driving with Graham it became clear to Kathy that there was something wrong with Graham and when he realised her suspicions he tried to gain control of the car but it went off the road and teetered on a cliff edge before finally falling over the edge. The car ended up bursting into flames when it landed on the [[beach]] and Graham was killed. Kathy managed to get out of the car in the last second and was helped up the cliff by Eric and [[Marlon Dingle]] who had been in pursuit.

'''Graham Stuart Stafford''' (born 21 May 1963) is a British sheet metal worker from [[Goodna, Queensland|Goodna]], near [[Ipswich, Queensland]] who was convicted in 1992 of the murder of twelve-year-old Leanne Sarah Holland, born 1 October 1978. Leanne Holland, the younger sister of Stafford's former partner, Melissa Holland, was murdered in September 1991. Her viciously mutilated body was found three days after she was reported missing in nearby [[Redbank Plains, Queensland|Redbank Plains]]. It is possible she was also sexually interfered with and tortured with a cigarette lighter.

Stafford appealed to the [[Queensland Court of Appeal]], but this appeal was rejected on 25 August 1992. In 1997, the Queensland Court of Appeal re-examined the case after Stafford lodged an application for pardon with the State Governor on the basis of evidence gathered by private detective, Graeme Crowley. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal again by a two-to-one majority on the grounds that there was still enough evidence to convict. Two applications for special leave to the [[High Court of Australia]] subsequently failed.

Stafford was released in June 2006 after serving over 14 years in prison. Stafford, who was born in England and does not have Australian citizenship despite having migrated to Australia in 1969, faced deportation in November 2006.

Some people, including [[Paul Wilson (criminologist)|Professor Paul Wilson]] of [[Bond University]] believe that Stafford is a victim of a [[miscarriage of justice]]. The Queensland Attorney-General, [[Kerry Shine]], has agreed to closely consider any request on Stafford's behalf concerning a petition to clear him of the murder conviction. In April 2008, the Queensland Attorney-General referred the case to the Court of Appeal for a very rare second appeal for pardon. 

On 24 December 2009 the Court of Appeal overturned Graham Stafford's conviction and ordered a retrial by a 2-1 majority. The dissenting judge wanted an immediate acquittal. On 26 March 2010 the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions, Tony Moynihan SC announced there would be no new trial of Graham Stafford for the murder of Leanne Holland.

==Evidence leading to conviction==
The judgment in the 1992 appeal set out the following evidence relied on by the crown which led to the conviction.
* During the day on which the Crown claims Leanne was murdered, Leanne and Stafford were alone in the home they both lived in with Leanne's father and sister.
* Blood of a rare type was found on several items in the boot of Stafford's car. The blood type was shown to be of the same type as Leanne's.
* A strand of hair was also found in the car boot which was of similar length, colour and texture as Leanne's.
* A maggot of the same type and age to those found on Leanne's body was also found in the boot. This was later found to be incorrect, the maggot was actually of a different age.
* Blood consistent with Leanne's was found in several places around the house.
* Car tracks of the same type as Stafford's car were found on the track leading to Leanne's body.
* Stafford lied during police interviews.
* A fold-up chair usually kept in the boot of Stafford's car was found inside the house.

==New evidence presented at appeal==
The following evidence was available and called to the court's attention in the 1997 appeal. 
* Evidence demonstrating that Graham Stafford could not have committed the murder at the time when the Crown contended he had had the opportunity to do so was available to police at the time. This included transcripts of interviews with four separate witnesses and a shopping docket and car wash receipt showing incompatible times.
* Experts disputed that the blood evidence was consistent with the Crown's case due to the lack of a substantial amount of blood and the lack of a foul smell from the boot.
* The hair found on a sponge in Stafford's car boot was not found by the officer taking evidence. It was found during a laboratory examination after the sponge had been on the floor.
* The time of death based on the maggot's development was changed to Tuesday morning from the original Wednesday evening estimate due to an incorrect ambient temperature reading. Stafford was at work on the Tuesday.
* The trial judge referred to &quot;large quantities of blood&quot; around the house. This is inconsistent with the very small amount of blood found in the bathroom, which was consistent with ordinary household use.
* Several relevant pieces of information relating to the tyre tracks and the missing hammer were either not presented or were misrepresented during the trial. The type of tyre tracks found at the murder scene was also quite common.

==Further developments==
A Brisbane [[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|Sunday Mail]] examination of the police investigation revealed that an Ipswich computer store worker provided information to the police about a man who had entered the store on the same day as Leanne's body was dumped in nearby bushland. The worker claimed that the man had been behaving in a peculiar manner and had blood stains on his hands and trousers when he entered the store. Furthermore, reports of Leanne having been seen alive on the day after the police allege she was murdered were ignored. A report of a vehicle other than Stafford's being sighted near the body was also ignored. 

Forensic scientist, Angela van Daal, gave evidence at trial that helped convict Stafford of the murder. She has since stated that the blood identified as Leanne's could have come from another family member. Although the frequency of the blood type matching anyone in the general population was only about one percent, the frequency among relatives is as high as 25 percent. Around the time of the murder, Leanne's brother Craig had slashed his hand in a pub fight and had bled freely in the family home, also Leanne had recently cut her foot and had walked through the house.

It has also been revealed that another twelve-year-old girl was murdered less than one kilometre away from where Leanne Holland lived within thirteen days of Leanne's murder. The man who was charged with the second murder had been known to Leanne. Furthermore, daughters of a police informant in the Leanne Holland case have come forward claiming their father sexually abused them at the murder site, burnt them with cigarette lighters and showed them crime scene photographs of Leanne's body.

Channel 7 aired the program &quot;Murder Uncovered&quot; on Leanne's murder. Stafford was interviewed extensively by Michael Usher, who put to him the findings of the police reinvestigation into Leanne's death. Author and Stafford supporter Graham Crowley who wrote a book on Stafford's innocence and was one of his greatest defenders, was also given the results of the police reinvestigation into the case. After reading the report Crowley now believes the evidence overwhelmingly points to Stafford's guilt. This evidence includes chemical testing on Leanne's hair which showed she had dyed her hair partially blonde before being attacked, new DNA blood evidence in the bathroom including on the shower curtain, which shows Leanne's blood was spattered on the shower curtain and walls, blood evidence in the boot of Stafford's car, and an imprint on Leanne's thighs and buttocks which matched that of a car mat that was unique to Stafford's model of car. 
Stafford was asked to take a polygraph by Channel 7 for the programme but refused. He later took a self funded polygraph. The results were that he was being deceptive.

'''Graham Frederick Young''' (7 September 1947 – 1 August 1990) was an English [[serial killer]] who used [[poison]] to kill his victims. He was sent to [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in 1962 after poisoning several members of his family, killing his stepmother. After his release in 1971 he went on to poison 70 more people, two of whom died. Young, who was known as the '''Teacup Poisoner''', was then sent to [[Parkhurst Prison]] where he died of a heart attack in 1990.

==Early life and crimes==
Young was born in [[Neasden]], north west [[London]]. His mother died a few months after his birth. He was sent by his father to live with an uncle and aunt, while his older sister went to live with grandparents. A few years later he was separated from his aunt and uncle in order to live with his father and new stepmother.

He was fascinated from an early age by poisons and their effects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide: 100 Extraordinary, Bizarre and Gruesome Murders'' ISBN 1-85487-083-1 p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 Young passed his [[eleven-plus]], and went to [[Grammar School]].

In 1961, he started to test poisons (including [[antimony]]) on his family, enough to make them violently ill. Since February, 37-year-old Molly Young had suffered vomiting, diarrhea and excruciating stomach pain, which she initially dismissed as bilious attacks. Before long her husband Fred, 44, was also suffering, with similar stomach cramps debilitating him for days at a time. Then Young's sister was violently ill on a couple of occasions that summer. Shortly afterwards, Young himself was violently sick at home.

It even seemed as if the mystery bug had spread beyond their household – a couple of Young's school friends had also been off school ill a couple of times with similar painful symptoms.

In November 1961, Winifred Young was served a cup of tea by her brother one morning, but found its taste so sour she took only one mouthful before she threw it away. While on the train to work an hour later, she began to hallucinate, had to be helped out of the station and was eventually taken to hospital, where doctors came to the conclusion that she had somehow been infected with the rare poison [[Atropa belladonna]]. Fred Young confronted his son, but Graham blamed Winifred, who he claimed had been using the family's teacups to mix shampoo.

Unconvinced, Fred searched Graham's room, but found nothing incriminating. Nevertheless, he warned his son to be more careful in future when &quot;messing about with those bloody chemicals.&quot;

On Easter Saturday, 21 April 1962, Young's stepmother, Molly, died from poisoning. Young's aunt, who knew of his fascination with [[chemistry]] and poisons, became suspicious. Young was sent to a psychiatrist, who recommended contacting the police. Young was arrested on 23 May 1962 and confessed to the attempted murders of his father, sister, and friend. The remains of his stepmother could not be analysed because she had been [[cremated]], and at the time her death was not treated as suspicious but rather as the result of complications from injuries sustained in a traffic accident.

Young was detained under the Mental Health Act in [[Broadmoor Hospital]], an institution for patients with [[mental disorders]] who have committed offences, after having been assessed by two psychiatrists prior to his trial and diagnosed as suffering from a [[personality disorder]], and also [[schizophrenia]] (classed under the law then as [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] disorder as it was linked to abnormal violence). He was Broadmoor's youngest inmate since 1885.

Subsequent analysis has also suggested signs of the [[Autism spectrum]] (cf Bowden 1996).

His detention was subject to special restriction meaning that subsequent discharge, leave of absence etc. would have to be approved by the Home Secretary.  The Hospital Order initially stipulated that he should be detained for at least 15 years. The Secretary of State later noted that the index offences, for someone found sane, carried a sentence of no more than seven or eight years. Young was released after nine years, deemed &quot;fully recovered&quot;. In the hospital, Young had studied medical texts, improving his knowledge of poisons, and continued experiments using inmates and staff (one of whom died). It was rumoured that his knowledge of poisons was such that he could even extract cyanide from laurel bush leaves on the mental hospital grounds and that he used this cyanide to murder fellow inmate John Berridge.&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, John, ''The Elements of Murder: A History of Poison'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1970, after nearly eight years in Broadmoor, Dr. Edgar Udwin, the prison psychiatrist, wrote to the home secretary to recommend his release, announcing that Young &quot;is no longer obsessed with poisons, violence and mischief.&quot;

==Later crimes==
After release from hospital in February 1971, he began work as a quartermaster at John Hadland Laboratories in [[Bovingdon]], [[Hertfordshire]], near his sister's home in [[Hemel Hempstead]]. The company manufactured [[Thallium halides|thallium bromide-iodide]] infrared lenses, which were used in military equipment. However, no [[thallium]] was stored on site, and Young obtained his supplies of the poison from a London chemist. His employers received references as part of Young's [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] from [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]], but were not informed of his past as a convicted poisoner. Young's [[probation officer]] never visited Young's home or place of work (official Aavold Report into the Young case, 1973).

Soon after he began work, his foreman, Bob Egle, grew ill and died. Young had been making tea laced with poisons for his colleagues. A sickness swept through his workplace and, mistaken for a virus, was nicknamed the Bovingdon Bug. These cases of nausea and illness, sometimes severe enough to require hospitalisation, were later attributed to Young and his tea.

Young poisoned about 70 people during the next few months, none fatally. Egle's successor sickened soon after starting work there, but decided to quit. A few months after Egle's death, another of Young's workmates, Fred Biggs, grew ill and was admitted to London National Hospital for Nervous Diseases (now part of the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]]). It was too late and after suffering agony for several weeks, he became Young's third and final victim.

At this point, it was evident that an investigation was necessary. Young asked the company doctor if the investigators had considered [[thallium]] poisoning. He also told a colleague that his hobby was the study of toxic chemicals. Young's colleague went to the police, who uncovered Young's criminal record.

Young was arrested in [[Sheerness]], [[Kent]], on 21 November 1971. Police found thallium in his pocket and antimony, thallium and [[aconitine]] in his home. They also discovered a detailed diary that Young had kept, noting the doses he had administered, their effects, and whether he was going to allow each person to live or die.

At his trial at [[St Albans]] Crown Court, which started on 19 June 1972 and lasted for ten days, Young pleaded not guilty, and claimed the diary was a [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] for a novel. Young was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He was dubbed &quot;The Teacup Poisoner&quot;.

While in prison, he befriended fellow serial killer [[Moors murders|Moors murderer]] [[Ian Brady]], with whom he shared a fascination with [[Nazi Germany]]. In his book, ''The Gates of Janus'' (2001) published by [[Feral House]], Brady wrote that &quot;it was hard not to have empathy for Graham Young&quot;. The reformed criminal [[Roy Shaw]] in ''Pretty Boy'' (2003), his autobiography, recounts his friendship with Young.

Young died in his cell at [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|Parkhurst]] prison on the evening of 1 August 1990, one month before his 43rd birthday. The cause of death was listed as [[myocardial infarction]] at an inquest, after a postmortem.

==In popular culture==
A film called ''[[The Young Poisoner's Handbook]]'' (1995) is loosely based on Young's life.

In November 2005, a 16-year-old Japanese schoolgirl was arrested for poisoning her mother with [[thallium]]. She claimed to be fascinated by Young, having seen the 1995 film, and kept an online blog, similar to Young’s diary, recording dosage and reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article585815.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Schoolgirl blogger poisons mother in homage to killer | first=Leo | last=Lewis | date=3 November 2005 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4961768.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ruling on Japan poison-diary girl | date=1 May 2006 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notorious case of Graham Young, which led to the Butler Report 1975, led to the expansion in forensic mental health services with the development of regional (now referred to as medium) secure units in most of the health regions in England, and in Wales. Prior to that there had been only the high security hospitals known as Broadmoor, Rampton, and Ashworth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmhealth/373/0051802.htm|title=Memorandum by Dr Peter Snowden, Acting Medical Director, Mental Health Services of Salford NHS Trust  |publisher=parliament.uk |date=2000-06-20 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand High Witch of All The World''' or just the '''Grand High Witch''' is a title given to the leader of all [[witches]] on [[Earth|Planet Earth]], according to [[Roald Dahl]]'s 1983 book ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]''. The Grand High Witch is also the main [[antagonist]] of the book and the [[The Witches (1990 film)|film]].  Described as being &quot;without mercy,&quot; she travels around the world summoning all the witches of whatever country she is in, giving congratulations or punishments according to the witches' success in their ultimate mission: destroying children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.readkiddoread.com/book/234 |publisher=James Patterson's Read Kiddo Read |title=The Witches|ISBN=978-0-14-241011-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She teaches them such schemes as trapping children inside paintings, turning them into [[slugs]] so they can be &quot;squished&quot; or (it is rumoured) turning American children into [[hot dogs]] so that they will be eaten by their own parents.  She is said to own a counterfeit machine that leaves her no problem in traveling wherever she likes, or helping her lesser witches financially if she feels they need some assistance in their quest to eliminate all things juvenile.

==Role in the story==
The Grand High Witch within this story is noted for being particularly intolerant and demanding.  At a yearly meeting of her English minions in a hotel, she demands that all of England's children be exterminated by the next annual meeting.  When one brave or foolish witch claims this is impossible, the Grand High Witch tauntingly versifies her minion's impertinence and uselessness and burns her to oblivion by directing lasers from her eyes; a punishment all witches fear, and one known in their community as &quot;getting fried&quot;, which happens to one witch every time a meeting happens. Indeed, it is mentioned that the Grand High Witch makes it a personal rule to fry at least one witch at every meeting in order to keep the rest on their metaphorical toes.

The Grand High Witch then explains that the elimination of children will be easily accomplished if all the witches set up in trade as [[sweetshop]] owners.  All of the sweets they sell will have been treated with a [[potion]] she has created, &quot;Formula 86: Delayed Action Mouse Maker&quot;, that will turn anyone who consumes it into a [[mouse]]. This, she says, will convince parents and schoolteachers to kill the children, mistaking them for genuine pests. The witches and the story's [[narrator]], himself a child, then witness a young boy, Bruno Jenkins, who has previously been fed some potion-inserted chocolate, enter the room, whereupon he is changed into a mouse to demonstrate the potion's effect. In the Dining Room, one witch drinks the soup first (after the narrator put the Formula in) and transforms into a mouse. She warns the other witches not to drink the soup, but the Grand High Witch mistakes her for an ordinary mouse, and &quot;kills&quot; the mouse.

The witches, satisfied that they will meet their leader's demands to destroy all children in England, are about to leave when one of the witches then picks up the scent of the story's narrator.  They corner him in the meeting hall and force-feed him the potion, and attempt, when he becomes a mouse, to crush him; but he escapes and finds Bruno again.  The two mice then find their way back to the room occupied by the narrator's grandmother. Later, the narrator steals the potion, infiltrates the hotel's kitchen, and slips the potion in the witches' [[soup]]. All the witches, including the Grand High Witch, are transformed into mice and instantly are chopped to pieces by the cooks. The narrator and his grandmother, realizing that, as with [[queen bee#Supersedure|queen bees]], when the leader dies there is always going to be another individual who will take over the role of leadership, thereafter plan to move into the Grand High Witch's castle and use it as a base to track down the other witches, so as to spike their food as well, turn them into mice and destroy them with [[cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roalddahlfans.com/books/witcrev1.php |title=The Witches Review |year=1983 |publisher=NY Times |author=Erica Jong |location=Roald Dahl Fans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal characteristics==
The Grand High Witch is described as being &quot;without mercy&quot;, &quot;the most evil woman in creation&quot; and &quot;the most evil allg woman in the world&quot;: one who utterly detests children, disdaining the oblivion of one child per week for each of the eighty-five witches in England as &quot;no use&quot;, and indifferent as to whether or not adults are turned into mice and destroyed in the process. She is impatient, volatile, aggressive, and tyrannical, caring nothing as to how her demands are carried out provided they are obeyed and leave no trace of witches being involved. While furious at those who contradict or offer nothing constructive to her plans, she displays a favourable, if terse, attitude towards those witches- particularly &quot;the ancient ones&quot;- who have served her well over the years and eliminated many children, even supplying them with ready-made potion so that they may keep up with their younger counterparts. Her &quot;real&quot; name is never mentioned in the book. She resides in a castle in Norway, where she is known as a wealthy baroness, and operates her business mostly from there. She finances her devious plans with a machine that can make practically any currency in the world.  While she forbids lesser witches from contacting their fellows in other countries, she uses her enormous wealth to fund her schemes and journey from place to place to contact them herself.  In each country, she books into a hotel, summoning all the native witches and passes them off as a party of ordinary, good-natured women. For this year's meeting, the witches of England style themselves (ironically) as the [[NSPCC|RSPCC]], with the Grand High Witch posing as the chairwoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/ForChildren/The-Witches-13654.html |publisher=Fun Trivia |title=Interesting Questions, Facts, and Information: The Witches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all witches within the story's universe, the Grand High Witch has no toes or hair, and has clawed hands. Strangely, she does not remove her wig, gloves, or shoes at any point within the story, perhaps suggesting she has more to hide. She does, however, during her audience with the witches, remove a highly realistic [[mask]] from her face, revealing her features to look like &quot;something rotten&quot; and &quot;worm-eaten&quot;. She has a somewhat guttural accent (hence her pronunciation of England as &quot;Inkland&quot;) that gives her &quot;difficulty&quot; in pronouncing the letters &quot;R&quot; (&quot;rrr&quot;) and &quot;W&quot; (&quot;v&quot;). It is most likely she is Norwegian, as the book claims this to be the original homeland of all witches. Her ability to &quot;fry&quot; other witches is implied to be unique to her and to those who become her successors.

==The Film==
In the film version of the novel, the Grand High Witch (played by [[Anjelica Huston]]) is arguably more terrifying and fearsome than her counterpart in the novel. In the film, she poses as &quot;Eva Ernst,&quot; a tall, attractive woman of breeding with an aloof demeanor.  In the novel, her human persona is a petite woman with soft, demure features and a gentle voice.  It is implied that she is originally from [[Germany]]; she speaks with a marked German accent.  Also in the film, her true appearance is considerably more monstrous.  She has a bald, blistered scalp, a wizened face, long pointed nose, extended chin and elongated claws. She is also a [[hunchback]]. She has a very short temper and strikes terror into the hearts of her minions.  When the hero, Luke, sees her lay out her diabolical plan to kill all of England's children, she herself tracks him to his hotel room and drags him back to the meeting hall where he is turned into a mouse.

During the climax of the film, after Luke poured an entire bottle of her magic formula into the soup that the witches are having for their celebratory banquet, the witches begin to transform into mice, spreading chaos throughout the dining room, causing all the guests and the staff and the manager to kill them. The Grand High Witch initially appears to resist the potion's effects, but after Bruno jumps onto her chest, she appears to lose concentration long enough for the transformation to start. She is shown turning into a hideously deformed, snarling mouse and is insulted and condemned by Luke and his grandmother, Helga, as her evil is coming to an end. She is briefly trapped under an empty water-jug, and then, as in the novel, the Grand High Witch is finally destroyed when the hotel manager slices her in two with a meat cleaver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1029830-witches/ |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |title=The Witches (1990) |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, it is strongly hinted that the Grand High Witch knew Helga in the film - years ago (although in the beginning of the film, Helga claims that in her youth she searched the globe for the Grand High Witch, but never found her). The grandmother is missing a pinky-finger from one of her hands and becomes very tense when this injury is mentioned. No explanation is given, but when the Grand High Witch encounters Helga, she refers to her as &quot;an old adversary&quot;.  In the final confrontation, as the Grand High Witch vows that &quot;next time&quot; things will be different, Helga replies, &quot;No, no next time.  This time, it's your turn!&quot;

The Grand High Witch employs a [[secretary]] in the film, a witch named Miss Irvine. Yet Miss Irvine reveals, after having had enough of the Grand High Witch's appalling mistreatment of her, she &quot;didn't want to be one of them anyway&quot;. Because of this attitude, Miss Irvine does not fear the Grand High Witch as much as the other witches do, if she fears her at all. She is openly sardonic and rebellious to her employer's face.  It is subtly hinted that at bottom, she is good and tries to help the children who become victims of the witches, as she restores Luke and his friend Bruno to their human form at the end of the film.

After restoring Luke to his human form, Miss Irvine gleefully shows him her hands, which have changed from clawed to human as a result of her renouncing evil for good.

== Character Creation==
As part of the publicity for the Matilda Musical, Lucy Dahl, the daughter of Roald Dahl, was interviewed via Google Hangout about her father's books. She discussed The Witches at length, citing the Grand High Witch was inspired by her stepmother. Her stepmother's personality was not the factor, but it was her social status and look. Lucy also seriously stated she was not entirely sure witches were fiction, saying, &quot;There's this older lady, a neighbor. If witches are real, she's one of them  &quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je0EFeqrduA|publisher=Youtube Interview|title=Matilda Book Club June Hangout: The Witches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilhuff Tarkin''', also known as '''Grand Moff Tarkin''' or '''Governor Tarkin''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' franchise]], first portrayed by [[Peter Cushing]] in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. He is the commander of the [[Death Star]], the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s moon-sized super weapon. The character has been called &quot;one of the most formidable villains in ''Star Wars'' history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Todd|last=Gilchrist|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/724/724655p1.html|title=Star Wars Speeches: Grand Moff Tarkin|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and creation==
Tarkin's character was originally conceived as a holy man from the planet Aquila, but was changed later in the creative process into an antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/grandmofftarkin/ |accessdate=September 6, 2010 |publisher=[[Lucasfilm]] |title=Tarkin, Grand Moff |work=Databank |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803054643/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/grandmofftarkin/ |archivedate=August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] would not appear until later in the original trilogy, Lucas used Tarkin's final version as the &quot;main villain&quot; of the first film, a personification of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Lucas |first=George |year=2011 |title=Star Wars: The Complete Saga |medium=Blu-ray |location=Audio commentary for ''Episode IV – A New Hope''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayals===
During the production of ''Star Wars'', Peter Cushing found Tarkin's boots, furnished by the wardrobe department, to be very uncomfortable. Director [[George Lucas]] agreed to limit shots where Cushing's feet would be visible, allowing him to wear slippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Giza Death Star Deployed|author=Joseph Farrell|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|pages=1|year=2003|isbn=978-1-931882-19-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Smirk, Sneer and Scream|author=Mark Clark|pages=119|chapter=Peter Cushing|publisher=McFarland|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7864-1932-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science Fiction|author=Adam Charles Roberts|pages=88|chapter=The History of Science Fiction|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-19205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duke&gt;{{cite book|title=Harrison Ford: The Films|author=Brad Duke|pages=39|publisher=McFarland|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7864-2016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cushing admitted many years later to not knowing what a &quot;Grand Moff&quot; actually was, joking that it sounded like &quot;something which infests a clothes closet&quot; and decided to play him as a &quot;deeply cross and unpleasant gentleman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdXLDvx_tHQ &quot;Peter Cushing on playing Grand Moff Tarkin&quot;].

He threatens [[Princess Leia|Princess Leia Organa]] with the destruction of her home planet, [[Alderaan]], if Leia does not reveal the location of the Rebel main base of operations. When Leia names the planet Dantooine as the base's location, he destroys Alderaan anyway, hoping to make an example out of the planet's support of the Rebellion. Upon learning that Leia's coerced information was false, Tarkin orders Leia's execution.

He allows the Rebels to escape the Death Star with the Princess after placing a tracking beacon on the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' in order to find the Rebel base. He orders the Death Star to destroy the rebel base on Yavin IV. In [[Battle of Yavin|the film's climax]], Tarkin refuses to believe that the Death Star is in danger from the Rebel starfighter attack. As such, he refuses to evacuate and is finally killed when the Death Star is destroyed by [[Luke Skywalker]].

==== ''Rogue One'' ====
In the first anthology film ''[[Rogue One]]'', [[Orson Krennic]], Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military, meets with Tarkin, who expresses his skepticism about Krennic's management of the Death Star project.

Tarkin oversees the Death Star's first attack on the Rebellion when it is used to destroy a holy city on the planet Jedha. Impressed, he congratulates Krennic before announcing that he is going to take command of the Death Star from that point on, pointing out security breaches under Krennic's nose, much to Krennic's chagrin.

Later in the film, Tarkin is informed of a Rebel attack on Scarif, the planet where the plans to the Death Star are kept, he orders the jump to hyperspace to the planet, where an ongoing battle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance rages on. Tarkin has the Death Star target and destroy the Scarif base, killing Krennic, Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, and any other survivors of the ground battle, while [[Darth Vader]] handles the Rebel fleet.

In the television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', the young version of Tarkin appears in the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] Navy as a Captain and later an Admiral during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Christian|last=Blauvelt|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/02/17/star-wars-clone-wars-grand-moff-tarkin-exclusive-video/|title=Star Wars - The Clone Wars: Grand Moff Tarkin makes his debut!|publisher=[[EW.com]]|date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third season, Captain Tarkin and Jedi Master Even Piell are ambushed and attacked by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] forces. Prisoners to the Citadel, Tarkin and Piell are freed from captivity by a rescue team. Initially pessimistic about being in enemy territory, Tarkin puts himself at odds with Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, but their respective opinions of each other improve when each realizes that they are mutual acquaintances of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. During a skirmish, Tarkin fights and attempts to execute Osi Sobeck, but fails when the Citadel's caretaker swiftly retaliates and nearly kills him. However, Tarkin is rescued just in time by Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]].

In the fifth season, Admiral Tarkin suspects Ahsoka of murdering [[Letta Turmond]] during a [[terrorist]] attack, and attempts to have the Padawan arrested. After Ahsoka is recaptured and tried before a jury of senators, Tarkin heads the prosecution while [[Padmé Amidala]] heads the defense. Despite Padmé's impressive defense, Tarkin casts doubt by mentioning that Ahsoka had been seen with [[Dark Jedi]] [[Asajj Ventress]]. After Tarkin and Padmé's arguments conclude and the jury reaches a verdict that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is about to read, Skywalker arrives with [[Barriss Offee]], the real mastermind of the attack.

Tarkin has the Inquisitor execute Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint for the two's inability to deal with the cell's leader, Jedi Kanan Jarrus. Later, Tarkin sets a trap for the Rebels and manages to capture Kanan during their mission to send a message through one of the planet's communication towers. The Rebels' message gets sent out, but Tarkin then orders the tower to be destroyed. Kanan is tortured by the Inquisitor and transported to the [[Mustafar]] system aboard Tarkin's [[Star Destroyer]]. During Kanan's rescue by Rebel forces, Tarkin's Star Destroyer is destroyed, and the Inquisitor is killed. On Lothal, Tarkin introduces Agent Kallus to Darth Vader.

Taking the loss of his personal Star Destroyer personally, Tarkin orders that Maketh Tua be brought before him for her failure to find the Lothal rebels. Knowing the true meaning behind the summoning after the deaths of Aresko and Grint, Tua attempts to defect, but she is killed before she can leave Lothal. Tarkin later appears in the season three premiere where he meets with Governor Pryce regarding the Lothal Rebels.

'''Grandfather Paradox''', usually referred to as '''the Grandfather''', is a fictional character in the British science fiction franchise ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its spin-off franchise ''[[Faction Paradox]]''. In the BBC's ''[[Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' novels, the Grandfather is a corrupt future version of the [[Eighth Doctor]], while in [[Lawrence Miles]]'s ''Faction Paradox'' series he is a seemingly incorporeal Time Lord of unknown identity. Both narratives portray him as the founder of Faction Paradox, a time-travelling voodoo cult.

==Fictional character biography==
===''Doctor Who''===
In Lawrence Miles's ''[[Christmas on a Rational Planet]]'', the Grandfather is referred to as the &quot;voodoo priest of the House of Lungbarrow&quot;, suggesting he may have originated in [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]'s own family.

In [[Lance Parkin]]'s ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005 novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'', the Doctor recalls his childhood, when his mother read him an ancient Gallifreyan legend about an adventurous youth. Ignoring his elders' warnings, the youth travelled into his own past and – with no clear motivation – murdered his own grandfather with an ordinary knife. The murder prevented the youth's birth, which prevented the murder, creating an irresolvable paradox. The youth was never heard from again, but legends said that he existed on some level as a being named Grandfather Paradox, a &quot;shadowy half-man, simultaneously alive and dead, murderer and victim&quot;, always plotting against the Time Lords.

The Grandfather is the founder and leader of Faction Paradox, a time-travelling voodoo cult. Rejecting the ethos of Time Lord society, Faction Paradox members enjoy interfering with time travel and causing havoc and paradoxes. Their ritualistic practises and use of death imagery is a repudiation of the Time Lords' immortality. Rather than reproduce, Faction Paradox prefer to recruit outcasts, both from the Time Lords and lesser races such as humans.

At some point, Grandfather Paradox is captured by the Time Lords. They imprison him in Shada, their prison asteroid, declining to execute him because they fear him dead more than alive. In ''Christmas on a Rational Planet'', the Carnival Queen disrupts the universe's rationality; this causes [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Lady President Romana]] to suffer an epileptic fit in which she signs an order to release 300 prisoners. Grandfather Paradox leads the mass escape from Shada.

In ''Alien Bodies'', the Grandfather sends two Faction Paradox representatives – Cousin Justine and Little Brother Manjuele – to an auction to bid for the body of the Doctor, who has been killed in a future War between the Time Lords, Faction Paradox and an unknown Enemy. The Grandfather plans to obtain the future Doctor's biodata and grow from its strength, but this is prevented by the Eighth Doctor, who destroys the body to prevent it from being used as a weapon. In the same book, the Doctor speculates that, like the [[Celestial Intervention Agency]], the Grandfather has erased himself from history to become a being of pure concept.

The character makes his only direct appearance in ''[[The Ancestor Cell]]'', where he is revealed to be a future Eighth Doctor, corrupted by Faction Paradox's biodata virus. The Grandfather takes command of Faction Paradox, planning to lead them to victory in the War and conquer both the Time Lords and the Enemy. The Doctor destabilises the TARDIS, which has been drawing energy from a bottle universe to contain the corrupt timeline where the virus infected him. The energy released erases Faction Paradox and the Grandfather from existence, at the cost of destroying Gallifrey. This sequence is revisited in a flashback in ''The Gallifrey Chronicles'', which states that the Grandfather is the Doctor from 292 years into the future. The novel also states that the Grandfather is not just the Doctor's future self, but everyone's:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This was what you became if you didn't mend your ways. Anyone looking him in the eye would see themselves staring back. Consumed not with anything as lurid as evil, but with cynicism masquerading as cleverness. Self-absorption and pettiness, pragmatism and grudges, boredom and sadness. He is the person you vow you'll never become as an adventurous youth, and he’s always watching you, ready to strike.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Faction Paradox''===
In ''The Faction Paradox Protocols'' audio series, it is revealed that Faction Paradox still possess the knife with which the Grandfather cut off his arm. The knife is stained with the Grandfather's dried blood – all that remains of him in the physical universe – and has become imbued with his &quot;shadow&quot;. Faction Paradox members traditionally bond their chosen weapons to their shadows, allowing them to draw at any time and strike enemies without physically moving. After losing her shadow in an accident, Cousin Justine takes the Grandfather's knife and is bonded to his one-armed shadow, allowing her to access his seemingly infinite weapons instantly. Justine is later convicted by the Great Houses, as Faction Paradox custom dictates that she is now legally the Grandfather and therefore responsible for his crimes. She eventually escapes their prison asteroid, but begins to wonder if the Grandfather's shadow is driving her mad.

The Grandfather is revered in the Eleven-Day Empire, a version of London created when Faction Paradox purchased eleven days from the British government at the enactment of the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]]. A statue of the Grandfather stands atop their version of [[Nelson's Column]], and the speaker's chair in their version of the [[Palace of Westminster]] is always left empty, awaiting the Grandfather's return.

==Appearance==
The legends agree that Grandfather Paradox has only one arm, but which arm he lost and how he lost it are disputed. In ''The Ancestor Cell'', the Grandfather claims that he cut it off to remove the criminal branding applied by the Time Lords after he committed atrocities against reality which he can no longer remember. At the novel's climax, the Eighth Doctor tells the Grandfather that he removed it because it was the arm with which he had destroyed Gallifrey.

In ''The Ancestor Cell'', the Grandfather appears as an older, emaciated, sallow-skinned Eighth Doctor, with a shaved head, &quot;hooded, glittering glacier-eyes&quot;, and an old [[Hessian (cloth)|hessian]] cloak. In a flashback to the same events, ''The Gallifrey Chronicles'' offers a slightly different description of the Grandfather: his hair and skin are greying, and he wears a heavy leather cloak over the Eighth Doctor's original frock coat, which is now faded and cobwebbed. His movements are subtly different from the Doctor's, the loss of an arm having changed his centre of balance. The novel also suggests that the Grandfather's appearance varies, and that anyone who looks him in the eye will see themselves staring back.

==Conceptual history==
The character was first mentioned in Lawrence Miles's 1995 novel ''Christmas on a Rational Planet'', which briefly describes his escape from Shada. Miles named the character in reference to the [[grandfather paradox]], a thought experiment in which a time traveller kills their own grandfather, preventing their own birth, which prevents the murder, and so on in a paradoxical loop.

The Grandfather influences events in several of Miles's later novels, but he never appears directly and is never identified. This changes in ''The Ancestor Cell'', written by Peter Angelides and [[Stephen Cole (writer)|Stephen Cole]] under incoming editor [[Justin Richards]]. In his review of the novel, Miles decried the revelation that the Grandfather is a future Doctor as &quot;crass and predictable&quot;, labelling this version of the character as &quot;just the [[Valeyard]] with a new haircut&quot;. Miles cited the lack of logic in having a more experienced Doctor outwitted by his younger self, declaring the resolution &quot;obviously not true&quot;. All subsequent ''Faction Paradox'' stories written or edited by Miles ignore the revelations of ''The Ancestor Cell'', leaving the Grandfather's identity a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planeteleven.co.uk/features/lmia/ancestorcell.php |title=My Review of THE ANCESTOR CELL |last=Miles |first=Lawrence |authorlink=Lawrence Miles |publisher=''Planet Eleven'' |accessdate=23 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050127140324/http://www.planeteleven.co.uk/features/lmia/ancestorcell.php |archivedate=January 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 interview, Miles stated that he never meant the Grandfather to appear in person, comparing him to [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#.22Doctor who.3F.22|the Doctor's name]] or [[Judge Dredd]]'s face as something that loses all value when revealed. He concluded, &quot;If I had to have him appear in person, I'd probably make him [[Ronnie Barker]] in ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]''. The [[Norman Stanley Fletcher]] of Shada. With one arm.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planeteleven.co.uk/features/lmia/64thousand.php |title=64 Thousand Questions |publisher=''Planet Eleven'' |date=11 March 2001 |accessdate=23 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301093713/http://www.planeteleven.co.uk/features/lmia/64thousand.php |archivedate=March 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition of their ''Doctor Who'' reference book ''AHistory'', Lance Parkin and [[Lars Pearson]] attempt to reconcile the War depicted in the ''Eighth Doctor Adventures'' novels with the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Last Great Time War]] depicted in the revived series of ''Doctor Who''. They suggest that Grandfather Paradox is the Doctor who fought in the Last Great Time War, and that his experiences left him scarred and callous, without faith in humanity. After failing to prevent the younger Eighth Doctor from destroying Gallifrey in ''The Ancestor Cell'', Grandfather Paradox regenerates into [[Christopher Eccleston]]'s [[Ninth Doctor]], regrowing his arm in the process. Parkin notes that this would explain the Ninth Doctor's conflicted recollection of Gallifrey's destruction in the episode &quot;[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]&quot;: &quot;I watched it happen… I made it happen… I tried to stop it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AHistory: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe|last1=Parkin|first1=Lance|last2=Pearson|first2=Lars|authorlink1=Lance Parkin|authorlink2=Lars Pearson|edition=2nd|date=5 December 2007|publisher=Mad Norwegian Press|location=Des Moines, Iowa|isbn=978-0975944660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17763">[[Image:Gravemindcapture.jpg|thumb|300px|The Gravemind holds [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] and the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] captive in ''Halo 2''.]]

The '''Gravemind''' is a parasitic, [[group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] intelligence in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' universe. While only one Gravemind is ever seen in the games, the title is given to the final stage of [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] evolution, in which the Flood becomes a [[superorganism]].  The Flood is a highly-infectious [[Parasitism|parasite]] which is released several times during ''Halo''{{'}}s story. The [[Master Chief (Halo)|Chief]] and the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] (Thel'Vadam, during the course of [[Halo 2]] and [[Halo 3]]) are captured during their separate missions on Delta Halo, or [[Installation 05]], by a Gravemind, which resides in the bowels of the ancient [[Forerunners (Halo)|Forerunner]] [[Installation 05|ringworld]], where the Flood creature forges an alliance between the two foes in order to stop the activation of the ringworld — an event which would destroy all [[Sentience|sentient life]], and, therefore, starve the Flood. The character is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].

Making its first appearance in ''Halo 2'', the Gravemind was introduced to dispel the idea that the Flood is a mindless virus. The character was designed by a [[Bungie]] team, including artists Robert McLees and Juan Ramirez, and slowly developed into a massive creature with tentacles and a frightening level of intelligence. Driven by a desire to spread, the Gravemind is cunning and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]; he forges alliances as often as he tries to consume his allies, tricking the Master Chief into aiding him while infecting the Chief's compatriots at the same time. The character has had a mixed reception by many critics upon his appearance in ''Halo 2'', and reviewers including [[1UP.com]] found his role in ''Halo 3'' confusing and without clear motive. More positively, critic [[Aaron Sagers]] used Gravemind as an example of a &quot;[[frenemy]]&quot; — the creature's appearance made the Master Chief's fight against the Flood more personal and more dramatic.

==Design and attributes==
[[Image:Gravemind mclees.jpg|thumb|One of Robert McLees' early designs for the Gravemind]]

Early Concepts for the Gravemind were done by Bungie artist Robert McLees. McLees is known at Bungie as the &quot;architect of the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Luke|url= http://halo.bungie.net/news/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;cid=12753|title= Halo Universe: Covenant Weapons|accessdate=2007-11-09 |publisher= [[Bungie.net]]|date=2007-09-06|authorlink= Luke Smith (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had done the early concepts for the Flood forms in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. McLees' original drawings were then added to by Juan Ramirez.&lt;ref name=aoh71&gt;{{cite book|last=Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year=2004|publisher=Del Ray Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-345-47586-0|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gravemind's form and design constantly changed during development. Early versions of the creature had a basic shape of a mass of tentacles, with a jagged tear in one large appendage forming a rudimentary mouth. Later on, the mouth was studded with the skulls of human and Covenant corpses for teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Joseph Staten|Staten, Joseph]] |date=2007-09-25 |title=Halo 2 Developer's Commentary |medium=[[Halo 3 Legendary Edition|''Halo 3'' Legendary Edition]] | time=54:00| publisher=[[Bungie]]}}—'''Staten:''' &quot;...as originally designed, the Gravemind was this seething mass of corpses right, his teeth were skulls and he talked from the shadows. When we moved to the world where we wanted him to have lip sync and actually speak... maybe not the best decision in the world.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This design was later revised due to practical considerations about lip syncing the character for speech. Despite these design changes, the Gravemind's size was always meant to be huge;&lt;ref name=aoh72&gt;{{cite book|last=Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year=2004|publisher=Del Ray Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-345-47586-0|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; early concepts showed the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] dwarfed by the Flood intelligence.

Unlike the mindless &quot;zombie&quot; nature of most Flood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Godinez, Victor|date=2006-07-16|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/ptech/gamereviews2/071806ccdrPTECHhalobook.1d4d3a2.html|title=Review: The Halo Graphic Novel|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|accessdate=2007-09-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930031323/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/ptech/gamereviews2/071806ccdrPTECHhalobook.1d4d3a2.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Gravemind is depicted as intelligent and cunning,&lt;ref name=primer&gt;{{cite web|author=West, Steve|date=2007-09-09|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/CB-Games-Halo-3-Primer-Characters-6265.html|title=CB Games Halo 3 Primer: Characters|publisher=Cinema Blend|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acts as a [[collective intelligence|collective mind]] driving the Flood. It lyrically speaks prose in a form of [[trochaic]] or [[iambic heptameter]].&lt;ref name=1upprimer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/halo-3-story-primer|title=The Halo Story: A Primer|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2008-01-30|date=2007-09-07|author=Parrish, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; While capable of subterfuge, Gravemind is seen to use the brute strength and sheer numbers of the Flood to further its aims. When attacking planets, the Gravemind of the Forerunner's time used smaller craft as [[ablative armor]], sacrificing countless Flood so that larger ships can land and infest major population centers.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'''MB''': 2 hours ago 12,423 small recreational vessels appeared inside [CE-10-2165-d's] orbital perimeter. Hidden within that vast swarm were seven massive freight carries. The smaller craft were employed as ablative armor, allowing the carriers to descend through the atmosphere; landing on top of major population centers. Despite the fact that the naval garrison was aware of the likelihood of just such an attack, their ability to effectively defend against it proved insufficient. This has always been the enemy's [modus operandi]: [flood] your opponent's ability to process information with so much noise that no meaningful resistance can be put into action.&quot;—{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 3]]| developer=Bungie |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007 |platform=Xbox 360 |level=(Terminal 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more strategic move, Gravemind uses logic to sway the Forerunner's own [[artificial intelligence]], Mendicant Bias, to his side. While Mendicant Bias had been specifically created to defeat the Gravemind, the Flood leader convinces the AI that the Flood is a utopian ideal, and that its conquest of the galaxy is inevitable. While the Gravemind's motivations and goals are not made expressly clear in ''Halo 2'', ''Halo 3'' reveals Gravemind's ultimate goal is to consume all thinking beings in the galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;h3 manual&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bungie|year=2007|title=Halo 3 Instruction Manual|publisher=Microsoft}}—[http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/halo3.aspx Online version] (requires [[Microsoft Silverlight]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gravemind's physical form is depicted as composed of rotting corpses and biomatter, towering nearly eighty meters high as seen in ''Halo 2''.&lt;ref name=scale&gt;{{cite web|author=Loftus, Stephen|url=http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/sloftus_scalecomparison/?display=Forerunner|title=Determining the Real Sizes of Objects in Halo|year=2005|publisher=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravemind resembles a large [[Venus Flytrap]] with many tentacles, but is capable of movement and linguistic communication via its large mouth formed from overlapping fleshy &quot;leaves&quot;. Though an animal, the Gravemind's somewhat plantlike appearance has drawn comparisons to Audrey II from the [[1986 film]] ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' due to the tentacles about a central mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Martin O'Donnell|O'Donnell, Marty]] |date=2007-09-25|title=Halo 2 Developer's Commentary |medium=[[Halo 3 Legendary Edition|''Halo 3'' Legendary Edition]] | time=53:00| publisher=[[Bungie]]}}—'''O'Donnell:''' &quot;It's not a plant, it's not Audrey, although I don't know why I keep thinking about Audrey.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Halo 2: Anniversary'', the Gravemind now has three flesh-flaps that protrude and dangle towards the front of its head, each one decorated with teeth. It is also given a different sort of mouth, one that resembles a lipless mouth with fangs.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Appearances==
The Gravemind makes his first appearance halfway through ''[[Halo 2]]''{{'}}s campaign. Using his tentacles to save the Master Chief and Arbiter from perishing, Gravemind brings them face to face in a chasm on [[Installation 05|Delta Halo]]. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the ring's architects, the [[Forerunners (Halo)|Forerunners]], died when they activated the installation in order to stop the threat of the Flood; the Master Chief verifies what the creature says, having stopped the firing of another ring in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''. Though the Arbiter does not accept the truth immediately, Gravemind sends the Master Chief to the Covenant city ''High Charity'' and the Arbiter to the Halo's control room in order to stop the deluded Covenant from killing all sentient life a second time. Though he promises an alliance, Gravemind has ulterior motives. His Flood infest the human ship ''In Amber Clad'' and makes a [[slipspace]] jump into ''High Charity'' itself, in an effort to use the station to escape the confines of Halo.&lt;ref name=&quot;its a trap!&quot;&gt;&quot;'''Cortana''': Flood-controlled dropships are touching down all over the city. That creature beneath the Library, that &quot;Gravemind&quot;, used us. We were just a diversion; In Amber Clad was always its intended vector.&quot;—{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie Studios|publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| platform =[[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]| version = | level = High Charity| isolang = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having taken over the city, Gravemind questions the A.I. [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]], who was left behind to destroy ''High Charity'' if Halo was activated. Gravemind says that he has questions that he will ask, and Cortana agrees to answer them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'''Gravemind''': Silence fills the empty grave, now that I have gone. But my mind is not at rest, for questions linger on. Now I will ask, and you will answer. / '''Cortana''': Alright, shoot.&quot;—{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 2]] |developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |date=2004 |platform=[[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] |version= |level=The Great Journey |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short story in the 2009 ''Halo: Evolutions'' anthology details the conversations that follow.

Gravemind is one of the primary antagonists of ''[[Halo 3]]''. While the Master Chief and Arbiter have returned to Earth in order to stop the [[Prophet of Truth]], the religious leader of the Covenant, from activating a Forerunner artifact buried in Africa, Gravemind turns ''High Charity'' into a Flood hive and sends an infected cruiser to Earth in an effort to infest the planet; this plan fails, and a message from Cortana informs the Master Chief and allies of the existence of the [[The Ark (Halo)|Ark]], a special installation built by the Forerunners outside of the [[Milky Way galaxy]] where ''all'' the Halos can be fired remotely. Gravemind, the Arbiter, and the Master Chief all want to stop the High Prophet of Truth from activating the rings, so the Flood once again ally with the Chief and Arbiter. As soon as  Truth is killed, however, the Gravemind betrays both the Master Chief and the Arbiter,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'''Gravemind''': Now the gate has been unlatched, headstones pushed aside, corpses shift and offer room, a fate you must abide! / '''Arbiter''': We trade one villain for another&quot;—{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 3]]| developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007 |platform=[[Xbox 360]] |version= |level=The Covenant |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief escapes the Flood's clutches and rescues Cortana from ''High Charity''. Despite being tortured by Gravemind, Cortana has managed to keep a secret safe from the Flood; she has the activation index of [[Installation 04]], which she captured from [[343 Guilty Spark]] during ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'''Cortana''': The activation index, from the first Halo ring. A little souvenir I hung onto, just in case.&quot;—{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 3]]| developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007 |platform=[[Xbox 360]] |version= |level=Cortana |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the index, Cortana can activate the local ringworld, destroying Gravemind but sparing the galaxy's sentient life. Gravemind finally gains this knowledge, but too late; the Master Chief escapes with Cortana, destroying ''High Charity'' in the process. Gravemind survives the blast and attempts to rebuild himself on the new ring. Despite his best efforts, the Master Chief and company activate Halo, defeating the Flood once again. Resigned to his defeat, Gravemind nonetheless insists that it will only slow—not stop—the Flood.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'''Gravemind''': Resignation is my virtue. Like water I ebb and flow. Defeat is simply the addition of time to a sentence I never deserved... but you imposed.&quot;—{{cite video game |title=[[Halo 3]]| developer=Bungie Studios |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007 |platform=[[Xbox 360]] |version= |level=Halo |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception of the leader of the Flood were mixed. In a review of ''Halo 2'', Mike Leonard of the AllXbox community said that the introduction of the Gravemind character had him &quot;rolling my eyes hard enough to get motion sickness from seeing the back of the inside of my skull&quot;;&lt;ref name=allxbox&gt;{{cite web|author=Leonard, Mike|url=http://www.allxbox.com/reviews/halo2.asp|title=A mega-look at the biggest Xbox game ever|publisher=AllXbox.com|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard went on to say that the &quot;''Little Shop of Horrors'' reject&quot; ruined the &quot;cool&quot; of the ''Halo'' franchise.&lt;ref name=allxbox/&gt; Staff from [[GamesRadar]] singled out the appearance of the Gravemind as a sign the ''Halo'' series had [[jumped the shark]]. &quot;Until Gravemind showed up, we were pretty sure we understood the ''Halo'' series' story,&quot; they wrote, but that the appearance of a [[Venus Flytrap]]-like creature with an ego and &quot;a tendency to spout philosophical drivel&quot; was unexpected.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamesradar-jump the shark&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2009-08-17|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/12-videogame-stories-that-jumped-the-shark/|title=12 Videogame Stories that Jumped the Shark|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=2010-02-23|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com]] bemoaned the fact that Gravemind was never explicitly stated to be the Flood leader in either ''Halo 2'' or ''Halo 3'' and was hardly seen in the third installment.&lt;ref name=&quot;1up-gravemind&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Parish, Jeremy |date=2007-12-31|title=6 of '07: Halo 3|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8551185&amp;publicUserId=5379721|accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications also took issue with the fact that the character's motivations were never fully explored; the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' said that the &quot;unique and compelling characters&quot; of ''Halo 3'', such as Cortana and the Master Chief, were overwhelmed by Gravemind.&lt;ref name=&quot;1up-gravemind&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jones, Scott|date=2007-09-25|title=Out With A Bang|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|page=E4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More favorably, [[Aaron Sagers]] of the newspaper ''[[The Morning Call]]'' saw Gravemind as a perfect example of a trend in pop culture called a &quot;[[frenemy]]&quot;. A frenemy, according to Sagers, is a friend or rival &quot;with whom [the protagonist] feuds; an individual who reinvigorates the sense of self-worth and drives up one's visibility in the public's eye.&quot; Gravemind, operating as a frenemy, served to personify the Master Chief's otherwise nebulous fight against the Flood.&lt;ref name=&quot;morningcall-frenemy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Sagers, Aaron|date=2007-10-03|title=Finding a frenemy to feel fine|work=The Morning Call|page=M2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Will Prusik of PlanetXbox360 listed the Flood as one of the great video game aliens, and that the revelation of a central Flood intelligence was a good idea despite the Gravemind's resemblance to Audrey II{{clarify|who or what is Audrey II?|date=August 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prusik, Will |date= |url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/?source=planetxbox360 |title=Top 10 Badass Video Game Aliens |publisher=Planet Xbox360 |accessdate=2010-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214020023/http://www.complex.com/video-games/?source=planetxbox360 |archivedate=December 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gray Fox''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Hideo Kojima]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series.

==Appearances==
The original ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'' game introduces {{Nihongo|Gray Fox|グレイ・フォックス|Gurei Fokkusu|spelled &quot;Grey Fox&quot; in the [[MSX2]] games}} as a high-ranking agent of [[FOXHOUND]] as the &quot;Fox&quot; codename being the highest commemoration within the unit. Prior to the game's events, he goes missing during a mission to [[Outer Heaven]] with his last transmission being a cryptic message simply saying &quot;[[Metal Gear (weapon)|Metal Gear]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gears 2008&quot;&gt;&quot;Snakes and Gears: A Metal Gear Overview&quot;, ''[[Game Informer]]'' 182 (June 2008): 108.&lt;/ref&gt; After being rescued by [[Solid Snake]], Fox reveals TX-55 Metal Gear's true nature to the player.

''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]'' revealed that Gray Fox left FOXHOUND and defected to Zanzibar Land. Fox pilots the advanced model Metal Gear D and confronts Solid Snake a few times, while secretly assisting Snake as an anonymous informant. Fox's past is fleshed out in this game; his civilian identity {{Nihongo|Frank Jaeger|フランク・イェーガー|Furanku Yēgā|&quot;Frank Yeager&quot; in the [[MSX2]] version}} is revealed to have a relationship with former Czech [[figure skater]] [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Gustava Heffner|Gustava Heffner]] (Natasha Marcova in the MSX2 version) after they met in [[Calgary]] and fell in love. Gustava tried to seek asylum with him in America, but failed and was stripped of her competition rights as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;mg2_manual&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Setting Manual|url=http://gtinter.msxnet.org/Setting.htm|work=[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]|publisher=[[Konami]]|accessdate=9 July 2012|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this incident, Frank developed a great deal of resentment toward his superiors, but was unaware that Gustava later joined the [[StB (Czechoslovak State Security)|StB]] and is present in Zanzibar as [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Kio Marv|Dr. Kio Marv]]'s bodyguard. During his and Snake's first direct encounter as enemies, Fox's piloting of the Metal Gear accidentally causes Gustava's death. After Snake destroys Metal Gear, Fox challenges Snake to a fistfight in the middle of a minefield and is apparently killed.

Gray Fox returns as the {{Nihongo|Cyborg Ninja|サイボーグ忍者|Saibōgu Ninja}} in ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' after he has been grafted into a [[powered armor]] [[exoskeleton]] and armed with a high-frequency blade. During [[Liquid Snake]]'s FOXHOUND revolt of Shadow Moses, Fox once again challenges Solid Snake to a fight, unintentionally maiming [[Revolver Ocelot]] and scaring [[Otacon]] in the process. After the fight, he becomes erratic and disappears in a violent rage. Throughout the game, he provides Snake cryptic advice via CODEC as a faceless contact calling himself &quot;Deepthroat&quot;. [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Naomi Hunter|Naomi Hunter]] eventually divulges being Fox's foster sister as well as his Cyborg Ninja identity to Snake. Later, during Snake's battle with [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear REX|Metal Gear REX]], Fox destroys REX's [[radome]] with the use of a prototype [[railgun]] attached to his arm. However, Fox is killed by Liquid (piloting REX). Before doing so, when Liquid is holding Fox in REX's jaws, the player is given the option to fire a stinger at REX's open cockpit, but Snake refuses to shoot.

[[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] initially thought that the Cyborg Ninja in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' seen during [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Solidus Snake|Solidus Snake]]'s Manhattan incident was Gray Fox before learning that the person in question is actually [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Olga Gurlukovich|Olga Gurlukovich]].

The second prequel ''[[Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops]]'' (set twenty five years before ''Metal Gear'') featured a teenage version of the character under the codename {{Nihongo|Null|ヌル|Nuru}}, a masked [[machete]]-wielding assassin. Null is subjected to a secret [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] project to be the &quot;Perfect Soldier&quot; and recruited into [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Gene|Gene]]'s corrupt FOX unit during the San Hieronymo takeover. During the game, Null fights with [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] (Naked Snake) twice. During the second fight, Big Boss realized that Null was this boy in [[Mozambique]] that used his innocence as a cover to kill dozens of government soldiers with only one knife while speaking a little German, thus how he was deemed &quot;Frank Jaeger&quot; (German for &quot;Frank Hunter&quot;). After defeating Null, Big Boss sent Null to somewhere outside of FOX for help.

''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'' reveals that Frank Jaeger's murder of [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Para-Medic|Para-Medic]] was part of [[EVA (Metal Gear)|Big Mama]]'s plan to free Big Boss from [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Zero|Zero]]'s control.

===Other appearances===
There is a Cyborg Ninja unique character card in ''[[Metal Gear Acid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Retro Gamer'' 11, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the ''Metal Gear'' games, the Cyborg Ninja is featured as a [[player character]] driver in ''[[Konami Krazy Racers]]'' and as an assist trophy in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.

A Cyborg Ninja figure was released by [[McFarlane Toys]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metalgearcollection.com/version3/figure-ninja.html |title=Cyborg Ninja Figure |publisher=Metal Gear Collection.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure was released by [[Konami]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otaku.be/products/17021 |title=Otaku.com Metal Gear Solid Konami Figure 13 Ninja Color |publisher=Otaku.be |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a block-style figure was also released in the [[Kubrick (toy)|Kubrick]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metalgearcollection.com/version3/kubrick-ninja.html |title=Cyborg Ninja Kubrick |publisher=Metal Gear Collection.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, another Cyborg Ninja figure, as designed by Kojima himself, was announced to come from [[Square Enix]]'s Play Arts Kai line of ''Metal Gear'' figures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destructoid.com/badass-cyborg-ninja-from-metal-gear-solid-in-toy-form-201018.phtml Badass: Cyborg Ninja from Metal Gear Solid in toy form], Destructoid, 05.12.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and was released for the 25th anniversary of the ''Metal Gear'' series.

The special editions of ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'' features Gray Fox's Cyborg Ninja exoskeleton as a [[downloadable content]] [[Skin (computing)|skin]] for Raiden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/10243/article/metal-gear-solid-revengeance-gets-two-premium-editions-in-japan/ Metal Gear Solid Revengeance Gets Two Premium Editions in Japan], Gameranx, 25th October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A chassis patterned after Gray Fox's body circa the Shadow Moses incident, but functionally equivalent to recent cyborg bodies. Though it was termed an &quot;exoskeleton&quot; in those days before the advent of modern cyborg technology, it could not be taken on and off at will.&quot; Gray Fox skin description ''(Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance)''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hideo Kojima]], &quot;cyborg ninja was born from this [[Yoji Shinkawa|Shin-chan]]'s graffiti.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/hideo_kojima_en/statuses/129342773039079424 Twitter / HIDEO_KOJIMA]&lt;/ref&gt; His face portrait in the MSX2 version was modeled after actor [[Tom Berenger]]. In 2013, Kojima stated to be interested in developing a game with Gray Fox as the main playable character, although he does not assure it to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameoverviews.com/interview-with-hideo-kojima/|title=Interview with Hideo Kojima!

''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' put Cyborg Ninja at number sixth on the list of characters they wished to see in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

The '''Great White Shark''' or simply '''Great White''', formerly '''Warren White''', is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[American comic book|comic book]] [[supervillain]] owned by [[DC Comics]] who exists in that company's [[DC Universe]].

==Publication history==
Great White Shark first appeared in ''[[Arkham Asylum: Living Hell]]'' #1 (July, 2003) and was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Ryan Sook]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin story===
First appearing in ''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell'', crooked [[financier]] Warren White, known as the &quot;Great White Shark&quot; for his ruthlessness, [[embezzlement|embezzles]] millions from his company's [[pension fund]] and robs virtually all of the company's clients both working class and upper class of their life savings. A smug White manages to avoid prison by [[change of venue|transferring]] his case to [[Gotham City]] and successfully [[insanity defense|pleading insanity]] to avoid prison and speed up his chances of freedom, a strategy he is all too familiar with and convinced it will work. But the plea incenses the judge hearing his case, who is disgusted with White.

Realizing that White might have actually set up a trap for himself by pleading insanity, the judge sentences White to [[Arkham Asylum]] indefinitely. There, he suffers great indignities as the new inmate, or &quot;fish.&quot; His first cellmate is Death Rattle, a [[cult]] leader and [[mass murder]]er who plans to turn him into a [[human sacrifice]]. Early in his stay, [[Killer Croc]] slices a set of &quot;[[gill]]s&quot; into White's neck with his [[claw]]s, claiming the &quot;fish&quot; needs a set. Realizing his mistake in pleading insanity, White [[bribery|bribes]] his [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Anne Carver, into having him transferred to a minimum security prison. However, Carver is revealed to have been killed and replaced by Jane Doe some months before. Her boss, Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]] — who lost his pension due to White's business practices — orders all of White's transfer papers destroyed. Arkham calls White &quot;the worst person I've ever met&quot;, a sentiment shared by several individuals- including the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], who states that although he's killed people, &quot;[he] didn't steal their kid's college funds.&quot;

To survive the harassment and violence in Arkham, White allies himself with [[Two-Face]], becoming his &quot;coin boy.&quot; The relationship quickly ends, however, when Death Rattle threatens the pair; Two-Face's [[coin flip]] leads him to abandon White. White then befriends [[Humpty Dumpty (comics)|Humpty Dumpty]], a childlike murderer and [[savant syndrome|savant]], who arranges for White to become his cellmate just in time to head off Death Rattle's murder attempt.

During a [[prison riot]], White is [[assault]]ed and locked in [[Mr. Freeze]]'s [[wikt:subzero|subzero]] cell by Jane Doe, who was attempting to claim his identity and leave him for dead as she had done with Dr. Carver. His injuries, the result of horrific [[frostbite]], leave White deformed: his skin turns a pale white, and his nose, lips, ears, hair and several of his fingers fall off. These deformities, along with his set of &quot;gills,&quot; leave him resembling a real [[great white shark]], an effect which he further enhances by filing his teeth to points after he is driven insane by his ordeals.

Ironically, White, who was perfectly sane upon entering Arkham, is transformed into one of the &quot;freaks&quot; of Batman's [[rogues gallery]].  White now uses his business connections to serve as a liaison and [[fence (criminal)|fence]] for many of his fellow inmates.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell'' #1-6 (July–November 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===One Year Later===
White next appears in the storyline ''[[Batman: Face the Face]]'', which ran through ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #817-820 and ''[[Batman]]'' #651-654, as part of the larger ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline. In the storyline, in which Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] disappeared for a year, the Great White Shark had established himself as Gotham's reigning [[crime boss]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Detective Comics]]'' (vol. 1) #817-820 (May–August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Batman]]'' (vol. 1) #651-654 (May–August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a revenge plot against Two-Face for his earlier betrayal, he orders his chief [[Criminal|enforcer]], the [[Tally Man]], to kill several criminals associated with [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] — including [[Orca (comics)|Orca]], [[KGBeast]], [[Magpie (comics)|Magpie]] and [[Ventriloquist (comics)|The Ventriloquist]] — to [[frameup|frame]] the newly rehabilitated Harvey Dent for the murders. Batman eventually uncovers White's involvement in these crimes, but not in time to prevent Dent, driven insane once again by [[paranoia]], from disfiguring his own face once more and returning to a life of crime.

Despite his status as one of the city's most powerful criminals, the Great White Shark remains in Arkham, directing his empire from within his cell and using his imprisoned condition as a perfect [[alibi]]. He most recently appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #832, when Batman apprehends another villain who calls himself the Shark, a former member of the &quot;[[Terrible Trio]].&quot; When the Shark is sent to Arkham, the Great White Shark apparently plans to punish him for using the name that White had claimed for himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' (vol. 1) #832 (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Green Goblin''' is the alias of several fictional [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first and best known incarnation is [[Norman Osborn]], created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] to be the [[archenemy]] of [[Spider-Man]]. The Green Goblin is a [[Halloween]]-themed supervillain whose weapons resemble bats, ghosts and [[jack-o'-lantern]]s. Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: &quot;Of all the costumed villains who've plagued Spider-Man over the years, the most flat-out unhinged and terrifying of them all is the Green Goblin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'' (Collins &amp; Brown, 2004), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Goblin has appeared in several films including 2002's ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' as [[Norman Osborn]], and 2007's ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' and 2014's ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' as [[Harry Osborn]].

==Publication history==
[[File:Amazing Spider-Man no, 14 (1964) (cover).jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964), the Green Goblin's first appearance; the character originally used a turbo-fan-powered &quot;flying [[broom]]stick.&quot; Cover art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
According to Steve Ditko: &quot;Stan's synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew, on location, finding an [[Egypt]]ian-like [[sarcophagus]]. Inside was an ancient, [[mythology|mythological]] [[demon]], the Green Goblin. He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan's mythological demon into a human villain.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ditko&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Spider Time | first= Will |last=Murray | work= Starlog and Comics Scene present Spider-Man and other Comics Heroes|date=July 2002 | postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Goblin debuted in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Spider-Man's arch nemesis, the Green Goblin, as introduced to readers as the 'most dangerous foe Spidey's ever fought.' Writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko had no way of knowing how true that statement would prove to be in the coming years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time his identity was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which made a point of his [[secret identity]]. According to both Stan Lee and [[John Romita, Sr.]], who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, Ronin. ''Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution'', p. 107 (Bloomsbury, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cronin|first1=Brian|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #400 (Part 1)|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/04/comic-book-legends-revealed-400-part-1/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=14 February 2016|date=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter104&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 7|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee elaborated: &quot;At some point we had to tell the reader who The Green Goblin really was. And Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then what was the point of following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader. So that was a big argument we had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter104&quot;/&gt; However, Ditko's account contradicts Lee's: &quot;So I had to have some definite ideas: who he was, his profession and how he fit into the Spider-Man story world. I was even going to use an earlier, planted character associated with [[J. Jonah Jameson]]: he [was to] be [revealed as] the Green Goblin. It was like a subplot working its way until it was ready to play an active role.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ditko&quot;/&gt;

Ditko left the series with issue #38, before he could reveal the Goblin's identity, and Lee unmasked him in the next issue as Norman Osborn, a character who had been introduced two issues earlier as the father of [[Harry Osborn]]. [[John Romita, Sr.]], who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, recalled: {{blockquote|Stan wouldn't have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn't reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. I didn't know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin. I didn't know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog. I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn't think there was really much mystery about it. Looking back, I doubt the Goblin's identity would have been revealed in ''Amazing'' #39 if Ditko had stayed on.&lt;ref&gt;''Comics Creators on Spider-Man'', pg 29–30, Tom Defalco. (Titan Books, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2009, Ditko made a statement in his essay, &quot;The Ever Unwilling&quot; he wrote for the March issue of ''The Comics'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Now digest this: I knew from Day One, from the first GG story, who the GG would be. I absolutely knew because I planted him in J. Jonah Jameson’s businessmans club, it was where JJJ and the GG could be seen together. I planted them together in other stories where the GG would not appear in costume, action.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I wanted JJJ’s and the GG’s lives to mix for later story drama involving more than just the two characters”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I planted the GG’s son (same distinctive hair style) in the college issues for more dramatic involvement and storyline consequences”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“So how could there be any doubt, dispute, about who the GG had to turn out to be when unmasked?”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/04/comic-book-legends-revealed-400-part-1/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #400 (Part 1) {{!}} Comics Should Be Good @ CBR|date=2013-01-04|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the landmark story &quot;[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]&quot; (''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121-122), the Green Goblin kills [[Gwen Stacy]] and later perishes in a fight against Spider-Man. However, the story's writer, [[Gerry Conway]], had Harry Osborn adopt the Green Goblin identity in the aftermath of &quot;The Night Gwen Stacy Died&quot;, later remarking that &quot;I never had any intention of getting rid of the Green Goblin as a concept&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 14|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other characters would take on the Green Goblin identity, and writer [[Roger Stern]] later introduced the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man's archenemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creators&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Comics Creators on Spider-Man |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=1-84023-422-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a [[retcon]] during the &quot;[[Clone Saga]]&quot; determined that the original Green Goblin survived the events of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #122 and had been playing a behind-the-scenes role in Spider-Man's adventures since then.

==Biographies==

===Norman Osborn===
{{main|Norman Osborn}}
'''[[Norman Osborn]]''' is the main character connected with the alias who developed the equipment used by the other Green Goblins ever since he was exposed to the [[List of comic book drugs#Goblin Formula|Goblin Formula]].

===Harry Osborn===
{{main|Harry Osborn}}
'''[[Harry Osborn]]''', Norman Osborn's son, becomes the second Green Goblin. After being defeated and placed under the care of Dr. Bart Hamilton, Harry while under hypnosis reveals many Green Goblin secrets and Hamilton decides to become the third Green Goblin. Harry recovers and fights Hamilton until an explosion renders Harry [[amnesia]]c of his time as the Green Goblin and kills Hamilton.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASM180&quot;&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #180&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Harry's memories return&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #177-180&lt;/ref&gt; and he uses a new stronger Goblin serum to augment his power, but dies from it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #200&lt;/ref&gt; Harry would later return thanks to the machinations of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in &quot;[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]&quot;.

===Bart Hamilton===
'''Dr. Barton &quot;Bart&quot; Hamilton''' was a psychologist born in [[Scarsdale, New York]]. Before his death, Harry is put under the medical care of Dr. Hamilton, who manages to make Harry bury his vendetta and identity as the Goblin in his [[subconscious]] via [[hypnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #174&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hamilton uses Harry's secrets to become the third Green Goblin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #176&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harry has no knowledge of where the Green Goblin strength-enhancing formula is, and Hamilton is thus unable to locate it. He hatches an elaborate plot to kill [[Silvermane]], but Harry Osborn resumes the Green Goblin identity to stop him. They battle and Hamilton is accidentally killed by a bomb with which he meant to kill Spider-Man, and Harry becomes amnesiac.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASM180&quot;/&gt; Years later, there was speculation that Hamilton was the Hobgoblin but this is disproved.&lt;ref&gt;''Hobgoblin Lives'' #1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

A Green Goblin that is presumably Hamilton appears as a member of the second incarnation of the [[Legion of the Unliving]], created by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. After being pitted against the Avengers, the group and their master are vanquished by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Annual'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Bart Hamilton's Green Goblin form is cloned by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] and his company New U Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Clone Conspiracy'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phil Urich===
{{main|Phil Urich}}

After Harry's insanity relapses and he becomes the Green Goblin again on numerous occasions until he dies from the side effects of a modified Goblin serum, his equipment and the Green Goblin identity are then briefly used by '''[[Phil Urich|Philip Benjamin &quot;Phil&quot; Urich]]''' (nephew of [[Ben Urich]] of the [[Daily Bugle]]) trying to gain a reputation as a [[superhero]], although he is sometimes seen as being as maniacal as his villainous predecessors. When his equipment is damaged during a battle against a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crossover, Phil is unable to repair or replace it and the fourth Green Goblin thereafter retires. He later forms the team [[Loners|Excelsior]]. Currently Phil has become the new Hobgoblin, but after being caught by Spider-Man he is broken out of jail and becomes the Goblin Knight a servant of the Green Goblin.

===Nameless construct===
After returning from the dead, Norman begins trying to convince the public that he was never the Green Goblin, so he has an associate named Doctor Angst genetically engineer a new Green Goblin, one slavishly devoted to him, to help his case.&lt;ref name = &quot;PPSM18&quot;&gt;''Peter Parker: Spider Man'' vol. 2, #18&lt;/ref&gt; Norman uses the Goblin as a [[bodyguard]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #259-261&lt;/ref&gt; to torment Spider-Man,&lt;ref&gt;''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #88&lt;/ref&gt; and in ploys (such as kidnapping [[Normie Osborn]] for [[ransom]]) designed to draw public sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #255&lt;/ref&gt;

After Norman is incapacitated by [[The Gathering of Five and The Final Chapter|the Gathering of Five]], the Goblin is left alone, and begins to degenerate due to no longer having access to the formula required to keep him stable. The Goblin goes after Harry Osborn's wife [[Liz Allan]] in a desperate bid to find a cure for his condition, but is driven off by Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #18&lt;/ref&gt; During a second attempt to capture Liz, the Goblin unmasks himself in front of Spider-Man (shuffling through a variety of faces, the most prominent being Harry, after doing so) and melts into a pile of goo as he claims Norman would return.&lt;ref name = &quot;PPSM18&quot;/&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
{{anchor|Weapons_as_the_Green_Goblin}}
In his first appearances, the Green Goblin seems to be a normal man (albeit very nimble and athletic) who gets his powers from his many gadgets. Samir, Amitesh, and miraj were at his aid.  In later appearances, it is established that due to the &quot;Goblin Formula&quot;, Norman and any successor to the Goblin persona possesses superhuman strength (lifting 9 tons under optimal conditions), increased speed, reflexes, endurance, and healing rate. Though much slower than the likes of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], he can regenerate damaged tissue and organs. However, if seriously wounded, it would leave scars on his body. His intelligence has been enhanced to gifted levels, though at the price of his sanity. His involvement with the Gathering of the Five loosened his grip on reality, though he is able to maintain his sanity via chemically treated dermal patches. When not impaired by [[mental illness]], Osborn is a cunning businessman, masterful strategist, and highly skilled in electronics, mechanics, engineering and chemistry. The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He travels on his [[bat]]-shaped &quot;Goblin Glider&quot;, an incredibly fast and maneuverable rocket glider equipped with various armaments. Other weapons the Goblin uses include incendiary Pumpkin Bombs, smoke- and gas-emitting grenades resembling ghosts and jack-'o'-lanterns, razor-edged [[boomerang]]-like throwing weapons called razor bats and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity at nearly 10,000 [[volt]]s. He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof [[mail (armour)|chainmail]] with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses.

===Goblin Glider===
In the Green Goblin's first appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #14, he rides a steel, rocket powered wingless broomstick, not a glider.  In issue #17, his second appearance, he changes it to the familiar bat-shaped glider.  The Goblin Glider's controls and [[microprocessor]] are located behind the head of the glider. The pilot is attached to the glider via [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] clasps on the wings of the glider. It has great maneuverability and is steered mostly by leaning, but manual controls are available behind the head of the glider. The Green Goblin later added radio-linked voice controls to his mask. Its top speed is {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h}}, and it can support about {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}}, though it could lift far more for brief periods. Flying at top speed with a full load and a full fuel tank would deplete its fuel supply in about an hour.

In the Goblin's later appearances, the glider possesses a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher.

===Pumpkin Bombs, Ghost Bombs, and the &quot;Bag of Tricks&quot;===
A [[grenade]] used by the Green Goblin, the Pumpkin Bomb resembles a miniature [[Jack-o'-lantern]] and, when thrown, ignites almost soundlessly and produces enough heat to melt through a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} thick sheet of steel. The Goblin carries these and a variety of other weapons, such as razor bats (akin to bladed boomerangs) and miniature &quot;Ghost Bombs&quot; in an over-the-shoulder [[satchel]] he calls his &quot;Bag Of Tricks&quot;. The Green Goblin has a range of other &quot;Pumpkin Bombs&quot; and &quot;Ghost Bombs&quot; at his disposal, including smoke-and gas-emitting bombs. Some release [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] gases, while others emit a specially-created mixture that neutralizes [[Spider-Man]]'s spider-sense for a limited period of time.  Still others emit a flame-retarding gas, which the Goblin uses against the [[Human Torch]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, issue #17.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these are covered in a light plastic coating.

==Groups==

===Goblinettes===
Some time after Harry's death, his son Normie is abducted by a trio of mysterious female Goblins. With the aid of [[Ben Urich]] and [[Molten Man]], Spider-Man discovers that these &quot;Goblinettes&quot; are robots created by Harry, and controlled by a supercomputer containing copies of Harry and Norman's minds. The Goblinettes are destroyed along with the computer, which had been programmed to expose Normie to the same version of the Goblin Serum that killed Harry, in attempt to create a new Green Goblin.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order of the Goblin===
An offshoot of the Scriers cult founded by Norman, consisting of only his most loyal followers.

===Goblin Gangs===
Following Norman Osborn's [[Dark Reign (comics)|rise]] and [[Siege (comics)|fall]] from power, a number of Goblin Gangs sprang up across America. Composed mostly of [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] who agreed with his plans to remove the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardians]] from the country, they wear purple clothes, green face makeup and have goblin-based tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #649&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vin Gonzales]] was revealed to have received one of these tattoos while in prison when he passed a message from [[Norman Osborn|Norman]] to [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] about Stanley, Harry's newborn son.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #647&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goblin Underground===
The Goblin Underground is a group of organized crime composed of Goblin-themed villains led by Goblin King against their nemesis [[Doctor Octopus|Spider-Man]].

=== War Goblins ===

In the eight month [[timeskip]] that occurred subsequent to the events of ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'', a heavily bandaged arms dealer claiming to be Norman Osborn began selling Green Goblin-based costumes and equipment on the [[black market]], establishing [[Private army|private armies]] of &quot;War Goblins&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott|penciller = Giuseppe Camuncoli|inker = Cam Smith|colorist = Marte Gracia|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe|story = High Priority|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 1|issue = #4|date = 9 December 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of the Green Goblin}}
As a fictional character, the Green Goblin has appeared in a number of media, from [[comic book]]s to [[film]]s and [[television program|television series]]. Each version of the character is typically established within its own [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] within [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified. Various versions of the Goblin are depicted in works such as Marvel's [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate line]] and ''[[Earth X]]''.

Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=2151490 Schnittbericht: Green River Killer]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based upon the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Gary Ridgway]].&lt;ref&gt;My Revelations [http://www.myrevelations.de/index.php?section=reviews&amp;module=dvdreviews&amp;submodule=review_detail&amp;reviewid=469&amp;PHPSESSID=416b2a244ea453461eea6473f64d2d5c Green River Killer: DVD Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Based on the true story of serial murderer [[Gary Ridgway]], the film depicts how he would approach prostitutes in bars, then take them to his homes and brutally kill them.

Soon the investigating police officers are on his track.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=6997663 CD Universe – Green River Killer DVD Movie]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filming==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
The documentary footage is of the real Gary Ridgway confessing to the killings.

The flashback of Ridgway's fictional &quot;mentor,&quot; Boris, has a distinctly different look and atmosphere compared with the rest of the movie. That is because the footage was not shot by director Ulli Lommel but by [[German people|German]] actor-director &quot;Marian Dora,&quot; a pseudonym for the physician who began making gory horror films around the same time Lommel directed ''Green River Killer.'' Dora made ''[[Cannibal (2006 film)|Cannibal – Aus dem Tagebuch des Kannibalen]]'', for example. Dora, who also worked on Lommel's ''[[Zombie Nation (film)|Zombie Nation]]'', in this flashback directs actor Carsten Frank as he strangles a woman.

''Green River Killer'' was the second in a series of direct-to-[[DVD]] titles directed by Lommel and released by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] under its Artisan label. The first was ''[[Zodiac Killer (film)|Zodiac Killer]]'' (2005). ''Green River Killer'' would soon to be followed by ''[[BTK Killer (film)|BTK Killer]]'' (2005) and ''[[Killer Pickton (film)|Killer Pickton]]'' (2005). Other direct-to-DVD movies directed by Lommel and featuring serial killers would follow in 2007 and 2008.

Ridgway's home in the movie, which is a residence located in [[Marina del Rey, California]], was also the house inhabited by &quot;Producer McCoon&quot; in ''[[Black Dahlia (film)|Black Dahlia]]'' (2006).

==Storyline==

===Arrival of Dr. Evans===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}} 
Renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Greg Evans (Tilford) arrives in fictional [[Llanview]] in June 2009 at the request of [[Clint Buchanan]] ([[Jerry verDorn]]) for a paid [[consultant (medicine)|consult]] on performing [[spinal surgery]] on his nephew [[Matthew Buchanan|Matthew]] ([[Eddie Alderson]]). Months earlier, Greg's younger sister [[Destiny Evans|Destiny]] (Shenell Edmonds) asked for a favor to help Matthew, and when Greg arrives, Destiny comes to realize Greg returned home from his successful career abroad because of Clint's check and not Destiny's letters.

Matthew's parents [[Bo Buchanan|Bo]] ([[Robert S. Woods]] and [[Nora Hanen|Nora Buchanan]] refuse to allow the surgery on [[minor (law)|minor]] Matthew, and Greg proceeds to leave town before being guilted to stay by his brother [[Shaun Evans (One Life to Live)|Shaun]] ([[Sean Ringgold]]) and Shaun's girlfriend and Matthew's sister [[Rachel Gannon]] ([[Daphnee Duplaix]]). Matthew successfully sues his parents for the right to authorize surgery, and Greg tell Matthew that he would testify on his behalf, angering Matthew's Rachel.

Greg and Rachel kiss after Greg testifies in court for Matthew, and Rachel decides to break up with Shaun. Before Rachel tells Shaun, he is shot in the head on bodyguard duty for the [[Cramer family]]. Greg performs successful [[trauma surgery]] on Shaun, who goes into a brief coma. After tests, Greg determines he left a bullet fragment lodged in his brain. Devastated, Greg vows to never perform surgery again and recommends Matthew to a [[Seattle]]-based surgeon. Matthew soon agrees when Greg agrees to supervise the procedure.

Greg prepares to leave for Seattle to observe the surgery with Rachel in tow, angering his mother [[Phylicia Evans|Phylicia]] who was aware of Greg's affair with his brother's girlfriend. After Mrs. Evans confronts Rachel, she goes on a date with Shaun where she reveals herself not to be in love with him. Shaun senses the bond between Rachel and Greg and asks if they are romantically involved, a question Rachel dodges. Later, Rachel tells Greg she did not want to pursue a relationship with Greg for fear of hurting Shaun. Shaun sees them kiss and lashes out at them, warning Rachel that Greg would eventually bore of her and move on to the next woman. After much begging from Destiny, Shaun asks Greg as a brother to perform help in Matthew's surgery, and he obliges.

Rachel moves into an apartment with her [[social worker]] colleague [[Schuyler Joplin]] ([[Scott Clifton]]), a move with leaves Greg jealous. When a bottle of [[Oxytocin]] goes lost at Llanview Hospital, Greg tells Rachel, who insists on Schuyler's innocence. Greg and Rachel soon break it off after Rachel relentlessly defends Schuyler, and she leaves Llanview for [[Chicago]].

===Téa and Charlene===
[[Téa Delgado]] ([[Florencia Lozano]]) soon finds herself in Greg's care after fainting in court, and Greg diagnoses her with a [[brain tumor]]. Greg and Téa proceed for months with [[chemotherapy]] but to no avail. As Téa's mental condition apparently deteriorates, Greg suggests Téa die in privacy at a hospice in [[St. Kitts]]. It soon becomes clear Téa was not suffering a brain tumor but that Greg drugged her after being ordered in a [[blackmail]] by [[Elijah Clarke (One Life to Live)|Elijah &quot;Eli&quot; Clarke]] ([[Matt Walton]]) to do so and kill her.

[[Victor Lord, Jr.|Todd]] ([[Trevor St. John]]) and Téa's daughter [[Danielle Manning]], arrive to see their dying loved one only for Greg to tell them she'd already died. Feeling guilty, Greg reveals he moved Téa to a clinic in Cherryvale, [[Pennsylvania]] to hide her from Eli. After Téa awakes from an [[induced coma]], Greg lies and tells Téa she had been miraculously cured. Greg soon returns to St. Kitts greeted by Eli, who he finds him unconscious with a pool of blood beneath his head.

Attempting to perform surgery on Eli, who wakes up and refuses treatment. Greg then proceeded to inject an Eli with a lethal dose of [[morphine]], however Greg mistakenly receives the dose instead and is rushed back to Llanview in a coma. Eli became aware that Greg had survived and attempted to kill him by drugging him but is stopped by Dr. [[Vivian Wright (One Life to Live)|Vivian Wright]] (Kearran Giovanni). Wanting to come clean, Greg reveals to his parents his desire to truth to reveal Destiny's paternity to she and Shaun.

As they all stood together, Greg's parents Phylicia and [[Richard Evans (One Life to Live)|Richard Evans]] ([[Frankie Faison]]) revealed her to be Greg's daughter. They soon divulge [[backstory]] that after Greg began [[medical school]], he had gotten a girl named Charlene pregnant, but he did not want the child, so Phylicia and Richard agreed to raise Destiny as their own child. At the time of conception, Charlene was Shaun's girlfriend and it is uncovered Greg killed Charlene after a confrontation, disposing of the body.

Greg soon reveals this truth to an upset Destiny. With help from Nora, Greg receives a sentence of six years in Statesville Prison for Charlene's murder, apologizing to Destiny as he is led to lockup November 29, 2010.

'''Ser Gregor Clegane''', nicknamed '''The Mountain''', is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[fantasy]] novels by American author [[George R. R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. He is a retainer to [[House Lannister]]. An enormous man, he is well known for his size, prowess in battle and cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/WatchersOTWall/status/510783858657071105|title=The Mountain in Belfast, and Game of Thrones filming in Split continues despite flooding
|publisher=Watchers On The Wall|date=September 13, 2014|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Gregor is the older brother of [[Sandor Clegane]], from the fictional kingdom of [[Westeros]]. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998), ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000) and in [[A Dance with Dragons]] (2011) as Ser Robert Strong.

Ser Gregor Clegane is a huge [[knight]] and the elder brother of Sandor Clegane. Called &quot;'''The Mountain That Rides'''&quot;, he is known for his incredibly cruel nature and uncontrollable temper. His size and strength make him a fearsome warrior, and he has earned a reputation for cruelty and brutality. He is able to wield a two-handed sword one handed. When they were children, Gregor shoved Sandor's face into a brazier, gruesomely scarring him.

Gregor Clegane is portrayed by [[Conan Stevens]] in [[Game of Thrones (season 1)|season one]], by [[Ian Whyte (actor)|Ian Whyte]] in [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|season two]], and by [[Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson]] in seasons [[Game of Thrones (season 4)|four]], [[Game of Thrones (season 5)|five]], and [[Game of Thrones (season 6)|six]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBOCast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=HBO: Game of Thrones: Bio|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|publisher=[[HBO]]|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character description ==
Ser Gregor Clegane, known as the Mountain That Rides, or simply the Mountain, is the older brother of [[Sandor Clegane]] and is a [[vassal]] to [[Tywin Lannister]].{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix}} His size and strength make him a fearsome warrior, and he has earned a reputation for brutality. When they were children, Gregor shoved Sandor's face into a [[brazier]] for using his toy, gruesomely scarring him. Over the course of his service to [[House Lannister]], he has committed numerous war crimes, but he is most infamous for the rape and murder of the Targaryen royal family. Clegane was one of the first Lannister soldiers to enter [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]] during its sack at the end of [[Robert Baratheon]]'s rebellion. He raped and murdered Princess Elia, and murdered her children Rhaenys and Aegon, a grudge [[House Martell]] still bears at the onset of ''[[A Game of Thrones]]''.

== Overview ==
Gregor Clegane is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as [[Cersei Lannister]]. Gregor is mostly a background character in the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=[[HBO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storylines ==
[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of House Clegane supporters.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing three black dogs on a field of yellow.|Coat of arms of House Clegane]]
=== In the books ===
In ''A Game of Thrones'', [[Tywin Lannister]] sends him to raid the [[Riverlands (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Riverlands]] in retaliation for Catelyn Stark's abduction of Tyrion. [[Beric Dondarrion]] is sent to arrest Gregor, but Gregor ambushes and kills him.{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Chapter 43: Eddard XI}} He and his men continue raiding the Riverlands throughout ''A Clash of Kings''. When [[Tyrion Lannister]] demands a [[trial by combat]], the accuser [[Cersei Lannister]] chooses Gregor as her champion. Elia's brother [[Oberyn Martell]] is named Tyrion's champion for his own agenda to expose Gregor as a murderer. Oberyn wounds him with a poisoned spear, but the Mountain is ultimately victorious as he admits to murdering Elia and Aegon before crushing Oberyn's skull. Gregor's body is given to [[Qyburn]] for experimentation and he is reported to be dead with his head sent to [[Dorne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Dorne]] as a peace offering to [[Doran Martell]] in the wake of his brother's death. But following Cersei's walk of atonement, she gains a bodyguard named Ser Robert Strong who is of similar enormous stature as Gregor, and whose body is completely covered in armor.

=== In the show ===
In Season 1, Tywin Lannister sends him to raid the Riverlands. Beric Dondarrion is sent to arrest Gregor. When war breaks out, Gregor is given command of Tywin's vanguard and left flank and leads his men through intimidation. In Season 2 he is left to command Harrenhal in Tywin's absence and to find and destroy &quot;The Brotherhood Without Banners&quot;, invoking the escape of Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie from Harrenhal. He later abandons the castle after slaughtering the prisoners and is defeated by Edmure Tully at the Stone Mill, but manages to escape back to the Westerlands. Robb chides his uncle, having planned to draw the Mountain into a trap of his own making to be captured or killed.

In season 4, Gregor is chosen as Cersei's champion for Tyrion's trial by combat, and fights Oberyn Martell, Tyrion's champion who wants to kill Clegane as revenge for the needless murder of his sister, Elia Martell Targaryen. Oberyn inflicts several serious injuries on Clegane with his poisoned spear, but Clegane eventually kills Oberyn by crushing his skull, while admitting that he did rape Elia, killed her children and enjoyed it, before collapsing from his own injuries. It is later revealed that Clegane has been poisoned with manticore venom, a poison that Oberyn had laced his weapon with, and that he is slowly dying. Cersei enlists ex-maester Qyburn to save him, though Qyburn claims that the procedure will &quot;change&quot; Clegane. The procedure is seemingly a success, as Gregor has become active again and joins the Kingsguard as a personal knight for Cersei, though the procedure has changed his physical appearance and his behavior. In the sixth season, under the name of Ser Robert Strong, Gregor continues to act as Cersei's bodyguard to intimidate all those who may bother or mock her. After Cersei destroys the Great Sept of Baelor and retakes power, she has Gregor torture Septa Unella in revenge for the nun torturing her during her time in prison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4127">'''Gregorio &quot;Goyo&quot; Cárdenas Hernández''' ([[Mexico City]], 1915 – [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], 2 August 1999), also known as the '''strangler of Tacuba''' (''estrangulador de Tacuba''), was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[spree killer]]. He was the first multiple murderer whose case was widely published in the Mexican media, and became a national celebrity.

==Early life==
Cárdenas Hernández was born in Mexico City a family originating from the state of [[Veracruz]]. In part due to an [[encephalitis]] infection, he showed abnormal behavior as a child, including [[cruelty to animals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blogspot&quot;&gt;Escrito con Sangre, ''[http://goyocardenas0.blogspot.com/ Gregorio &quot;Goyo&quot; Cárdenas: &quot;El Estrangulador de Tacuba&quot;]''&lt;/ref&gt; Cárdenas received a scholarship from [[Petróleos Mexicanos]] to study [[chemistry]] at the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM).&lt;ref name=&quot;Avitia&quot;&gt;Antonio Avitia Hernández, ''Corrido Histórico Mexicano, Tomo V (1936-1985)'' (Mexico City: Porrúa, 1998) 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Cárdenas Hernández committed his murders in August and September 1942. On 15 August 1942 he was visited in his house in the [[Tacuba (Mexico)|Tacuba]] neighborhood of Mexico City by 16-year-old [[prostitute]] María de los Ángeles González. After having sex with her, Cárdenas strangled De los Ángeles and buried her body in his garden. In the following weeks he also murdered prostitutes Rosa Reyes and Raquel Martínez de León, both aged 16, and finally 19-year-old fellow chemistry student Graciela Arias Ávalos. His neighbors started to get suspicious and informed the police. Shortly before the police exhumed the bodies, Cárdenas had himself committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]], where he was arrested on 7 September 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avitia&quot;/&gt;

Cárdenas was incarcerated in the notorious [[Lecumberri]] prison. During his trial Cárdenas pleaded guilty and was given a [[life sentence]]. He escaped prison in 1947 and fled to [[Oaxaca]], but eventually was rearrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogspot&quot;/&gt;

==Fame==
Cárdenas became a celebrity in Mexico, being the first multiple murderer receiving widespread media attention in that country. In the years following his murders there were reports of several [[Copycat crimes|copycat murderers]] imitating his crimes and an (illegal) [[pornographic movie]] based on his story was made. Cárdenas himself wrote three books while in prison and was regularly questioned and investigated by the country's top [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] and [[criminology|criminologists]]. Cárdenas was allowed to pursue psychiatry and law studies while in prison. He learned to play the [[piano]], wrote [[poetry]], and even married in prison. His wife bore him four children.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogspot&quot;/&gt;

In 1976 Cárdenas was pardoned by president [[Luis Echeverría]]. He was invited by interior secretary [[Mario Moya]] to give a speech in the [[Congress of the Union]], where he was celebrated as a hero. He was hailed as a &quot;great example&quot; and a &quot;clear case of rehabilitation&quot;. Cárdenas completed his law studies and worked as a [[lawyer]] until his death in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogspot&quot;/&gt;

A chance meeting with [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] in a backstreet bar in Mexico City inspired the psycho-magician to create the 1989 film ''[[Santa Sangre]]'', based loosely on Cárdenas's life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''Gregory John 'Bluey' Brazel''' (born 17 November 1954)
is a convicted [[Australia]]n [[serial killer]], [[arsonist]], and armed [[robber]] currently serving three consecutive [[life sentence]]s for the murders of [[prostitute]]s Sharon Taylor and Roslyn Hayward in 1990, and the murder of [[Mordialloc, Victoria|Mordialloc]] hardware store owner Mildred Hanmer during an armed robbery in 1982 for which he confessed some eighteen years later.

Brazel is often described as one of the most manipulative and violent prisoners in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s prison system,&lt;ref name=killerpayout&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20409851-5006785,00.html Killer gets compensation payout], [[The Australian]], 14 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=killerlist&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20673356-661,00.html Killer caught with jail list], [[Herald Sun|Sunday Herald Sun]], 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and was estimated to be worth more than A$500,000 in 2000. He will be eligible for [[parole]] in 2020.

==Early life==
Enlisted in Australian Army 1974. Trained at 1RTB (Kapooka) 14Platoon B Company. Posted September 1974 to Australian Army Medical Training School, Healesville, Victoria.

In 1976, Brazel took five [[Private (rank)|private]]s hostage during an army medical corps exercise in [[Healesville]]. Shots were fired before Brazel was persuaded to release the hostages. He was later dishonorably discharged.

==Murder of Sharon Taylor==
On 28 May 1990, while on early release from prison, Brazel murdered prostitute Sharon Taylor. Her body was found in a shallow grave at [[Barongarook, Victoria]], south of [[Colac, Victoria|Colac]] on 23 September 1990.&lt;ref name=VSC2005&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/vic/VSCA/2005/56.html R v Brazel], [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], 22 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Roslyn Hayward==
On 13 September 1990, Brazel murdered prostitute Roslyn Hayward at [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sorrento]]. Her body was not discovered until 1 October 1990.

==Murder of Mildred Hanmer==
Mildred Teresa Hanmer was shot in the chest on 20 September 1982 during an [[armed robbery]] on her Mordialloc hardware and gift store. She later died in the [[Alfred Hospital]] from her injuries. Her murder remained unsolved until August 2000.

On 18 August 2000, Brazel voluntarily confessed to the 1982 murder, seeking to make a deal with police officers that no life term would be imposed before agreeing to make a statement.&lt;ref name=VSC2005/&gt;

==Prison life==
Brazel has continued to regularly offend while imprisoned and is often described as being manipulative and violent. In November 1991, Brazel took a staff member hostage while imprisoned at the [[HM Melbourne Assessment Prison]] when he learned of his impending transfer to [[HM Prison Pentridge]].

In 2003, Brazel conned an elderly woman into depositing more than A$30,000 into a [[Totalisator Agency Board|TAB]] telephone betting account for his own personal use.&lt;ref name=killerpayout/&gt; In 2006, Brazel was awarded A$12,000 in damages in an out of court settlement after suffering a violent attack with a broken bottle while imprisoned at Melbourne's privately operated [[Port Phillip Correctional Centre]] in [[Laverton, Victoria|Laverton]] in May 2001.&lt;ref name=killerpayout/&gt; In October 2006, Brazel was caught collecting personal information relating to senior prison staff.&lt;ref name=killerlist/&gt;

==Summary of criminal convictions==
During the period of March 1983 until August 2000 Brazel was convicted of 37 offences from fifteen court appearances. Offences since 1992 occurred while Brazel was in prison custody apart from the 2005 conviction for murder which occurred in 1982.

'''Gregory Clement''' (1594&amp;ndash;1660) was an [[England|English]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) and one of the [[regicide]]s of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

Clement was the son of John Clement, a merchant and one time Mayor of [[Plymouth]]. After working in [[India]] for the [[British East India Company]], Clement returned to [[London]] and on outbreak of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] supported [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

In 1648, he became an MP for [[Fowey (UK Parliament constituency)|Fowey]] in [[Cornwall]]. In January 1649, as a commissioner of the [[High Court of Justice]] at the [[Charles I of England#Trial and execution|trial of King Charles]], he was [[List of regicides of Charles I|54th of the 59 signatories]] on the death warrant of the King — although his signature appears to have been written over an erased signature.

He was dismissed from the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1652  over a scandal involving his maidservant. This may have been engineered by [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]] and other political opponents.

Like all of the other 59 men who signed the death warrant for Charles I, Clement was in grave danger when [[Charles II of England]] was restored to the throne. Some of the 59 fled England but Clement was arrested, put on trial, and found guilty of high treason. He was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] at [[Charing Cross]] on 17 October 1660.

According to [[Mark Twain's Autobiography|Mark Twain's autobiography]], an irate Virginian correspondent called him a ''descendant of a regicide'' (apparently referring to Gregory Clement) and berated him for supporting the&amp;ndash;as he called it&amp;ndash;aristocratic Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Twain, ''op.cit.'', p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressing on a diary entry that spoke of a desire to kill [[ad infinitum]] &quot;all over the world&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton Keynes Citizen 2011&quot;/&gt; he eventually went on a murder spree on 28 January 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/beds/bucks/herts/3322525.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Working his way through a compiled hit list he first paid visit to Stewart Johnson who escaped as kitchen fitters were working in his home.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/community/killer_s_letters_reveal_hit_list_1_2516667&lt;/ref&gt; Davis then continued down the list to Stantonbury, to the home of Dorothy Rogers.

'''Gregory Allan Despres''' was convicted of the [[murder]]s of Fred Fulton, 74, and Veronica &quot;Verna&quot; Decarie, 70, of [[Minto, New Brunswick]], Canada, which occurred on April 23, 2005. On March 5, 2008, the Court found Despres guilty, but not criminally responsible for his actions at the time.

== Early life ==

Despres was born in Minto, New Brunswick in July 1982. As a young child, his mother, Jenny Despres, separated from Despres' father. Despres lived a nomadic existence nearly his entire life.

In his youth, he moved with his mother to Massachusetts.By the age of 16, Despres' mother began noticing changes in his personality which she dismissed as teenage rebellion. At 17, Despres moved back to Minto.

Despres also severed ties with his mother for almost 2 years, until she herself had returned to Minto. By this time Despres had become isolated from society locking himself away in his residence for long periods of time rarely being seen by outsiders. His mother was concerned, asked him if he was doing drugs. Despres denied it. Despres state continued to deteriorate beyond that point.

== Murders ==

On the evening April 23, 2005, Despres left his trailer and traveled a short distance on foot to the residence of Fred Fulton and Veronica Decarie.  Despres gained access to the house by cutting open the screen of one door with a knife and kicking in the second door.

Despres went to the couple's bedroom where he stabbed Decarie to death. While Fulton attempted to escape the house, he only made it to the porch before being overpowered by Despres.  Despres then  dragged Fulton back to the kitchen where he decapitated him.  While it was originally reported to the media that Despres had thrown Fulton's head out the back door, it was actually found under the kitchen table in a pillowcase.

== Fugitive ==

Shortly after the murders, Despres packed up a car with the murder weapons and drove toward the United States.  The car was later found in a gravel pit near the Canada-U.S. border and identified as Fulton's.  On April 25, 2005, one day before the bodies were discovered, Despres arrived at the Calais, Maine, border crossing.  He presented himself to the U.S. border guards while carrying a homemade sword, a hatchet, a knife, brass knuckles and a chainsaw stained with what appeared to be blood.&lt;ref name=CBC2005&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/man-with-bloody-chainsaw-let-into-u-s-1.564430  Man with bloody chainsaw let into U.S.], at [[CBC.ca]]; published June 8, 2005; retrieved July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; At the border, Despres boasted of being an [[assassination|assassin]] for the United States government and of having killed 700.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The weapons were confiscated and Despres was fingerprinted.  Although it was determined that Despres was due in court to be sentenced for an assault conviction, Despres held U.S. citizenship and under US law, the officers could not legally compel Despres to return to Canada.  Although contact was made with the RCMP, they had no other information that would have allowed the officers to detain Despres.  The bodies had not yet been discovered.  He was therefore properly permitted to enter the United States.

There were however other grounds for possibly detaining Despres that were not acted upon by the border patrol agents. &quot;[[Joseph Gutheinz]], a University of Phoenix criminal justice professor said they could have arrested Despres for lying to a customs officer. The comment about 700 kills should have tipped them that he was not telling the truth, he said.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-06-11-canada-border-workers_x.htm?csp=34} Canadian senator criticizes border workers.Associated Press, June 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Gutheinz, a retired Senior Special Agent who had previously served with three Federal agencies also said &quot;if the customs agents wanted to exercise their discretion in regard to a person who they believed might be mentally ill, there was also a non-criminal option. In Maine, as in many states, there is a protective custody statute, which permits law enforcement officers to take into custody individuals they have reasonable grounds to believe may be an imminent threat to themselves or others. This authority to apprehend and process a person is designed to permit a psychological evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=5052002e-0002-45ff-aed0-816ee9515cc2} They could have stopped him: U.S. Customs officials could have arrested Gregory Despres. Why didn't they?. National Post, January 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, Despres hitchhiked south to [[Massachusetts]].  On April 27, 2005, a Mattapoisett, MA police officer spotted Despres wandering on the side of the road. During a routine check for outstanding [[Arrest warrant|warrant]]s, it was found that Despres was expected in court that day in [[Fredericton]], [[New Brunswick]] for an [[assault]] on Fulton's son-in-law in August 2004.

The day prior, Fulton's daughter discovered the bodies of her father and Decarie at their residence in Minto, New Brunswick.  The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) quickly suspected Despres and learned later he had been arrested in the United States and was currently jailed in [[Boston]]. Despres was [[extradition|extradited]] from Boston to Fredericton on September 15, 2005.

== First trial ==

[[File:Downtown Fredericton.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fredericton Justice Building and City Hall.]]
Despres' trial was originally scheduled for September 5, 2006. On August 4, 2006, however, Despres fired his lawyer, Randy Maillet, with whom he disagreed on how the defense should be presented. This caused a major delay and the trial date was moved to January 8, 2007.

The Despres trial would be heard by a judge and not a jury. [[Judy Clendening|Judge Judy Clendening]] would preside over the case. The prosecution focused its case on the blood trail, [[DNA]] evidence, and his relations with Fulton. The prosecution stated Despres and Fulton were constantly fighting over the waterline, a conflict worsened by Despres' use of [[recreational drugs]].

On February 1, Despres lashed out at his new lawyer, Ed Derrah, accusing him of working for [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Saddam Hussein]]. He demanded his lawyer be fired, but Clendenning refused his request.  Derrah requested his client be sent for a [[psychological evaluation]]; Clendenning agreed and the trial was ended.

Hearings were held on April 24, 25 and 26, 2007. During this time, one expert, Dr. Scott Theriault, said that Despres was unfit to stand trial due to the fact he believe Despres had [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Jeannie, Despres' mother, backed this up by saying her son seemed to act strangely since the age of 17. Another expert testified that Despres was in fact fit to stand trial and that medication could help any [[mental disorder]] he was facing. Clendenning disagreed with that theory and ruled that Despres was unfit to stand trial on April 26.

On July 11, 2007, Despres was brought before the provincial mental health review board which found that he had responded well to treatment and was in fact fit to stand trial.  A new trial was promptly ordered.

== Second trial ==
Despres' second began on November 5, 2007 and was overheard by Justice Grant. [[Evidence]] from the first trial was admitted into court.

On the second day of the trial, Despres' grandfather, Adolph, testified that Despres had repeatedly tried to join the military and had been rejected every time. He also testified that Despres would stay in his room for hours talking to himself. Also presented this day was a video of the crime scene which showed graphic images of Fulton's house. The video clearly showed blood on the walls of the bedroom and Decaries' body on the floor, it also showed the blood smeared kitchen where Fulton's decapitated body was sprawled out. It then showed the pillow case in which Fulton's head was found.

On day three, Fulton's grandson, Fred Mowat, testified before the court that his grandfather feared Despres and often required medications to sleep at night. Mowat also testified that he and Despres had had a fight in 2004 over noise coming from his trailer, and that Despres pulled a knife on him. Charges were filed in this incident and Despres was found guilty (it was prior to being sentenced for this crime that Despres allegedly committed the murders of Fulton and Decarie and fled across the U.S. border).  On day four, the court heard from one witness who had seen Despres cross the U.S. border and another witness who had picked him up hitchhiking and drove him south.

On November 16, the court adjourned Despres' trial until January 2008, allowing counsel time to prepare expert witnesses.

On January 28, 2008, the trial continued with defense presenting Despres' mother and Dr. '''Scott''' Theriault, a psychiatrist, as witnesses. The testimony and evidence given went to the issue of whether the defendant's mental state could allow him to be criminally responsible in the case he did commit the murders.  On January 29, 2008, Despres' psychiatrist, Dr. '''Louis''' Theriault, also presented evidence going to the issue of Despres' mental state (it is coincidence that both psychiatrists share the same surname).  On January 30, 2008, prosecution and defense presented their summation to the court and Justice Grant reserved decision until March 5, 2008.  In [[Canadian criminal law]], while the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] which must be met to find the accused guilty of a crime is that of &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;, the burden of proof for the defense of non-criminal responsibility based on mental condition is the lower standard of a &quot;balance of probabilities&quot;.

== Court's decision ==

On March 5, 2008, Justice William Grant found Gregory Despres guilty of causing the deaths of Fred Fulton and Verna Decarie in 2005. However, Justice Grant agreed with the defense in finding that Despres was not criminally responsible for his actions at the time. Despres is currently being held at Shepody Healing Centre which is part of the Dorchester Penitentiary.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Powell was raised in [[Michigan]] by a dysfunctional family.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; His father was a musician who was often absent during his childhood, leaving Powell to take care of his three younger siblings.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; At age 15, Powell ran away from his home and hitchhiked to [[Florida]], where he met a [[Catholic priest]] and together they had a brief sexual relationship.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EZjlE4-1GSIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49 |last= Newton |first= Michael |title= The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings |year= 2002 |location= |publisher= Infobase Publishing |isbn=9781438129884 |via= Google Books}} page 49&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, he stole money and a car from his sister; he stole another car when he was 18.&lt;ref name=two&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IYqA3J9kSt8C&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85 |last2= Keyes |first2= Gary |last1= Lawler |first1= Mike |title= Murder &amp; Mayhem in the Crescenta Valley |year= 2013 |location= |publisher= The History Press |isbn= 9781609499976 |via= Google Books}} page 85&lt;/ref&gt; Powell served time in Michigan for car theft.&lt;ref name=newton/&gt; When he was 20, Powell was released from prison.&lt;ref name=two/&gt; At one point in his life, after he and his family moved to [[California]], Powell underwent either a [[craniectomy]] or a [[craniotomy]] at Vacaville Medical Facility to remove a [[brain tumor]].&lt;ref name=newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=two/&gt; Powell was frequently in and out of prison; by the time he was 29 years old, ten of the last thirteen years of his life were spent behind bars.&lt;ref name=two/&gt; He was officially paroled in May 1962.&lt;ref name=newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=two/&gt; Powell worked as thief and had often robbed liquor stores.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |last= Yardley |first= William |title= Gregory Powell, 'The Onion Field&quot; Killer, Dies at 79 |date= August 13, 2012 |work= [[The New York Times]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/us/gregory-powell-the-onion-field-killer-dies-at-79.html |access-date= November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as a gay hustler.&lt;ref name=newton/&gt; As of January 1963, Powell had been responsible for a series of armed robberies in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=newton/&gt; At the time of the kidnapping, Powell was residing in [[Boulder City, Nevada]].&lt;ref name=newspaper&gt;{{cite news |title= One of 2 Abducted Police Officers Is Shot to Death |date= March 11, 1963 |work= [[The Spokesman-Review]] |location= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19630311&amp;id=VzlWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yegDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5892,3583354&amp;hl=en |access-date= November 27, 2015 |via= Google News}}{{page needed |date= November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oregon&gt;{{cite news |title= Kidnapers of Two Policemen Accuse Each Other of Slaying |date= March 10, 1963 |work= [[Eugene Register-Guard]] |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19630310&amp;id=fhlWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D-MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6099,1939568&amp;hl=en |access-date= November 27, 2015 |via= Google News}}{{page needed |date= November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregory Scarpa, Sr.''' (May 8, 1928 &amp;ndash; June 4, 1994) nicknamed '''The Grim Reaper''' and also '''The Mad Hatter''', was an American [[Caporegime|capo]] and [[hitman]] for the [[Colombo crime family]] and an informant for the [[FBI]].  During the 1970s and 80s, Scarpa was the chief enforcer and a veteran [[hitman]] for Colombo boss [[Carmine Persico]]. Scarpa was responsible for committing three murders in 1991 and is suspected to have committed a minimum of 80 murders from the early 1950s through 1992. Scarpa is believed by the [[FBI]] to have murdered 100 to 120 people.

==Biography==
Scarpa was born to first-generation immigrants, Salvatore and Mary, from the impoverished village of Lorenzaga of [[Motta di Livenza]] near [[Venice]], [[Italy]]. Scarpa was the older brother of Colombo mobster Salvatore Scarpa, who may have introduced Scarpa to the Colombo family. &lt;ref name=mafia1&gt;{{cite web|title=GREG SCARPA SNR. Part 1|url=http://realdealmafia.com/scarpa.html|work=Mafia-International.com|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1950s, Scarpa married Connie Forrest; she and Scarpa had one daughter and three sons, including Gregory Scarpa Jr. Greg Jr., who would follow his father into the Colombo family, eventually becoming a capo. Scarpa and Forrest separated in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gman&quot;/&gt;  Scarpa also maintained a 30-year relationship with girlfriend Linda Schiro that resulted in two children, Joseph and Linda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcbstv.com/local/schiro.trial.blog.2.458343.html &quot;Squeeze Puts Squeeze On G-Man&quot;] by Pablo Guzman WCBS&lt;/ref&gt; Scarpa reportedly joined the Colombo family during the 1950s. 

Scarpa was a stylish dresser who routinely carried $5,000 in [[wikt:pocket money|pocket money]] for purchases and bribes. Scarpa had use of an apartment on Manhattan's [[Sutton Place, Manhattan|Sutton Place]] and owned homes in [[Singer Island, Florida]], [[Staten Island]], [[Brooklyn]] and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. His power, guile and brutality earned him the nickname &quot;[[the Grim Reaper]]&quot; and helped him escape prosecution for many years. Schiro later said that Scarpa would sometimes leave the numbers &quot;666&quot;, the biblical [[Number of the Beast]], on his victims' [[pager]]s.&lt;ref name=Schiro&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunleavy|first=Steve|title=I LOVED A 'CUTE' KILLER MOLL TELLS OF BRUTAL SCARPA'S 'SENSITIVE' SIDE|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/loved_cute_killer_ihh3acPlYx2lPXzbQtWiGO|accessdate=19 October 2011|newspaper=New York Post|date=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A career criminal, Scarpa eventually became a [[caporegime]] in the Colombo crime family, as well as the proprietor of the Wimpy Boys Social Club. Scarpa was involved in [[illegal gambling]], [[loansharking]], [[extortion]], [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]], counterfeit credit cards, assault, stock and bond thefts, narcotics and murder.

===Mississippi civil rights workers===
{{main|Mississippi civil rights worker murders}}
In the summer of 1964, according to Schiro and other sources, FBI field agents in [[Mississippi]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mob moll says Mafiosi helped FBI |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071029/ap_on_re_us/mob_fbi_agent|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101052123/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071029/ap_on_re_us/mob_fbi_agent|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|date=October 29, 2007|archivedate=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; recruited Scarpa to come to Mississippi to help them find missing civil rights workers [[Andrew Goodman]], [[James Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner]]. The FBI was convinced the three men had been murdered, but could not find their bodies. The agents thought that Scarpa, using illegal interrogation techniques not available to agents, might succeed at gaining this information from suspects. Once Scarpa arrived in Mississippi, local FBI agents allegedly provided him with a gun and money to pay for information. Scarpa and an FBI agent allegedly [[Pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] and kidnapped [[Lawrence Byrd]], a TV salesman and secret [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]], from his store in [[Laurel, Mississippi|Laurel]] and took him to [[Camp Shelby]], a local Army base. At Shelby, Scarpa severely beat Byrd and stuck a gun barrel down his throat. The terrified Byrd finally revealed to Scarpa the location of the civil rights workers' bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3792328&amp;page=1 &quot;Mob Solved 'Mississippi Burning' Murders?&quot;] ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; 

The FBI has never officially confirmed the Scarpa story. In addition, the story contradicts evidence from investigative journalist [[Jerry Mitchell (investigative reporter)|Jerry Mitchell]] and Illinois high school teacher Barry Bradford, who claimed that Mississippi [[Mississippi Highway Patrol|highway patrolman]] Maynard King provided the grave locations to FBI agent [[Joseph Sullivan (FBI)|Joseph Sullivan]] after obtaining the information from an anonymous third party.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In January 1966, Scarpa allegedly helped the FBI a second time in Mississippi on the murder case of [[Vernon Dahmer]], killed in a fire set by the Klan. After this second trip, Scarpa and the FBI had a sharp disagreement about his reward for these services. The FBI then dropped Scarpa as a confidential informant. &lt;ref name=mafia2&gt;{{cite web|title=GREG SCARPA SNR. Part Two|url=http://realdealmafia.com/scarpa2.html|work=Mafia-International.com|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FBI informant===
In 1980, FBI agent [[Lindley DeVecchio]] became Scarpa's contact and handler, and restarted his relationship with the FBI. Scarpa had refused contact with the FBI for the previous five years, but DeVecchio persuaded him to cooperate again. Gregory Jr., Linda Schiro, and federal prosecutors later claimed that Scarpa had numerous illegal dealings with DeVecchio. Scarpa allegedly provided DeVecchio with cash, jewelry and other gifts along with information of questionable value on the Colombos. In return, DeVecchio allegedly protected Scarpa from arrest and provided him with information about his enemies during the Third Colombo war.&lt;ref name=&quot;mob war&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=de Szigethy|first=J.R|title=MOB WAR! Part II Anatomy of a Frame-up|work=AmericanMafia.com|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years, the FBI reportedly paid Scarpa $158,000 for his services. According to mob associates, Scarpa would joke about &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, a female friend in law enforcement who gave him information. For ten years, DeVecchio met alone with Scarpa, often at an apartment or hotel room provided by the FBI.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gman&quot;/&gt; DeVecchio was a frequent dinner guest at Scarpa's house and on one occasion received a hard-to-find [[Cabbage Patch doll]] from Scarpa as a gift. Some of DeVecchio's fellow agents were disturbed by DeVecchio's closeness to Scarpa, and were soon reporting it to their FBI superiors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y-ICAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=Scarpa+Mississippi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X-SINhl5kd&amp;sig=z14bTZP1Tmx9Kfc7bHrvn-jbBSs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fNOsTN6RJoLknAfPtuDhDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Scarpa%20Mississippi&amp;f=false &quot;Who Handled Who&quot;] by John Connolly New York Magazine December 2, 1996 (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, federal prosecutors indicted Scarpa for running a major [[credit card]] scam. After Scarpa pleaded guilty, prosecutors asked the court to give him a sizable fine and a prison sentence. However, DeVecchio submitted a memo to the judge that listed all of Scarpa's contributions to the FBI. The judge finally sentenced Scarpa to five years [[probation]] with no prison time and a $10,000 fine. Colombo family members were so surprised by Scarpa's light sentence that some started wondering if he was working for the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uQ6HaTCDOoAC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=scarpa+Sr.+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fpw_HXXJpg&amp;sig=rEcZbIIaAghmnR9l9ZLKBM9IYWY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0RCuTOnTN4H6lwfSw4GRAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=scarpa%20Sr.%201985&amp;f=false &quot;Mafia Son: The Scarpa Mob Family, the FBI, and a Story of Betrayal&quot;] By Sandra Harmon pp. 115–116 (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV Infection===
In 1986, Scarpa was diagnosed with [[HIV]]. After having emergency [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]] surgery at Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn in 1986, Scarpa received several [[blood donation]]s from family members and associates. Scarpa had refused blood from the hospital [[blood bank]] because he feared that the blood might have come from [[African-American]]s, whom he despised.&lt;ref name=mafia3&gt;{{cite web|title=GREG SCARPA SNR. Part Three|url=http://realdealmafia.com/scarpa3.html|work=Mafia-International.com|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scarpa eventually got blood from mobster Paul Mele, a [[body builder]] who was abusing [[steroids]]. Mele had contracted [[HIV]] from a dirty needle and transmitted it to Scarpa in the [[blood transfusion]]. 

Surgeons at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in Manhattan eventually removed Scarpa's stomach. On August 30, 1992, Scarpa received a $300,000 settlement in civil court from his first surgeon and Victory Hospital for [[negligence]].&lt;ref name=settlement&gt;{{cite news|last=Tabor|first=Mary B. W.|title=Settlement in Lawsuit on H.I.V.-Tainted Blood|accessdate=25 November 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 30, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Scarpa's illness progressed to [[AIDS]], he and his relatives told everyone that he was suffering from [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gman&quot;/&gt;

===Assassination attempt and retaliation===
In 1991, supporters of Colombo rebel [[Victor Orena]] attempted to kill Scarpa. Earlier in 1991, a struggle between imprisoned Colombo boss [[Carmine Persico]] and acting boss [[Victor Orena]] broke into violence. Persico's loyalists had unsuccessfully attempted to kill Orena at his Brooklyn home. In retaliation, Orena decided to murder Scarpa, one of Persico's strongest supporters. On November 18, 1991, Scarpa was driving his own vehicle followed behind by his daughter and grandson in Brooklyn when he was stopped by two cars. [[Hitmen]] ran from their vehicles with guns drawn and converged on Scarpa's car. But Scarpa managed to drive away from the ambush, crashing into anything that got in his way. A few bystanders were injured, but Scarpa and his relatives escaped unharmed.&lt;ref name=junion&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Colombo Family: Junior's WAr|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/colombo/7.html|work=TruTV Crime Library|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the seven-month conflict between Persico and Orena, Scarpa served as Persico's military commander. Although weakened by illness, Scarpa constantly cruised along Avenue U in Brooklyn, looking for Orena supporters in social clubs and bars. Incensed by the murder attempt with his family, Scarpa was especially watchful for Orena loyalist [[William Cutolo]], who had organized it.&lt;ref name=mafia3 /&gt; Over the next few weeks, Scarpa and his associates killed Genovese crime family mobster [[Thomas Amato]] (a mistake) and Orena loyalists [[Rosario Nastasa]], [[Vincent Fusaro]], and [[James Malpiso]]. Scarpa allegedly shot Fursaro as he was hanging Christmas lights on his house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gman&quot;&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1996/12/16/1996_12_16_068_TNY_CARDS_000377271#ixzz11hUOGYMy &quot;The G-man and the Hit Man&quot;] by Fredric Danne ''New Yorker Magazine'' December 16, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mafia3 /&gt;

===Prison and death===
In 1992, Scarpa's AIDS lawsuit was settled with $300,000 in cash payments to his family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDC1731F933A0575BC0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= &quot;Settlement in Lawsuit on H.I.V.-Tainted Blood&quot;] Mary B.W. Tabor New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, while appearing at a New York civil courtroom for his medical lawsuit, Scarpa was arrested for violating state firearms laws. Soon after, Scarpa was indicted on federal racketeering charges involving three murders. 

On December 29, 1992, while under [[house arrest]] with an [[electronic monitoring]] device, Scarpa lost an eye in a shootout with other mobsters. Two [[Lucchese crime family]] mobsters, [[Michael DeRosa]] and [[Ronald Moran]], had threatened Joey Scarpa, Gregory's son, over a drug deal. Climbing out of bed, Gregory Scarpa drove with Joey to DeRosa's house and shot DeRosa twice. Moran fired back and hit Scarpa in the eye. Back at his house, Scarpa allegedly poured some [[Scotch Whisky]] into his wound, assured the authorities everything was fine, and later went to the hospital. Prosecutors revoked Scarpa's house arrest and sent him to jail.&lt;ref name=mafia4 /&gt; 

By 1993, Scarpa was blind in one eye, [[Emaciation|emaciated]] and in poor health. On May 6, 1993, Scarpa pleaded guilty to three murders and conspiracy to murder several others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/0509/chapter3.htm &quot;Special Report: Chapter Three: The Attorney General's Guidelines Regarding the Use of Confidential Informants&quot;] Office of the Inspector General U.S. Department of Justice September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, 1993, Scarpa was sentenced to life in federal prison. This sentence was later reduced to ten years due to Scarpa's poor health&lt;ref name=mafia4&gt;{{cite web|title=GREG SCARPA SNR. Part 4|url=http://realdealmafia.com/scarpa4.html|work=Mafia-International.com|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 1994, Gregory Scarpa Sr. died in the [[Federal Medical Center, Rochester|Federal Medical Center]] (FMC) for prisoners in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] from [[AIDS]]-related complications.&lt;ref name=&quot;scarpa obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gregory Scarpa, Sr.|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/434/000024362/|work=NNDB|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Scarpa's status as an informer was only revealed in 1995, during a racketeering and murder trial of seven members of the Orena faction.  At that time, former Colombo family [[consigliere]] [[Carmine Sessa]], now a government witness, told prosecutors about DeVecchio's unusual and corrupt relationship with Scarpa.&lt;ref name=canary&gt;{{cite news|last=FRANCESCANI|first=CHRISTOPHER|title=MURDEROUS MOB CANARY SPRUNG|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/murderous_mob_canary_sprung_6jUvw4SDKcImtpGIiKDZiO|accessdate=3 October 2011|newspaper=New York Post|date=September 29, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, prosecutors were forced to reveal that DeVecchio might have revealed confidential information, including information about former Colombo wiseguys who had turned informer, to Scarpa.  Ultimately, 19 Orena supporters had murder charges thrown out or murder convictions reversed after their attorneys contended DeVecchio's collaboration with Scarpa tainted the evidence against them.  The attorneys argued that DeVecchio gave Scarpa information he used to kill members of the Orena faction, thus making any killings committed by their clients acts of self-defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raab&quot;&gt;Raab, Selwyn. ''The Five Families: The Rise, Decline &amp; Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empire''. New York: St. Martins Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2006, DeVecchio, who was forced to retire from the FBI in 1996, was indicted on charges of complicity with Scarpa and other Colombo mobsters in four murders during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/nyregion/31mobcnd.html?scp=34&amp;sq=%22Gregory%20Scarpa%20Sr%22&amp;st=cse &quot;Ex-F.B.I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2341">'''Gregory Scott Johnson''' (February 18, 1965 &amp;ndash; May 25, 2005 at the [[List of Indiana state prisons|Indiana State Prison]] in [[Michigan City, Indiana]]) was [[Execution (legal)|legally executed]] for beating and stomping 82-year-old Ruby Hutslar to death in [[Anderson, Indiana]] on June 23, 1985. He then [[arson|set her house on fire]] in an attempt to conceal his crime.

Johnson sought a [[Pardon#Related concepts|reprieve]], asserting that he wanted to [[Organ donation|donate]] a portion of his [[liver]] to his ailing sister, 48-year-old Deborah Otis, who was suffering from non-alcoholic [[cirrhosis]] of the liver and was in need of a [[liver transplantation|transplant]].  His reprieve was denied because most doctors believe that it is [[Ethics|unethical]] to [[harvest organs]] after death by [[lethal injection]], and because Johnson was not a suitable donor himself. Another possibility&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; though not in [[Indiana]], where all organ recipients (except [[kidney]] recipients) are chosen by state law according to their places on a waiting list, on which list Johnson's sister herself did not appear&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; would have been a living partial organ donation prior to execution. The case for delaying execution probably was not helped by the fact that Johnson was infected with [[Hepatitis B]] himself, and that his liver was too large to be suitable for his sister. Patients in Indiana generally receive a liver after at least twenty days on a waiting list.

In a statement before his death, Johnson criticized the [[Parole Board]] for declining his request.

Her rank at the camp was ''Arbeitseinsatzführerin'' (Work Input Overseer).

[[Image:Kotoshikhin autograph.gif|frame|right|Manuscript of Kotoshikhin's book]]
'''Grigory Karpovich Kotoshikhin''' (''Григорий Карпович Котошихин'' in Russian) ([[Circa|c.]] 1630 – November 1667) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] diplomat, [[podyachy]] of the [[Posolsky Prikaz]], and writer.

In 1658–61, Grigory Kotoshikhin was one of those sent on a [[diplomatic mission]] to negotiate the [[Treaty of Valiesar]] and [[Treaty of Kardis]] with [[Sweden]]. In the spring of 1664, he was dispatched to see Prince [[Yakov Cherkassky]] and take charge of his army's clerical work. In August, however, Grigory Kotoshikhin [[Defector|defected]] to the [[Lithuanians]] and moved to [[Silesia]]. After that, he went to [[Stockholm]] via [[Narva]] and was admitted to the Swedish service. Kotoshikhin converted from Orthodoxy to Lutheran Protestantism and adopted the name Ivan-Alexander Selitsky. In the fall of 1667, he was executed at [[Stockholm]] for killing, while drunk, the owner of the house where he had been living. 

Grigory Kotoshikhin authored a work called ''On Russia during the Reign of [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexey Mikhailovich]]'' (first published in 1840), which represents a valuable source of history of the mid-17th century [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Kotoshikhin's historical account is quite detailed and correct, and most of the information in his book is confirmed by other sources of the 17th century. One has to consider the fact, however, that Kotoshikhin wrote his work at the request of the Swedish government and that some of his opinions on Russian 17th-century realities are [[bias]]ed.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Petrovsky was born in a village of [[Pechenihy Raion|Pechenihy]] in [[Kharkov Governorate]] on 3 February (Old Style - 22 January) 1878, in the family of a craftsman (some sources claim - son of tailor and laundrywoman). Grigory's father died when he was three. Petrovsky had two siblings.

After finishing two classes of school at the Kharkiv Theological Seminary in 1889, Petrovsky was dismissed for not being able to pay for his tuition. Being 11 years old he left education for a job in the city working for a [[locomotive depot]]. In 1893 at age of 15 he arrived to Yekaterinoslav ([[Dnipropetrovsk]]) where he found a job at the Bryansk Metallurgical Factory (today - Petrovsky Factory).

In 1895 Petrovsky joined the revolutionary movement and in 1897 enrolled in the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDRP) and joined the &quot;Union in the fight for the liberation of the worker's class&quot; as well as the Yekaterinslav committee of RSDRP. At this period of time he actively participated in the political agitation for the [[Bolsheviks]] from [[Mykolaiv]] to [[Mariupol]], from [[Donets basin]] to Kharkiv, for which he was arrested in 1900 and 1903.

During the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1905]] Petrovsky became one of the organizers and leaders of the Yekaterinoslav City Council of Worker's Deputies and the local Battle Strike Committee. However, he soon was forced to flee and for a brief period of time emigrated to [[Germany]]. In 1907 he returned to [[Mariupol]] where he worked as a [[turning]] specialist and continued his revolutionary activity at the factory &quot;Russian Providence&quot; (today - part of [[Ilyich Steel &amp; Iron Works]]).

===Parliament and revolution===
In 1912 Petrovsky was elected a deputy to the Russian 4th [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|State Duma]] as a representative of workers of the [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] for [[Bolshevik]] faction. During this time he also was a chief editor of ''[[Pravda]]''. In January 1913 Petrovsky was included into the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of RSDRP]]. It is known that in the Duma he spoke on 32 occasions, while the text of his 21st speech was prepared personally by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In his speeches Petrovsky was addressing the issues related to improving working conditions and life of miners and workers of [[Donets basin]].

With the start of [[World War I]] in November 1914 he was arrested along with the other six Bolshevik members of the parliament and in February 1915 was sentenced to a lifetime exile in [[Turukhansky Krai]] (today - the northern part of [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]]).

After the Bolshevik seizure of power Petrovsky was appointed People's Commissar for the Interior Affairs between 30 November 1917 and 1 March 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elisanet.fi/daglarsson/dokumentit/sov.htm#LENIN|title=Government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic 1917-1923: Lenin|work=elisanet.fi/daglarsson|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716153010/http://www.elisanet.fi/daglarsson/dokumentit/sov.htm#LENIN|archivedate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this post he oversaw the activities of the [[Cheka]] and was one of the advocates of the [[Red Terror]], he wrote in his order &quot;A huge number of hostages has to be taken to the bourgeoisie, in cases of resistance these hostages have to be shot in masses(....) No hesitation in the application of the terror&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Baynac, La terreur sous Lénine, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Russian delegation during signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in 1917.

On 30 December 1922 he became the representative of [[Ukraine SSR]] in the [[USSR Central Executive Committee]] after signing the decree for the creation of the [[Soviet Union]]. According to the [[BBC]], &quot;Petrovsky saw himself as an internationalist, and rejected [[Ukrainian nationalism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=BBCNews/&gt; He was co-chairman of the USSR Central Executive Committee until 12 January 1938, when he was elected deputy chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]].

===Survivor of the Great Terror===
He was not purged during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], but he was shocked and saddened by the executions of close friends such as [[Stanislav Kosior]], [[Vlas Chubar]] and [[Sukhomlin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medvedev1971&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Aleksandrovich Medvedev|title=Let history judge: the origins and consequences of Stalinism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol1pAAAAMAAJ|year=1971|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-394-44645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the USSR celebrated its sixteenth birthday, he was interrogated by [[Joseph Stalin]], who told him, &quot;We shoot people like you but you will be spared&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Medvedev1971&quot;/&gt; and then was excluded from the Communist Party and deprived of his [[dacha]]s and apartments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medvedev1971&quot;/&gt; After a year without a job, in 1940 he was made the director of the [[Revolution Museum of the USSR]] in [[Moscow]] and never returned to politics. During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]], after the death of his son Leonid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steen Ammentorp|url=http://www.generals.dk/general/Petrovskii/Leonid_Grigorevich/Soviet_Union.html|title=Biography of Lieutenant-General Leonid Grigorevich Petrovskii - Soviet Union|publisher=generals.dk|date=|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he asked Stalin in a letter to release his imprisoned son Peter, but he was subsequently shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medvedev1971&quot;/&gt; Petrovsky died in 1958.

Petrovsky's body is interred near the [[Kremlin wall]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name=BBCNews&gt;{{cite news|author=Rostyslav Khotin|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8380433.stm|title=Ukraine tears down controversial statue|agency=[[BBC News]]|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The city [[Dnipropetrovsk]] (originally named Yekaterinoslav) was named after Petrovsky from 1926 until 2016.&lt;ref name=BBCNews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Kern|title=The Kravchenko Case: One Man's War on Stalin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leloAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=27 February 2016|year=2007|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=978-1-929631-73-5|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2016 the city was renamed &quot;Dnipro&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uatoday.tv/society/dnipropetrovsk-renamed-as-dnipro-651161.html|title=UNIAN News. Latest news of Ukraine and world|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Ukrainians]] believed that the city should have been renamed after Ukraine gained independence in 1991.&lt;ref name=BBCNews/&gt; The city was eventually renamed to comply with  [[decommunization in Ukraine|2015 decommunization laws]].&lt;ref name=decommupbbcU&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/05/15/7068057/ Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization].

A statue of Petrovsky in [[Kiev]] (the capital of [[Ukraine]]) was demolished in late November 2009, just days before the annual Ukrainian commemorating of the victims of the [[Holodomor]]. [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] had issued a decree ordering the removal of monuments to Soviet leaders, &quot;in memory of the victims of the Holodomor&quot;. Ukrainian historians' consensus considers Petrovsky one of the main executors of Stalin's policies in Ukraine. Other historians, like [[Vasyl Marochko]], a member of an official commission that investigated the Holodomor, say that when Petrovsky realised the extent of the famine, he pleaded twice with Stalin to provide Ukrainians with more food but this request went unheeded.&lt;ref name=BBCNews/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4470">'''Grigory Leontyevich Valuyev''', also spelt as '''Voluyev''' ({{lang-ru|Григорий Леонтьевич Валуев}}) (? – after 1623), was a [[Russia]]n [[voyevoda]], the older of the two sons of [[Leontiy Valuyev]].

==Life==
Grigory Valuyev (together with [[Ivan Voyeykov]]) made himself a name in May 1606 by fatally shooting [[False Dmitry I]] (according to other accounts, it was a Muscovite merchant by the name of Mylnik or Mylnikov who had made the fatal shot). Thus, Voluyev’s participation in the impostor’s assassination brought him closer to the court of [[Vasili IV of Russia]]. Grigory Valuyev was often used as a voyevoda/messenger between the tsar and his cousin [[Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky]] during the latter’s [[De la Gardie Campaign|trip to Novgorod]] in 1609. At the order of Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky, Grigory Valuyev (together with [[Semyon Golovin]], Prince [[Yakov Baryatinsky]], and [[David Zherebtsov]]) had to prevent the [[Lithuania]]n forces from crossing the [[Zhabyn River]]. On September 1, 1609, Valuyev, Golovin, and a Swedish commander [[Krister Somme|marshal Kristiern Somme]] occupied [[Pereyaslavl-Zalessky]] and then forced the Polish army out of [[Alexandrov (town)|Alexandrovskaya Sloboda]]. 

On January 9, 1610, Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky sent Grigory Valuyev with 500 soldiers to assist in relieving the [[Siege of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]], laid by Polish commanders [[Jan Piotr Sapieha]] and [[Aleksander Józef Lisowski]]. After Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky’s sudden death in April 1610, Valuyev was transferred under the command of [[Dmitry Shuisky]] and sent to defend the western borders from the army of [[Hetman]] [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]]. On May 11, 1610, Grigory Valuyev together with Swedish commanders [[Jacob De la Gardie]] and [[Evert Horn]] expelled the Polish army from [[Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery]] and rescued [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|Metropolitan Filaret of Rostov]] from [[Roman Ruzhinsky]] (commander of [[False Dmitry II]]’s army in [[Tushino]]). After that, Valuyev and Prince [[Fyodor Yeletsky]] were put in charge of a unit stationed in a village of [[Tsaryovo-Zaymishche]] and responsible for providing cover for the army of Dmitry Shuisky (located near [[Mozhaysk]]). Stanisław Żółkiewski [[siege of Tsaryovo-Zaymishche|besieged Tsaryovo-Zaymishche]] and then led the rest of his army towards Mozhaysk, defeating the Russians at the [[Battle of Klushino]]. The hetman then returned to Tsaryovo-Zaymishche and offered the besieged to surrender. 

Grigory Valuyev and Fyodor Yeletsky decided to capitulate and swore allegiance to [[Władysław IV Vasa]] on the conditions specified earlier by a Russian voyevoda and statesman [[Mikhail Glebovich Saltykov]] during his negotiations with [[Sigismund III Vasa]] (those conditions were as follows: 1) release of all Russian prisoners, 2) in case Władysław takes control over [[Smolensk]], Sigismund must abandon the city without causing any destruction or violence, 3) there will be no [[Catholicism]] in Russia). Valuyev, Yeletsky and their men joined the Polish army and headed towards Moscow, asking the Muscovites in a written message to swear allegiance to the new Russian tsar Władysław. As the ensuing developments illustrated, the Poles had no intention to fulfill these conditions. 

After the enthronement of [[Mikhail Romanov]] in the summer of 1613, Grigory Valuyev showed himself as his zealous servant. In 1614, he was ordered to remain in Moscow to defend the city against a possible attack by the [[Nogai Horde]]. In 1615, Valuyev served as voyevoda in [[Vologda]] and was sent back to Moscow that same year. In 1617, he and a boyar named [[Boris Lykov-Obolensky]] were dispatched to Mozhaysk to defend the city against Władysław’s army. In 1618, Valuyev participated in the defense of Moscow against Władysław’s army. In 1619-1620, he was a voyevoda in [[Yelets]]. In 1621, Valuyev was sent as a second voyevoda to [[Vyazma]] to join Prince [[Alexei Sitsky]]. In 1623, he was dispatched to [[Astrakhan]] to serve together with Prince [[Ivan Fyodorovich Khovansky]]. Grigory Valuyev was married to a certain Ulyana Stepanovna, from whom he had the only son named Ivan.

==Personal life==
Franklin was born on August 30, 1952. He grew up in [[South Central Los Angeles]]. He married and had two children. He was given a [[general discharge]] from the [[United States Army]] on July 24, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Pelisek |first= Christine |title=Accused Grim Sleeper Lonnie Franklin Jr. Is the Ringmaster of His Own Murder Trial |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/accused-grim-sleeper-lonnie-franklin-jr-is-the-ringmaster-of-his-own-murder-trial-4504291 |publisher=LA Weekly |date= 14 March 2014 |accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;url= http://www.people.com/article/grim-sleeper-serial-killer-lonnie-franklin-sentenced&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

In the 1980s, following the deaths of several women in [[south Los Angeles, California]], community members formed the &quot;Black Women Count&quot; movement. The group pressured police into setting up a task force and into acknowledging the deaths as serial killings. The coalition launched a media campaign and set a monetary reward aiming to capture the killer. The joint [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]-[[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] investigation determined that the crimes were committed by a single person labeled the &quot;Southside Slayer&quot;. Their results were announced to the public on September 23, 1985.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

According to investigators, evidence was found suggesting that several serial killers were murdering women in south Los Angeles. Louis Craine committed at least two of the &quot;Southside Slayer&quot; murders, and [[Michael Hughes (serial killer)|Michael Hughes]], [[Daniel Lee Siebert]], [[Chester Turner]], and Ivan Hill at least one each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Map: Serial Killers in South L.A. |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 3 August 2010 |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-serialkillersmap-0804-i,0,515310.htmlstory |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate series of killings commenced with the murder of Debra Jackson and a different [[modus operandi|MO]] involving a firearm.&lt;ref name=SSS&gt;{{cite web |last= Jones |first= Jack |title= Man Sought in Slayings of 10 L.A.-Area Prostitutes |work= Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date= 24 September 1985 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-24/news/mn-18536_1 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These became known, misleadingly, as the &quot;Strawberry Murders.&quot; Sheriff's Detective Rickey Ross was wrongfully arrested due to a ballistics error. Two decades later, the perpetrator of these crimes was dubbed the &quot;Grim Sleeper&quot; due to the long period of apparent inactivity between murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jill Stewart |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2010-07-15/news/missing-the-grim-sleeper-by-a-hair/1 |title=Missing the Grim Sleeper by a Hair|work=LA Weekly |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the slaying of Janecia Peters, 25, was linked through [[DNA]] analysis to at least 11 unsolved murders in Los Angeles, the first of which occurred in 1985. This same year, in secrecy, the LAPD formed the &quot;800 Task Force,&quot; composed of six detectives and overseen by the Robbery-Homicide Unit. After a four-month investigation, the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' [[investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] Christine Pelisek broke the news of the task force's existence, the linkage of Peters' killing to the earlier murders, and the silence of Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] and Police Chief [[William J. Bratton]] regarding the killer's existence. The mayor and police chief neither issued a press release nor warned the community. In some cases, ''LA Weekly'' was the first to inform the families that their daughters had long been confirmed as victims of a serial killer.&lt;ref name=LAWeekly0/&gt;

In early September 2008, Los Angeles officials announced that they were offering a $500,000 reward to help catch the killer.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; On November 1, the case was featured on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] program ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=60381/ |title=Most Wanted fugitives website (defunct) |date= |work=[[America's Most Wanted]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022040939/http://www.amw.com/ |archivedate=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2009, Police Chief Bratton addressed the press for the first time regarding the case, at which time the police formally gave the killer the &quot;Grim Sleeper&quot; nickname chosen by ''L.A. Weekly''. Bratton also released a 911 call from the 1980s in which a man reported seeing a body being dumped by the Grim Sleeper, giving a detailed description and license plate number of a van connected with the now-closed Cosmopolitan Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pelisek |first=Christine |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/1tape-may-hold-clue-to-identif/ |title=Tape May Hold Clue to Identifying Grim Sleeper Serial Killer – Los Angeles News – The Informer |publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, reporter Pelisek did an extensive interview with Enietra Washington, the sole survivor of the Grim Sleeper's attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-08-28/news/grim-sleeper/4 |title=Grim Sleeper Returns: He's Murdering Angelenos, as Cops Hunt his DNA|work=LA Weekly |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAWeekly1&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-03-12/news/grim-sleeper-39-s-sole-survivor/2 |title=Grim Sleeper's Sole Survivor|work=LA Weekly |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described him as &quot;a black man in his early 30s...He looked neat. Tidy. Kind of geeky. He wore a black polo shirt tucked into khaki trousers.&quot; She also described the interior and exterior of his vehicle.&lt;ref name=survive&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-03-12/news/grim-sleeper-39-s-sole-survivor/ |title=Grim Sleeper's Sole Survivor|work=LA Weekly |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On July 7, 2010, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that an arrest had been made. District Attorney Steve Cooley identified the suspect as 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. (born August 30, 1952), a mechanic who worked between 1981 and 1988 for the City of Los Angeles in the sanitation department and briefly for the police department.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; Franklin was identified for arrest, at least in part, on [[DNA profiling#DNA evidence as evidence in criminal trials|familial DNA analysis]].&lt;ref name=latimesblog&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/07/lapd-make-arrest-in-grim-sleeper-serial-killings.html |title=LAPD make arrest in Grim Sleeper serial killings |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date= 2010-07-07|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police had found no exact match between DNA found at the crime scenes and any of the profiles in California's DNA profile database, so they searched the database for stored profiles that demonstrated sufficient similarity to allow police to infer a familial relationship. They found similar DNA belonging to Franklin's son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a felony weapons charge. According to [[Los Angeles County District Attorney|Los Angeles District Attorney]] Steve Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin's DNA to make the link. One Los Angeles undercover police officer pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant where the suspect ate. He collected dishes, silverware, glasses, and pizza crusts to obtain DNA.&lt;ref name=yahoonews1/&gt; The identification was used to arrest Franklin after his DNA was obtained and deemed a match.&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt; Saliva found on the victims established a DNA match linking Franklin to the deaths.&lt;ref name=abcnews1/&gt;

Law enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his [[DNA]] was never collected. In 2003, he was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised probation. In 2004, voters passed [[California Proposition 69 (2004)|Proposition 69]], which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the [[DNA database]]. In July 2005, Franklin was on unsupervised probation, but his DNA was not entered into the system. Probation officers did not collect DNA samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. During that period, the probation department did not have the resources to collect samples. Officers did not collect samples until August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-dna-20100715|title=Authorities Missed A Chance to Catch Grim Sleeper Suspect|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2010-07-23|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin has a criminal record dating back to 1989. He was convicted of two charges of stolen property, one charge of misdemeanor assault, and one charge of battery. He served time for one of the charges of stolen property.&lt;ref name=abcnews1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/familys-dna-led-police-grim-sleeper-serial-killer/story?id=11116381&amp;page=2|title=New Technique of Using Family's DNA Led Police to 'Grim Sleeper' Suspect|publisher=ABC News|date=2010-07-08|accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with ten murders and one [[attempted murder]].

News|date=2010-07-09|accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2010, the Los Angeles Police Department released 180 photos of women found in Franklin's home. Police officials released the images after unsuccessful attempts to identify the individuals, possibly additional victims. &quot;These people are not suspects, we don't even know if they are victims, but we do know this: Lonnie Franklin's reign of terror in the city of Los Angeles, which spanned well over two decades, culminating with almost a dozen murder victims, certainly needs to be investigated further,&quot; said Chief [[Charlie Beck]] of the LAPD. In all, investigators found over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video in his home.&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitcomb |first=Dan |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BF6EU20101216 |title=L.A. police release photos of possible Grim Sleeper victims |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The images show mainly black women of a wide age range, from teenagers to middle-aged and older, often nude. Police believe Franklin took many of the pictures, which show both conscious and unconscious individuals, dating back 30 years.&lt;ref name=reuters1/&gt; The photos were released to the public in an effort to identify the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayes |first=Kevin |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20026038-504083.html |title=&quot;Grim Sleeper&quot; Photos: LAPD Deluged with Calls - Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/grim-sleeper-serial-killer-victim-photos-released-los/story?id=12424559 |title=Five Women Tentatively Identified in 'Grim Sleeper' Cas - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2011, Reuters reported that the police were considering Lonnie David Franklin as a suspect in six more slayings of additional female victims. The police were investigating two of the six as potential victims killed during a 14-year lapse between an initial spate of &quot;Grim Sleeper&quot; murders that ended in 1988 and several more that began in 2002. Of the remaining four victims, two bodies were discovered in the 1980s and two were reported missing in 2005 but the remains of the other two were never found, police said. Detectives said they linked Franklin to the six additional killings after reviewing hundreds of old case files and seeking the public's help in identifying a collection of 180 photographs of women and girls that were found in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Kandel |first= Jason |title= Police tie &quot;Grim Sleeper&quot; suspect to six more killings |work= |publisher= Reuters |date= 3 November 2011 |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/03/us-crime-grimsleeper-idUSTRE7A20L120111103 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rubin |first= Joel |title= Police link 6 more slayings to Grim Sleeper suspect |work= Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date= 29 October 2011 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/29/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-20111029 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Olivia |first= Katrandjian |author2=Lauren Effron |author3=Lauren Sher |author4=Neal Karlinsky |title= Six More Deaths Linked to Grim Sleeper Serial Killer |work= abc NIGHTLINE |publisher= abc NEWS |date= 29 October 2011 |url= http://abcnews.go.com/US/deaths-linked-grim-sleeper-serial-killer/story?id=14842183#.TwMkn_KDtXU |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2016, after nearly three months of trial and a day and a half of jury deliberation, Lonnie David Franklin was convicted of 10 counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc7.com/news/lonnie-franklin-jr-found-guilty-in-grim-sleeper-case/1325243/|title=Lonnie Franklin Jr. found guilty in 'Grim Sleeper' case|website=ABC7 Los Angeles|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-grim-sleeper-verdict-20160504-story.html|title=Guilty verdicts in Grim Sleeper serial killer case|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 2016, a Los Angeles County jury sentenced the serial killer to death, closing an important legal chapter in the grisly slayings that terrorized South L.A. for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-grim-sleeper-death-verdict-20160606-snap-story.html|title=Jurors vote for death sentence for 'Grim Sleeper' serial killer|first=James Queally, Marisa|last=Gerber|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
The known killings began in 1985 in [[South Los Angeles]]. The &quot;Grim Sleeper&quot; apparently took a 14-year hiatus after his last known crime in 1988 and the murders that resumed in 2002 (leading to the epithet by which he is known), but this history may be only an accident of the evidence collected. The last confirmed slaying was in January 2007.&lt;ref name=abcnews1/&gt; All of his victims were found outdoors, often in alleys a short distance from downtown [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/07/07/arrest-la-grim-sleeper-killings/|title=Arrest Made in L.A.

All but one of his victims were black women.

He shot all of his victims with a .25 caliber gun.&lt;ref name=abcnews1/&gt; Franklin took many [[photograph]]s of nude women and kept the records in his garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100708/ap_on_re_us/us_grim_sleeper_killings_23|title=Accused LA Serial Killer Said to Visit Prostitutes |publisher=Yahoo!

'''Grimgor Ironhide''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer Fantasy]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]]. He is an [[Orc (Warhammer)|Orcish]] &quot;Warboss&quot;, who controls various{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} factions of [[Black Orc]]s.

== History ==

=== The Beginning ===

{{In-universe|subject = Warhammer|category = Warhammer 40,000|date = October 2009}}

No one knows of Grimgor’s early history. He came from the east, staggering out the Blasted Wastes with an unknown number of grizzled, tired and hungry [[Black Orc]] [[bodyguard]]s, now known to other Orcs as &quot;Da Immortulz&quot; (The Immortals). Upon entering the northern portion of the Worlds Edge Mountains he quickly took over the first tribes of Greenskins he came upon and within a month had carved out a small empire for himself. From there he set course on a campaign of destruction that the northern Worlds Edge Mountains had rarely seen in their history.

It was quickly understood that Grimgor was no ordinary greenskin. His lust for battle was tremendous; always he looked for the heaviest fighting and the strongest opponent to test his skills upon. The first to feel Grimgor’s wrath were the [[Dwarf (Warhammer)|Dwarfs]] of Karak Kadrin. In the many battles that followed, the Dwarfs witnessed defeat after defeat at the hands of Grimgor and his followers. Grimgor never once tried to take the Dwarf hold itself, always content to kill the armies that were sent out to defeat him. The Dwarfs lost so many warriors that in the end they had no choice but to sit behind the walls and mighty doors of Karak Kadin and wait for the fast approaching winter to do what they could not do: force Grimgor to retreat.

Grimgor however would not wait. Becoming bored of killing Dwarfs, he turned his army north and west, crossing the mountains, down Peak Pass and into [[Kislev (Warhammer)|Kislev]]. Again Grimgor’s army could not be stopped, towns were destroyed and their inhabitants killed. Three Kislevite armies were sent to stop this new menace and all three armies were destroyed. As Grimgor approached the city of Kislev itself, nature turned against Grimgor. A huge blizzard, summoned by the [[Ice Queen of Kislev]], struck the advancing greenskin horde. Thousands of [[goblins]] froze to death and dozens more died at the hands of Grimgor as he raged against being stopped on his road of destruction. Orc [[Shaman]]s began to speak of the storm as unnatural and in the end Grimgor had to turn his horde around and head back into the mountains. As he marched away from Kislev the storm abated but as soon as Grimgor turned back to Kislev, the storm would rage up again stopping him in his tracks. He returned to the World Edge Mountains in a rage, wishing for an enemy to crush.

Grimgor decided that he needed a base from which he could strike out at the world around him. He took up residence in the abandoned Dwarf hold of Karak Ungor, conquering the Night Goblin tribes who lived there. From Karak Ungor Grimgor could strike at the Dwarfs of the World Edge Mountains and the humans of Kislev and the Empire in the spring and summer. In the winter Grimgor would retire to the lower levels of the hold and fight the Skaven who tried to invade the fallen hold.

=== Battles with the Skaven ===

Before the coming of Grimgor, the upper levels of Karak Ungor was held by the Night Goblin tribe known as the Red Eyes. The Red Eyes, for many years, had been battling with a foe for the lower reaches of the dwarves hold. These foes were the Skaven of Clan Mor and Clan Moulder. Upon hearing of the Skaven below Grimgor and his Black Orcs quickly joined the battle. Hundreds of Skaven died at the hand of Grimgor and his boyz but this, unsurprisingly, seemed not to matter to the Skaven. Every time that one force was destroyed and the tunnels cleared of rats, new hidden tunnels would be discovered and hundreds more Skaven would leap out of the darkness to attack the Orcs and Goblins of Grimgor’s army.

Grimgor had found his never-ending battle and was content. In the spring he would lead a portion of his forces out to attack the lands above and in the winter he would return, head deep into the tunnels of Karak Ungor and the World Edge Mountains to slaughter Skaven.

As time passed (there is no idea of the time length, since GW does not publish many dates) Grimgor and his horde began to drive the Skaven back deeper and deeper into the tunnels of the World Edge Mountains. The losses on both sides were tremendous. Grimgor did not care about the losses since the battle was all that was important. The leadership of Clan Moulder was becoming concerned. Grimgor was pushing the Skaven back and, unknown to him, he was approaching the border of Clan Moulder's home base, &quot;Hell Pit&quot;. One Skaven in particular was becoming especially concerned - Throt the Unclean. The Master Moulder himself saw Grimgor as a threat not to his people, but to his experiments. Grimgor was getting too close to his personal lab and his toys. To put a stop to this threat, Throt gathered together his strongest Rat Ogres and unleashed them on the approaching Orc horde, taking Grimgor and his Orcs by surprise. The dozens of Rat Ogres were, at first, able to drive the invaders back until Grimgor got over his surprise. Smiling, he quickly found a spot from where he could fight back against this new challenge. Placing himself in a narrow tunnel, Grimgor stood alone against the Rat Ogres while the Orcs and Goblins fled back to the upper levels. For hours Grimgor battled the Rat Ogres, killing all that came against him. Soon the Rat Ogres and Skaven pulled back, unable to defeat this mad green monster. Upon hearing of the defeat of his mutant Rat Ogres, Throt became enraged. It seemed that he would personally have to confront this menace to his peace. Gathering up his most dangerous creations, Throt marched out to face Grimgor but the green monster was gone. Already in a rage over having to stop his experiments to deal with the Greenskin threat and now finding that Grimgor had disappeared back to the upper reaches of Karak Ungor, Throt unleashed his deadly mutant creations upon the empire.

=== New Challenges ===

Grimgor did not flee the tunnels beneath the World Edge Mountains because he feared the approach of Throt. He did not even realize that the mad Skaven was on his way. Instead, it was boredom that made Grimgor return to Karak Ungor. After his battle with the Rat Ogres, Grimgor had become bored. He saw the Rat Ogres as the best that the Skaven could send against him and after facing that challenge there was nothing left for him to do. The years of killing Skaven, humans and dwarfs no longer interested him and so he turned his attention elsewhere to find new challenges.

Gathering up his army, Grimgor set a course north and east. He was going to attempt to cross the treacherous region where the World Edge Mountains met the Mountains of Mourn. No other army had ever successfully made the crossing and this became more of a reason for Grimgor to succeed. Once again he conquered the challenge but no sooner did his army make it across the first mountain range than they found a second in their path. Grimgor ordered his army onwards, the weaker Goblins perishing in the hundreds from the cold and snow, dozens more fell to Grimgor’s axe as they tried to flee back the way they came. The rest of the army, mainly Orcs by now, marched on fearing Grimgor more than they feared the mountains and winter. A week later the horde had done the impossible. They had crossed the second mountain range and reached the open steppes, east of the World Edge Mountains (The Great Skull Land).

=== Forces of the Dark Gods ===

No sooner had the Greenskin horde made camp in the open steppes for the night than the sentries spied a huge cloud of dust on the horizon. Grimgor ordered scouts out to see what threat could be approaching. Returning the scouts reported a massive band of marauding warriors on horseback racing towards the camp.

These horsemen were the Kurgan tribe known as the Yusak. Savage warriors who were as at home on horseback as on foot. They were also followers of the Dark Gods of Chaos. The Yusak had heard of the approaching greenskin horde and had gathered to meet it in battle for the glory of their gods. Grimgor ordered his worn out army out to meet this approaching horde. Neither army paused in their advance, both seeking to press home the attack. The Kurgans initial charge looked at first that it would break the Greenskins ranks but the sheer numbers of Orcs enveloped the Kurgans, pulling the horsemen from the saddles, stalling the charge. The battle was furious and lasted several hours. As the first rays of the sun broke over the mountains, all that remained of the Kurgan force was broken and dead men and horses. Grimgor stood upon a mound of dead, howling to the sun in triumphant exultation.

Grimgor, seeing how savagely the Yusak fought, decided that here in this new land was possibly a challenge that he would like. Ordering his army on, he set up camp in the heart of Kurgan lands, which was the shortest and quickest route to the lands of the Empire. So, to raid and plunder the lands to the west, the marauding tribes of the dark gods would have to pass through Grimgor and his horde to reach them or to take a long diversion.

As word spread, tribes of marauding warriors would gather to test themselves against the &quot;Green Daemon&quot; and his horde. As time passed many Black Orcs from the East and Orcs and Goblins from the World Edge Mountains swelled Grimgor’s army. Once again Grimgor was content. He had found another never-ending battle.

On a side note, Grimgor’s action to block the closest route to Kislev and the Empire (High Pass) had allowed those two nations to regain their losses and strength, benefiting the Empire greatly.

=== The Storm Gathers and Breaks ===

As Grimgor sat along the most direct route to the Empire from the East, storm clouds of war were gathering further to the North. The forces of Chaos were gathering under the banner of Archaon, the Lord of End Times and his followers. North of the Great Skull Lands thousands of tribes of Kurgan marauders gather under the banner of Archaon's herald, Crom the Conqueror, The Bringer of Storms. In time, the land to the North could no longer contain or maintain the tribes, and in a bloodthirsty flood the Horde of Chaos descended South into the Great Skull Lands. Like locusts over crops, the wild-eyed Kurgan tribesmen ravaged all before them. Hundreds of Greenskins that were caught in their path were destroyed. Crom was leading his army South and then West towards High Pass, towards the Empire, towards Grimgor.

=== High Pass ===

As Crom reached the foothills below the pass, he found his way blocked by rank upon rank of Orcs and Goblins. Unlike the other Greenskins his forces had overrun on their march, these Greenskins appeared well ordered and ready for battle. This was the army of Grimgor. Grimgor having become bored once more by the challenge offered by the tribes of the steppes had eagerly ordered his army North upon hearing of the approach of Crom. Here again was a challenge worth facing. Arriving ahead of the Chaos Horde, Grimgor ordered his force to block the mouth of the pass, making sure that Crom and his army would have no other choice but to face him.

As the sun rose from behind the Mountain of Mourn the two armies met. This would become the greatest battle that had ever been seen in the Dark Lands.

The two armies collided in battle, Men and Greenskins died in the hundreds, the Kurgans warriors fought for their Lord Crom and their Dark Gods like men possessed, the Orcs and Goblins indifferent to their losses fought just for the joy of battle and killing. But this time it was the Greenskins that faltered. Never before had they faced men who fought with such blood-rage. For every man cut down, 2 or 3 were there to take their place, there seemed no end to them. They had met an opponent that was just as indifferent to losses as they were, an army of men so unlike the weak men of the west. After hours of battle, with thousands killed on both sides it was the Orcs that were defeated and who fled the battlefield.

=== Defeat? ===

As the battle was raging Grimgor was still looking for an opponent that could give him a challenge. All the Kurgan that he had faced and killed did little to satisfy his need. Fighting in the thick of the battle he fought his way deep into the Chaos hordes lines, fighting and killing dozens as he raged about without finding a worthy opponent. Then he saw Crom. Like Grimgor, Crom easily bested any who faced him. Goblins, Orcs, Black Orcs, boar riders and trolls all died to his sword and axe. Crom too was looking for an opponent that would test his skill. Then Crom saw Grimgor.

As each set eyes on the other, both knew they had finally met a worthy opponent. The fight was one of epic scale. For hours they fought as their two armies battled around them. Both gaining the advantage at times but neither able to kill the other. As the sun began to set Crom and Grimgor pulled apart each staring at the other with respect, wondering how to end the other's life. After several minutes Crom stepped back lowering his weapon, signalling an end to their fight. Grimgor howled in rage at the insult, wanting to continue combat. As Crom stood silently, Grimgor looked around for the first time since the battle began. All he saw was dead bodies and the army of Chaos, his army had fled into the mountains. Looking back at Crom and the Chaos warriors around them Grimgor retreated slowly back daring any to stop him. Once clear he turned and fled slowly South away from the High Pass. For the first time Grimgor had been defeated. For the first time he had failed to master a challenge.

Grimgor's own personal standard was almost captured during the battle, a Champion of Chaos about to break it over his knee, until a Black Orc called Taugrek jumped in, throttling the Chaos Champion with his bare hands, before claiming the standard and fleeing with the rest of Grimgor's army.

As the days passed and Grimgor gathered up his scattered forces, he felt the unfamiliar pangs eating away at his pride. He vowed that he would absolve himself in the eyes of Mork and Gork, the Orc Gods. He vowed that he would gather together the greatest WAAAGH!! that the world had ever known, so massive and destructive that it would wipe away the stain of his loss.

Grimgor blamed his defeat on the inclusion of smaller, weedier greenskins such as [[Goblins (Warhammer)|Goblins]] in his army and decided to rearrange his horde to include only the biggest and best of the Boyz.  Grimgor slaughtered all the remaining Goblins and gathered all the biggest, toughest boyz around. The resulting army came to be known as ''Grimgor's 'Ardboyz'' (Hardboys), an Orc army with an unusually large number of Black Orcs and Big 'Uns.  The 'Ardboyz were also known to carry a huge stone effigy of Gork with them into battle.  Grimgor also constructed a pair of massive siege engines, one was a huge battering ram, and the other a giant catapult. These were also made in the image of Gork and Mork, essentially Fantasy versions of [[Titan (Warhammer 40,000)#Ork Gargants|Gargants]].

=== Storm of Chaos ===

Year 2522

In the Empire, the forces of good have gathered together to prepare for the invasion of Chaos from the North. In council, information from all the races is shared so that they can work out a strategy that will save the Old World from destruction. It is from this information that we hear about Grimgor and his defeat. The Dwarves of the World Edge Mountains have brought forth the following:

&quot;The Orcs and Goblins tribes of the World Edge Mountains are flocking to the banner of Grimgor Ironhide, who had fought a long time against the marauding Kurgan tribes but had now thrown in his lot with the fighters of the Dark Gods. Why he had done this is not known but rumour has it that this was the first time he had been defeated in battle. He now sought to prove himself again in the eyes of his own gods. Other Orc chieftains and warlords are doing the same. Joining forces with the champions of Chaos for the fierce battle and looting that the invasion would bring.&quot;

=== Da Best? ===
As the hour seemed dark for the Empire, Valten finally brought the Everchosen, [[Archaon]], to single combat. In revenge for the steed he had lost to Chaos artillery, Valten first destroyed Archaon's daemonic mount, hurling the Chaos Warlord to the ground. Raising the Hammer of Sigmar high for the killing stroke, Archaon quickly unleashed the power  within his daemon weapon, impaling Valten. Diverted but not stayed, Valten's blow still opened Archaon's armour and dashed him to the ground. As Valten tried to pull Archaon's blade free, Archaon regained his feet and dealt Valten another mortal blow, carving open his breastplate and sending him onto his back. Seemingly in shock at seeing the mark of Sigmar on Valten's chest, Archaon was charged by Luthor Huss, who landed a series of blows upon the Everchosen, including an almighty blow to the head that sent him down to one knee. Archaon overcame Huss, however, and hurled him across the battlefield.

Panting and bleeding, Archaon's head met that of the Orc Warlord, Grimgor Ironhide. Splintering the Chaos lord's shield and sending him sprawling, Grimgor battered Archaon twice around the face before placing his axe on the tip of his foe's throat. Rather than strike the final blow, Grimgor spared his opponent, letting him slump to the ground. The Orc proclaimed 'Grimgor iz da best!' and quit the field, cheered by his followers.

=== Nemesis Crown ===

In the coming [[Games Workshop]] online campaign [[Nemesis Crown]], Grimgor is the focus of the [[Orcs &amp; Goblins]] part of the campaign. Grimgor isn't interested in the powers of the crown itself, rather he believes that if he acquires the crown it will cause the most powerful warriors of the world to attack him, thus guaranteeing Grimgor what he enjoys the most, a good fight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nemesis.ne.games-workshop.com/introduction/armies/orcs.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Gaming ==

In the Warhammer Fantasy games, Grimgor Ironhide was one of the strongest characters. He is always followed by Orcs of great stature &amp; carries Gitsnik, (meaning &quot;foe killer&quot; in parliamentary tongue), a hugely powerful axe and wears the blood-forged armour.
Grimgor's 'Ardboyz is also a separate army list from the normal Orc and Goblin Army. It contains many of the same troop types, but relies mainly on brute force rather than cunning. It should be noted that the Storm of Chaos army lists are now banned from tournaments, however this does not stop people from using the army list in friendly games. Grimgor must be accompanied by a unit of Black Orcs otherwise he cannot be used in a game.

'''''Grindhouse''''' is a 2007 American [[horror film]] [[double feature]] co-written, produced, and directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]]. The double feature consists of two feature-length segments, Rodriguez's ''[[Planet Terror]]'' and Tarantino's ''[[Death Proof]]'', and is bookended by fictional trailers for upcoming attractions (though two of the trailers, ''[[Machete (film)|Machete]]'' and ''[[Hobo with a Shotgun]]'', have since been made into movies), advertisements, and in-theater announcements. The film's title derives from the U.S. film industry term &quot;[[grindhouse]]&quot;, which refers to (now mostly defunct) movie theaters specializing in [[B movie]]s, often [[exploitation film]]s, shown in a multiple-feature format. The film stars [[Rose McGowan]], [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]], [[Marley Shelton]], [[Michael Biehn]], [[Jeff Fahey]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Naveen Andrews]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Kurt Russell]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Tracie Thoms]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], and stuntwoman [[Zoë Bell]], who plays herself.

Rodriguez's segment, ''Planet Terror'', revolves around an outfit of rebels attempting to survive an onslaught of [[zombie]]-like creatures as they feud with a rogue military unit, while Tarantino's segment, ''Death Proof'', focuses on a [[Misogyny|misogynistic]], psychopathic [[stuntman]] who targets young women, murdering them with his &quot;death proof&quot; stunt car. Each feature is preceded by faux [[Trailer (film)|trailers]] of exploitation films in other genres that were developed by other directors.

After the film was released on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In much of the rest of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on ''Grindhouse'''s fake trailers: ''[[Machete (film)|Machete]]'', ''[[Machete Kills]]'' and ''[[Hobo with a Shotgun]]''.

==''Planet Terror''==
{{Main|Planet Terror}}
In a rural town in Texas, [[go-go dancer]] Cherry Darling decides to quit her low-paying job and find another use for her numerous &quot;useless&quot; talents. She runs into mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray at the Bone Shack, a restaurant owned by J. T. Hague. Meanwhile, a group of military officials, led by the demented Lt. Muldoon, are making a business transaction with a scientist named Abby for mass quantities of a deadly biochemical agent known as DC2 (codename &quot;Project Terror&quot;). Muldoon learns that Abby has an extra supply on hand and attempts to take him hostage. Abby intentionally releases the gas into the air. The gas reaches the town and turns its residents into deformed bloodthirsty, man-eating psychopaths, mockingly referred to as &quot;sickos&quot; by the surviving humans. The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block and his abused, neglected anesthesiologist wife Dakota at a local hospital. As the patients quickly become enraged aggressors, Cherry and El Wray lead a team of accidental warriors into the night, struggling to find safety.

==Fictitious trailers==
Before each segment, there are [[trailer (film)|trailers]] advertising fake films, as well as vintage [[Snipe (theatrical)|theater snipes]] and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for ''Grindhouse''. &quot;I didn't even know about it until I read it in the trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt; Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, &quot;We had so many ideas for trailers. I made ''Machete''. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to [[Eli Roth]] and to [[Edgar Wright]], and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then [[Rob Zombie]] came up to me in October at the [[Scream Awards]] and said, 'I have a trailer: ''Werewolf Women of the SS''.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wizard&quot;/&gt; Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-Trailers&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Olsen|first=Mark|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/01/entertainment/ca-middle1|title=These plotlines get hacked to bits|date=April 1, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Canadian screening releases included the [[South by Southwest]]-winning trailer ''Hobo with a Shotgun''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2007/04/03/grindhouse-trailer-eisener.html|title=N.S. filmmaker's fake-movie trailer to open for ''Grindhouse''|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 3, 2007|publisher=CBC Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Machete''===
{{See also|Machete (film)}}
Rodriguez wrote ''Machete'' in 1993 as a full feature for [[Danny Trejo]]. &quot;I had cast him in ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and I remember thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of [[Mexploitation]] movies like [[Charles Bronson]] or like [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]].' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes [[FBI]] or [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt; The trailer was made into a [[Machete (film)|feature film]] which was released in September 2010; a sequel, ''[[Machete Kills]]'' (2013), followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=''Grindhouseses'': Rodriguez to turn ''They Call Him Machete'' into Feature Length Movie|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=March 12, 2007|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/12/grindhouse-rodriguez-to-turn-they-call-him-machete-into-feature-length-movie/|publisher=Slash Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070514_machete_movie_greenlit.html  |title=Machete movie greenlit!|accessdate=May 12, 2009|last=Morris|first=Clint|date=May 14, 2007|publisher=Moviehole |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040812/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070514_machete_movie_greenlit.html |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Werewolf Women of the SS''===
[[Rob Zombie]]'s contribution, ''Werewolf Women of the SS'', starred [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[Fu Manchu]]; [[Udo Kier]] as Franz Hess, the commandant of Death Camp 13; Zombie's wife, [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri]]; and [[Sybil Danning]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers/sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp (The She-Devils of Belzac). Professional wrestlers [[Test (wrestler)|Andrew &quot;Test&quot; Martin]] and [[Vladimir Kozlov|Oleg &quot;Vladimir Kozlov&quot; Prudius]] also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, &quot;Basically, I had two ideas. It was either going to be a [[Nazi exploitation|Nazi movie]] or a [[Women in prison film|women-in-prison film]], and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like ''[[Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS]]''; ''[[Fräulein Devil]]''; and ''[[Love Camp 7]]''—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt; Zombie is also quoted as saying &quot;I was getting very conceptual in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, so I took that approach.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-Trailers&quot;/&gt;

===''Don't''===
[[Edgar Wright]]'s contribution, ''Don't'', was produced in the style of a 1970s' [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer House of Horror]] film trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Elaine |last=Lamkin |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20070108edgarwrightgrindhouse |title=Shaun of the Grindhouse |date=January 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2009 |publisher=Slash Film |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213023431/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20070108edgarwrightgrindhouse |archivedate=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer featured appearances from [[Jason Isaacs]], [[Matthew Macfadyen]], singer [[Katie Melua]], [[Lee Ingleby]], [[Georgina Chapman]], [[Emily Booth]], [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]], [[Lucy Punch]], [[Rafe Spall]], Wright regulars [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Nick Frost]], and a voice-over by [[Will Arnett]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-Trailers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/film/us-box-office-horror-grindhouse-$1074930.htm|title=US box office horror for Grindhouse |date=April 9, 2007|publisher=inthenews.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Gatiss]], [[MyAnna Buring]], [[Peter Serafinowicz]], [[Michael Smiley]] and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie &quot;Mary&quot; in ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances.  To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-Trailers&quot;/&gt; According to Wright, &quot;In the '70s, when [[American International Pictures|American International]] would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called ''[[Let Sleeping Corpses Lie (film)|The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue]]''. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called ''Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead''. But in the States, it was called ''Don't Open the Window''. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you what the hell is going on in the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt; On the [[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]] talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8920808219270015571#30m05s|title=Charlie Rose – Lawrence Wright / Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Thanksgiving''===
[[File:Thanksgiving032807.jpg|thumb|right|Eli Roth directs the fictitious trailer ''Thanksgiving''.]]
[[Eli Roth]]'s contribution is a promo for the slasher opus ''Thanksgiving''. Produced in the style of holiday-themed slasher films like ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'', ''[[April Fool's Day (1986 film)|April Fool's Day]]'' and ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-Trailers&quot;/&gt; the trailer starred Jeff Rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a [[pilgrim]]; [[Jordan Ladd]], [[Jay Hernandez]], and Roth himself as his intended victims; and [[Michael Biehn]] as the Sheriff. The design for the titles in ''Thanksgiving'' was based on a ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine slasher parody titled ''Arbor Day''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt; Excerpts of the score from ''[[Creepshow]]'' were used in the faux trailer.

According to Roth, &quot;My friend Jeff, who plays the killer pilgrim – we grew up in [[Massachusetts]], we were huge slasher movie fans and every November we were waiting for the [[Thanksgiving]] slasher movie. We had the whole movie worked out: A kid who's [[bestiality|in love with a turkey]], and then his father killed it, and then he killed his family and went away to a mental institution and came back and took revenge on the town. I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, guess what, we don't have to make the movie, we can just shoot the best parts.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt; &quot;Shooting the trailer was so much fun,&quot; Roth has stated, &quot;because every shot is a [[money shot]]. Every shot is decapitation or nudity. It's so ridiculous, it's absurd. It's just so wrong and sick that it's right.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-Trailers&quot;/&gt;

Roth's fake trailer contained elements that almost earned ''Grindhouse'' an [[NC-17]] rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting stabbed in the [[vulva]], and three [[decapitation]]s; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in a exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs [[fellatio]] on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, &quot;Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. But we had a great discussion with the ratings board. They got it. Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-Trailers&quot;/&gt; Roth confirmed in an interview with Cinema Blend's Eric Eisenberg that he and co-writer Jeff Rendell are working on a possible feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemablend.com/new/Eli-Roth-Confirms-He-s-Working-On-A-Thanksgiving-Movie-20320.html|title=Eli Roth Confirms He's Working On A Thanksgiving Movie|author=Eric Eisenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hobo with a Shotgun''===
{{See also|Hobo with a Shotgun}}
Some screenings of ''Grindhouse'' (mainly in Canada) also featured a fake trailer for a film titled ''Hobo with a Shotgun''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobo&quot;/&gt; The trailer, created by [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]] filmmakers [[Jason Eisener]], John Davies, and Rob Cotterill, won Robert Rodriguez's [[South by Southwest]] ''Grindhouse'' trailers contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSWHobo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=James|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article747461.ece|title=Two minutes to hell – and glory|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=March 31, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the trailer, David Brunt plays a [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]] with a 20-gauge [[shotgun]] (changed to a 12-gauge for the actual movie) who becomes a [[vigilante]].

==History and development==
[[File:Dragstrip Girl Rock All Night double feature poster.jpg|left|thumb|The poster for a double feature consisting of the films ''Dragstrip Girl'' and ''[[Rock All Night]]'' sparked the idea for ''Grindhouse''.]]
The idea for ''Grindhouse'' came to [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]] when Tarantino set up screenings of double features in his house, complete with trailers before and in between the films. During one screening in 2003, Rodriguez noticed that he owned the same double feature movie poster as Tarantino for the 1957 films ''Dragstrip Girl'' and ''[[Rock All Night]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiscock|first=John|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3664742/Quentin-Tarantino-Im-proud-of-my-flop.html|title=Quentin Tarantino: I'm proud of my flop|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 27, 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodriguez asked Tarantino, &quot;I always wanted to do a double feature. Hey, why don't you direct one and I'll do the other?&quot; Tarantino quickly replied, &quot;And we've got to call it ''Grindhouse''!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloodbath&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|title=Bloodbath and Beyond|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 30, 2007|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015706,00.html|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's name originates from the American term for theaters that played &quot;all the [[Exploitation film|exploitation]] genres: [[Kung fu film|kung fu]], [[horror film|horror]], [[Giallo]], [[sexploitation]], the 'good old boy' [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] car-chase movies, [[blaxploitation]], [[spaghetti Western]]s—all those risible genres that were released in the 70s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Gavin|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/14022408/online_exclusive_horror_film_directors_dish_about_grindhouse_trailers|title=Online Exclusive: Horror Film Directors Dish About 'Grindhouse' Trailers|date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501084049/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/14022408/online_exclusive_horror_film_directors_dish_about_grindhouse_trailers |archivedate = May 1, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rodriguez, &quot;The posters were much better than the movies, but we're actually making something that lives up to the posters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wizard&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cotton|first=Mike|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004090803.cfm |title=House Party|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 4, 2007|work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Universe]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211040830/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004090803.cfm |archivedate = December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodriguez first came up with the idea for ''Planet Terror'' during the production of ''[[The Faculty]]'': &quot;I remember telling [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Josh Hartnett]], all these young actors, that [[zombie]] movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [a script] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [movie] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'&quot; The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for ''Grindhouse.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Wizard&quot;/&gt;

As ''Planet Terror'' took shape, Tarantino developed the story for ''Death Proof'', based on his fascination for the way [[stunt man|stuntmen]] would &quot;death-proof&quot; their cars. As long as they were driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a [[slasher film]] featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his &quot;death-proof&quot; car.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wizard&quot;/&gt; Tarantino remembers, &quot;I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of [[Women in prison films|women-in-prison films]], there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do. My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt;

According to Rodriguez, &quot;[Tarantino] had an idea and a complete vision for it right away when he first talked about it. He started to tell me the story and said, 'It's got this death-proof car in it.' I said, 'You have to call it ''Death Proof.''' I helped title the movie, but that's it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wizard&quot;/&gt; Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, &quot;[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in ''[[Terminator 2]]''. And ''[[Final Destination 2]]'' had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel it in my stomach. It's just action.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt;

==Production==

===Direction===
According to actress [[Marley Shelton]], &quot;Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, at least ''Planet Terror''. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and adjustments to our performances and he changed lines every once in a while. Of course, he always deferred to Robert on ''Planet Terror'' and vice versa for ''Death Proof''. So it's really both of their brainchild.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fangoria-Shelton&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Spelling|first=Ian|url=http://www.fangoria.com/fearful_feature.php?id=4019 |title=Doctor in the Grindhouse|accessdate=May 11, 2009|work=[[Fangoria]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224030717/http://www.fangoria.com/fearful_feature.php?id=4019 |archivedate = December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarantino has stated, &quot;I can't imagine doing ''Grindhouse'' with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, and pretty much that was it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt;

===Casting===
Many of the cast members had previously worked with both directors. Before appearing in ''Grindhouse'', Marley Shelton had auditioned for ''[[The Faculty]]'', but Rodriguez chose not to cast her. She was eventually cast in the role of a customer in the opening sequence of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fangoria-Shelton&quot;/&gt; [[Bruce Willis]] had appeared in both Tarantino's ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' and Rodriguez's ''Sin City'', in addition to having a cameo appearance in a segment Tarantino directed for the [[anthology film]] ''[[Four Rooms]]''. [[Tom Savini]] had previously acted in ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]'', which was written by Tarantino and directed by Rodriguez. [[Michael Parks]] reprises the role of [[Earl McGraw]] in ''Planet Terror'' and ''Death Proof''. Parks first portrayed the role in ''From Dusk Till Dawn''. His son, James, appears in ''Death Proof'' as [[Edgar McGraw]], a character that first appeared in ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money]]''. The first time the two characters appeared together was in Tarantino's ''[[Kill Bill]]''. Tarantino himself plays small roles in both segments of ''Grindhouse'', and director [[Eli Roth]], who contributed the fake trailer ''Thanksgiving'' and whose film ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' was produced by Tarantino, has a cameo in ''Death Proof''.

Tarantino attempted to cast both [[Kal Penn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061121kalpenngrindhouse|title=Did You Know: Kal Penn was cast in Tarantino's ''Grindhouse''?|accessdate=May 12, 2009|publisher=Slash Film}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sylvester Stallone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061204stallonegrindhouse|title=Tarantino wanted Stallone for ''Grindhouse''|accessdate=May 12, 2009|publisher=Slash Film}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Death Proof'', but both were unable to work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed that he decided to cast [[Kurt Russell]] as the killer stunt driver because &quot;for people of my generation, he's a true hero...but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. When I open the newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in ''[[Dreamer (2005 film)|Dreamer]],''' or 'Kurt Russell in ''[[Miracle (film)|Miracle]]'',' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell going to be a badass again?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloodbath&quot;/&gt;

===Cinematography===
Rodriguez and Tarantino each acted as [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] on their segments. Although Rodriguez had previously worked as the cinematographer on six of his own feature films, ''Death Proof'' marked Tarantino's first credit as a cinematographer. The director of photography for [[Rob Zombie]]'s fake trailer ''Werewolf Women of the SS'' was Phil Parmet, whom Zombie had first worked with on ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]''. The director of photography for Eli Roth's fake trailer ''Thanksgiving'' was Milan Chadima, whom Roth had previously worked with on ''Hostel''.

===Special effects===
[[File:Grind07 Grindhouse.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The intentionally &quot;aged&quot; look of the film, as seen in the trailer ''Machete''.]]
Though set in the modern day, the film uses various unconventional techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged to make it look like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in ''Planet Terror'', five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.&lt;ref name=&quot;VFX&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bielik|first=Alain|publisher=VFX World|title=Grindhouse: Pistol-Packing VFX|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&amp;code=319b255d&amp;atype=articles&amp;id=3235|date=April 6, 2007|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Planet Terror'' makes heavy use of digital effects throughout the film. Perhaps the most notable effect is Cherry's ([[Rose McGowan]]) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots and replaced it with computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an [[M16 rifle]]. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.&lt;ref name=&quot;VFX&quot;/&gt;

===Editing===
During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up with the idea of inserting &quot;missing reels&quot; into the film. &quot;[Quentin] was about to show an Italian crime movie with [[Oliver Reed]],&quot; Rodriguez recalls, &quot;and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wizard&quot;/&gt;

On the editing of ''Death Proof'', Tarantino stated &quot;There is half-an-hour's difference between my ''Death Proof'' and what is playing in ''Grindhouse''. [...] I was like a brutish American exploitation distributor who cut the movie down almost to the point of incoherence. I cut it down to the bone and took all the fat off it to see if it could still exist, and it worked.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt; An extended, 127-minute version of ''Death Proof'' was screened in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival|60th Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackenzie|first=James|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1925328520070419|title=Director Tarantino in competition in Cannes|agency=Reuters  |date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannes archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/index.php/en/archives/film/4432013 |title=Death Proof|publisher=Cannes Film Festival|accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204134/http://www.festival-cannes.com/index.php/en/archives/film/4432013 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarantino is quoted as saying &quot;It works great as a double feature, but I'm just as excited if not more excited about actually having the world see ''Death Proof'' unfiltered. [...] It will be the first time everyone sees ''Death Proof'' by itself, including me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt;

''Grindhouse'' is rated [[PG-Rating|R]] in the United States for &quot;strong graphic bloody violence and gore, [[Profanity|pervasive language]], some [[Sexual content|sexuality]], [[Nudity in film|nudity]], and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]]&quot;. On March 15, 2007, ''[[The New York Post]]'' reported that the film would possibly require heavy and extensive cuts in order to avoid an [[NC-17]] rating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rating&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Johnson|author2=Froelich, Paula |author3=Hoffmann, Bill |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03152007/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm|title=Page Six: Rating Woes for 'Grindhouse'|accessdate=May 11, 2009|date=March 15, 2007 |work=The New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the film officially received an R-rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]. [[Ain't It Cool News]] reported that according to Tarantino, only minimal cuts were made which ended up totaling 20 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;AICN-Rating&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Harry|last=Knowles|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/31991|title=Austinites!

===Soundtrack influences===
{{Main|Planet Terror (soundtrack)|Death Proof (soundtrack)}}
The music for ''Planet Terror'' was composed by Rodriguez. Inspiration for his score came from [[John Carpenter]], whose music was often played on set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Quint|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=23947|title=Updated!

The soundtrack for ''Death Proof'' consists entirely of non-original music, including excerpts from the scores of other films. Soundtrack albums for both segments were released on April 3, 2007.

The opening weekend box office total stood below not only the second weekends of ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' and ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'', but also fell below the opening weekend gross of the widely panned ''[[Are We Done Yet?]]''. In an attempt to explain the film's disappointing opening weekend, box office analyst Brandon Gray suggested that ''Grindhouse'' &quot;suffered the usual horror comedy dilemma that afflicted ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' and ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'' among others: too funny to be scary, too scary to be funny.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;boxoffice&quot;/&gt; Box office analyst Lee Tistaert of tracking website Lee's Movie Info compared the result with what may have happened if Tarantino's ''[[Kill Bill]]'' saga had been released as one film, instead of two separate volumes. &quot;Is it possible that Tarantino got his wish this time as a result of two back-to-back $60&amp;nbsp;million grosses?&quot; he asked. Others attributed the film's disappointing opening to the timing of Easter weekend, noting that the weekend is more tailored for family-oriented films or light-comedy, not exploitative horror films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-105055141.html|registration=yes|title='Blades' Stays on Top With $23&amp;nbsp;Million|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 8, 2007|agency=Associated Press  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's length—running more than three hours—also hurt, keeping away casual theater-goers and limiting the number of screenings that could be held in a day.

Quentin Tarantino was quoted as saying about the film's box office results, &quot;It was disappointing, yeah. But the movie worked with the audience. [...] People who saw it loved it and applauded. [...] I'm proud of my flop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt; [[Harvey Weinstein]] said that he was so &quot;incredibly disappointed&quot; with the film's opening weekend that he was considering re-releasing it as two separate films and possibly adding back the &quot;missing&quot; scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finke|first=Nikki|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/what-went-so-wrong-with-grindhouse|title=Harvey Very Disappointed; May Re-Release 'Grindhouse' As 2 Pics|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 9, 2007|publisher=Deadline Hollywood Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film altogether earned $25,422,088 in ticket sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=grindhouse.htm|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Grindhouse'' was embraced by critics; review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 83% of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 191&amp;nbsp;reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The site's consensus reads, &quot;''Grindhouse'' delivers exhilarating exploitation fare with wit and panache, improving upon its source material with feral intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grindhouse|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526082053/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grindhouse |archivedate = May 26, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the website [[Metacritic]], which utilizes a [[standard score|normalized]] rating system, the film earned a favorable rating of 77/100 based on 36&amp;nbsp;reviews by mainstream critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/grindhouse?q=Grindhouse|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded the film a &quot;B+&quot; rating, praising it as a &quot;crazily funny and exciting tribute to the grimy glory days of 1970s exploitation films&quot; that &quot;will leave you laughing, gasping, thrilled at a movie that knows, at long last, how to put the bad back in badass.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20033672,00.html|title=Grindhouse (2007)|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 4, 2007|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film a positive review, commenting that &quot;by stooping low without selling out, this babes-and-bullets tour de force gets you high on movies again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Travers|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/14022227/review/14022289/grindhouse|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 3, 2007|work=Rolling Stone|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080714132553/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/14022227/review/14022289/grindhouse |archivedate = July 14, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[James Berardinelli]] also enjoyed the film but was not as positive as other critics. Awarding the film three stars (out of four), Berardinelli found the film to be &quot;cinema as an expression of pulp with attitude... [Rodriguez and Tarantino] are speaking from the hearts... but that doesn't mean everyone sitting in the theater will get it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|publisher=Reel Views|year=2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/g/grindhouse.html|title=Grindhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critics who did not like the film were not amused by the film's graphic and comical violence, with Larry Ratliff of ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' noting that &quot;this ambitious, scratched and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on the senses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Larry|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/movies/stories/MYSA040607.WK.grindhouse.ea5eae.html |title=Movie Review: 'Grindhouse'|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 5, 2007|work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011193304/http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/movies/stories/MYSA040607.WK.grindhouse.ea5eae.html |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' awarded the film a high rating, but noted that &quot;the Rodriguez segment is terrific; the Tarantino one long-winded and juvenile.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/04/06/DDGIAP2PIK18.DTL&amp;type=movies|title=Review of ''Grindhouse''|accessdate=May 12, 2009|work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=April 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others considered ''Death Proof'' to be a deeper and more noteworthy segment. Critic [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that &quot;[a]t a certain point in ''Death Proof'' the scratches and bad splices disappear, and you find yourself watching not an arch, clever pastiche of old movies and movie theaters but an actual movie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.O.|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/movies/06grin.html|title=Back to the (Double) Feature|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 6, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] was divided. He gave ''Grindhouse'' as a whole two and a half stars out of four, awarding ''Planet Terror'' two stars and ''Death Proof'' three stars. Ebert also noted the irony of grindhouse films largely being superseded by many big-budget R-rated mainstream films that included a great deal of nudity and graphic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071025/REVIEWS/710250304|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=May 12, 2009|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=October 26, 2007|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics generally enjoyed the fake trailers. Geoff Pevere of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' wrote that the use of the trailers helps the film establish &quot;its credibility as both mock-artifact and geeky fetish object even before the opening feature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pevere|first=Geoff|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/200195|title='Grindhouse': Double-bill cheap thrill|accessdate=September 27, 2009|date=April 6, 2007|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' claimed that the trailers were &quot;excellent candidates for exploitation immortality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117933254.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|date=April 1, 2007|work=Variety }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Vice of ''[[Deseret News]]'', who gave the feature films negative reviews, called the trailers &quot;... the strongest aspect of the entire presentation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vice|first=Jeff|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700004507/Grindhouse.html|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|date=April 6, 2007|work=[[Deseret News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitland McDonagh of ''[[TV Guide]]'' added, &quot;With the exception of ''Werewolf Women'', which tries a little too hard, they're all spot-on pastiches.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonagh|first=Maitland|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/grindhouse-/review/285364|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|work=[[TV Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The double feature appeared at number six on Jack Mathews and Owen Gleiberman's respective top ten lists for ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and at number seven on Stephanie Zacharek's list for ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''. Marc Savlov listed ''Death Proof'' at number ten on his list for ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2007/toptens.shtml|title=Metacritic: 2007 Film Critic Top Ten Lists|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 12, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730001905/http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2007/toptens.shtml |archivedate = July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the possibility of a split in a foreign release, Tarantino stated &quot;Especially if they were dealing with non-English language countries, they don't really have this tradition ... not only do they not really know what a grind house is, they don't even have the double feature tradition.

In the United Kingdom, ''Death Proof'' was released on September 21, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?nid=20659|title=Grindhouse Dismantled|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=April 30, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235327/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?nid=20659 |archivedate = September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of ''Planet Terror'' followed on November 9 with an eventual, theatrical, limited run of the entire Grindhouse feature the following year. ''Death Proof'' was screened in Europe in the extended version that was presented in competition at the Cannes film festival. The additional material includes scenes that were replaced in the American theatrical release version with a &quot;missing reel&quot; title card, such as the [[lap dance]] scene. A total of about 27 minutes were added for this version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=cannes2007&amp;jump=review&amp;reviewid=VE1117933735&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0|title=Death Proof|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=May 22, 2007 |work=Variety|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224044709/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=cannes2007&amp;amp;jump=review&amp;amp;reviewid=VE1117933735&amp;amp;cs=1&amp;amp;p=0 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the edited version of ''Death Proof'' was first screened on November 1, 2007 as a separate film.

''Death Proof'' and ''Planet Terror'' were released separately on [[DVD]] in the United States. The trailers were omitted from ''Death Proof'', with the exception of ''Machete'' which was from ''Planet Terror''. ''Death Proof'' was released on September 18, 2007, with ''Planet Terror'' following on October 16, 2007. Both were two-disc special editions featuring extended versions of the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/chopping_list.php |title=DVD Chopping List |accessdate=May 12, 2009|last=Gingold|first=Michael|date=July 3, 2007|work=[[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011014337/http://www.fangoria.com/chopping_list.php |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/808/808506p1.html|title=DVD SDCC: Grindhouse Gets Cut in Two|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=July 26, 2007|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Rodriguez stated in his 10-Minute Film School that a box set of the two films would be available soon, and that his 10-Minute Cook School would appear on it.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by Robert Rodriguez on the 10-Minute Film School feature on the ''Planet Terror'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt; This release would also reportedly include ''Hobo with a Shotgun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ponto|first=Arya|url=http://www.justpressplay.net/movies/grindhouse/news/grindhouse-gets-proper-dvd-release-comes-with-hobo.html |title='Grindhouse' Gets Proper DVD Release, Comes with 'Hobo'|accessdate=May 12, 2009|publisher=JustPressPlay.net |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071031035416/http://www.justpressplay.net/movies/grindhouse/news/grindhouse-gets-proper-dvd-release-comes-with-hobo.html |archivedate = October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A six-DVD edition of the film was released on March 21, 2008 in Japan, featuring the films in both their individual extended versions and in the abridged double feature presentation along with previously-unreleased special features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butane|first=Johnny|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/node/25718|title=Six Discs of 'Grindhouse'!|date=December 27, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|publisher=DreadCentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Planet Terror'' and ''Death Proof'' were released individually on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on December 16, 2008 in North America.

The first disc of the 2-disc set contains ''Death Proof'' and ''Planet Terror'', along with the faux trailers, including the &quot;trailer&quot; for ''Machete''. The theatrical cut was released on DVD in Canada from [[Alliance Atlantis]]. All of the extras from the previous individual DVD releases were included, however none of the extras from the Special Edition Blu-ray were included.

[[Bill Moseley]] stated at FanExpo on August 27, 2010 that the Blu-ray would also include a 5-minute version of ''Werewolf Women of the SS''.

==Adaptations of the fake trailers==
{{See also|Machete (film)|l1=Machete|Hobo with a Shotgun|Machete Kills}}

In 2010, Rodriguez wrote and co-directed a feature-length adaptation of his fake trailer, ''Machete''. Many of the original actors from the trailer returned to their roles for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sciretta&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Rodriguez to film Machete Movie during ''Sin City 2''|publisher=Slash Film|date=March 26, 2007|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/26/rodriguez-to-film-machete-movie-during-sin-city-2|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Machete'' screened September 1 at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was released across cinemas in the US on September 3, 2010.

''Machete'' turned out to be more of a success at the box office than ''Grindhouse'', grossing $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: ''Machete Kills'' and ''Machete Kills Again''. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting.

The director of a trailer that played in some theaters in the United States and Canada (mainly the latter), ''Hobo with a Shotgun'', [[Jason Eisener]], also made a feature-length adaptation of it. [[Rutger Hauer]] replaced Dave Brunt as the titular character, though Brunt does make a cameo as a corrupt cop.

These two adaptations received mainly positive reviews, with the general consensus being that they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being. Although ''Hobo with a Shotgun'' was not as big a box office success in the U.S. as it was in Canada, it has since gained a cult following there.

Many of the other fake trailer directors have expressed interest in making their trailers into real films, including Edgar Wright and Eli Roth.

Both Rodriguez and Tarantino have said that they are interested in making a [[sequel]] to ''Grindhouse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Sciretta |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061218grindhousesequel |title=Rodriguez talks Grindhouse Sequel |accessdate=May 12, 2009 |date=December 18, 2006 |work=Slash Film |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713202127/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061218grindhousesequel |archivedate=July 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an &quot;old-school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries, and release a shorter, dubbed cut in others&quot; for his segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Sciretta|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/29/tarantino-plans-kung-fu-grindhouse-sequel|title=Tarantino Plans Kung Fu Grindhouse Sequel|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=March 29, 2007|publisher=Slash Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand ''Don't'' into a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=412779|title=Edgar Wright's &quot;Don't&quot; Trailer Could Be &quot;Grindhouse 2&quot; |accessdate=May 12, 2009|first=Jen|last=Yamato|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|date=April 7, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527085504/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=412779 |archivedate = May 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eli Roth, he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing ''Don't'' with ''Thanksgiving'' for a ''Grindhouse'' sequel. Roth is quoted as saying &quot;We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're still trying to figure out ''Grindhouse 1'' before we think about ''Grindhouse 2'', but I've already been working on the outline for it and I would do it in a heartbeat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=418358|title=Roth Wants Full Length &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; for &quot;Grindhouse 3&quot; |accessdate=May 12, 2009|author=RT-News|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|date=May 4, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605234500/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=418358|archivedate=June 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electra and Elise Avellan]], Rodriguez's nieces who play the Crazy Babysitter Twins in both films, originally stated their uncle wanted to do a sequel featuring both ''Machete'' and ''The Babysitter Twins'', but the latter concept did not materialize with the former's release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18089 'Crazy Babysitter Twins' Return to the Big Screen...

A third feature-length film based on the trailers, the Robert Rodriguez-directed ''[[Machete Kills]]'', was released at the end of 2013.

'''Griselda Blanco''' (February 15, 1943 – September 3, 2012), known as ''La Madrina'', ''the Black Widow'', the ''Cocaine Godmother'' and the ''Queen of Narco-Trafficking'', was a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] [[drug lord]] of the [[Medellín Cartel]] and a pioneer in the [[Miami]]-based [[cocaine]] [[illegal drug trade|drug trade]] and [[Organized crime|underworld]] during the 1970s and early 1980s. It has been estimated that she was responsible for up to 200 murders while transporting cocaine from Colombia to New York, Miami and Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/griselda-blanco-20965407 |title=Griselda Blanco|website= Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1942452.html#storylink=cpy |title=The life and death of 'cocaine godmother' Griselda Blanco|newspaper=[[Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Luscombe, Richard&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/godmother-cocaine-shot-dead-colombia |title='Godmother of cocaine' shot dead in Colombia (Griselda Blanco, who remained under suspicion for the deaths of all three of her husbands) |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 4, 2012| author=Luscombe, Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Blanco was born in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], on the country's north coast. She and her mother, Ana Lucía Restrepo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.semana.com/nacion/griselda-blanco-tan-cruel-como-escobar/184299-3.aspx |title=Her mother's name|website=Semana|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; moved to [[Medellín]] when she was three years old. It didn't take long for Blanco to begin living a life of crime. Blanco's former lover Charles Cosby, recounted at the age of 11, Blanco allegedly kidnapped, attempted to ransom and eventually shot a child from an upscale flatland neighborhood near her own neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;maxim&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Searching for the Godmother of Crime |journal=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |url=http://www.maxim.com/humor/articles/57005/searchingforthegodmotherofcrime.html |date=July 2008 |last=Brown |first=Ethan |pages=94–98 |issn=1092-9789 |publisher=Alpha Media Group |accessdate=October 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614094614/http://www.maxim.com/humor/articles/57005/searchingforthegodmotherofcrime.html? |archivedate=June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cowboys2&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=Corben, Billy (director); Cosby, Charles (himself); Blanco, Griselda (herself)|date=July 29, 2008|title=Cocaine Cowboys 2: Hustlin' with the Godmother|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176726|medium=DVD|publisher=Magnolia Home Entertainment|accessdate=October 3, 2010|ASIN=B00180R03Q|id={{UPC|876964001366}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cosby|first=Charles|title=Charles Cosby: From Early Childhood to Cocaine and Hustlin’|url=http://theblogunion.wordpress.com/2009/05/25/charles-cosby-from-early-childhood-to-cocaine-and-hustlin%E2%80%99/|website=The Blog Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanco had become a pickpocket before she even turned 13. To escape the sexual assaults from her mother's boyfriend, Blanco ran away from home at the age of 14 and resorted to looting in Medellín, Colombia until the age of 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;maxim&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cowboys2&quot; /&gt;

===Drug business===
Blanco was a major figure in the history of the drug trade from Colombia to [[Miami, Florida]], and other states across the United States.

In the mid-1970s, Blanco and her second husband Alberto Bravo emigrated to the US, settling in [[Queens, New York]]. They established a sizable cocaine business there, and in April 1975 Blanco was indicted on federal drug conspiracy charges along with 30 of her subordinates. She fled to Colombia before she could be arrested, but returned to Miami in the late 1970s.

====Miami drug war====
Blanco's return to the US from Colombia was the beginning of the Miami drug war.&lt;ref name=&quot;maxim&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cowboys2&quot;/&gt; This violent conflict among cocaine traffickers was associated with the high crime epidemic that swept the City of Miami in the 1980s. Law enforcement's struggle put an end to the influx of cocaine into Miami led to the creation of CENTAC 26 (Central Tactical Unit), a joint operation between [[Miami-Dade Police Department]] and [[DEA]] anti-drug operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3dGino_7DoC|title=Kings of Cocaine: Inside the Medellín Cartel - An Astonishing True Story of Murder, Money and International Corruption|first1=Guy|last1=Gugliotta|first2=Jeff|last2=Leen|date=July 16, 2011|publisher=Garrett County Press|accessdate=June 19, 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/es/read/griselda-blanco-so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-cocaine|title=Griselda Blanco: hasta nunca y gracias por la coca |website=VICE - España|publisher=|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanco was involved in the drug-related violence known as the ''Miami Drug War'' or the ''Cocaine Cowboy Wars'' that plagued Miami in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This was a time when cocaine superseded [[marijuana]] trafficking.&lt;ref name=&quot;cowboys&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=Corben, Billy (director); Roberts, Jon (actor); Sunshine, Al (actor); Burstyn, Sam (actor); Munday, Mickey (actor); Palumbo, Bob (actor)|date=January 23, 2007|title=Cocaine Cowboys|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380268|medium=DVD|publisher=Magnolia Home Entertainment|accessdate=October 3, 2010|ASIN=B000KLQUUS|id={{UPC|876964000635}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the lawless and corrupt atmosphere, primarily created by Blanco's operations, that led to the gangster's being dubbed the &quot;[[Cocaine Cowboys]]&quot; and their violent way of doing business as the &quot;Miami drug war&quot;.

Her distribution network, which spanned the United States, brought in {{currency|80 million|USD}} per month.&lt;ref name=&quot;maxim&quot;/&gt; Her violent business style brought government scrutiny to [[South Florida]], leading to the demise of her organization and the free-wheeling, high-profile Miami drug scene of those times.

In 1984, Blanco's willingness to use violence against her Miami competitors or anyone else who displeased her, led her rivals to make repeated attempts to assassinate her. In an attempt to escape the hits that were called on her, she fled to California.

===Arrest===

On February 20, 1985, she was arrested by [[DEA]] agents  in her home and held without bail. After her trial, Blanco was sentenced to more than a decade in jail.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Griselda Blanco'', 861 F.2d 773 (2d Cir. 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; While in prison, she continued to effectively run her cocaine business.

By pressuring one of Blanco's lieutenants, the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office obtained sufficient evidence to indict Blanco for three murders. However, the case collapsed due to technicalities. In 2004, Blanco was released from prison and deported to [[Medellin, Colombia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maxim&quot;/&gt; Before her death in 2012, the last sighting of Blanco was in May 2007 at the [[Bogota Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maxim&quot; /&gt;

===Personal life===
Blanco's first husband was Carlos Trujillo. Together they had three sons, Dixon, Uber, and Osvaldo,&lt;ref name=&quot;maxim&quot; /&gt; all of them illiterate,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lathem, Niles&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Post|title=QUEENS NOW RULE WHERE KINGPINS ONCE REIGNED: WOMEN ARE RUNNING DRUG RINGS AFTER FALL OF COLOMBIAN CARTELS|author=Lathem, Niles|date=June 8, 2000|url= http://nypost.com/2000/06/08/queens-now-rule-where-kingpins-once-reigned-women-are-running-drug-rings-after-fall-of-colombian-cartels/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all of whom were killed in Colombia after being deported following prison sentences in the United States.&lt;ref name=MNT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvarado|first=Francisco|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2011-10-13/news/michael-corleone-blanco-lives-in-the-shadow-of-his-cocaine-queen-mother|date=October 13, 2011|title=Michael Corleone Blanco lives in the shadow of his cocaine-queen mother|journal=Miami New Times|accessdate= September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second husband was Alberto Bravo. In 1975, Blanco confronted Bravo, who was also her business partner, in a Bogotá nightclub parking lot about millions of dollars missing from the profits of the cartel they'd built together. ''The Guardian'' reports: &quot;Blanco, then 32, pulled out a pistol, Bravo responded by producing an Uzi submachine gun and after a blazing gun battle he and six bodyguards lay dead. Blanco, who suffered only a minor gunshot wound to the stomach, recovered and soon afterwards moved to Miami, where her body count – and reputation for ruthlessness – continued to climb.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Luscombe, Richard&quot;/&gt;

Blanco had her youngest son, Michael Corleone Blanco, with her third husband, Darío Sepúlveda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luscombe, Richard&quot;/&gt;  Sepúlveda  left her in 1983, returned to Colombia, and kidnapped Michael when he and Blanco disagreed over who would take custody. Blanco paid to have Sepúlveda assassinated in Colombia, and her son returned to her in Miami.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNT&quot;/&gt;

According to the ''[[Miami New Times]]'', &quot;Michael's father and older siblings were all killed before he reached adulthood. His mom was in prison for most of his childhood and teenage years, and he was raised by his maternal grandmother and legal guardians.&quot;&lt;ref name=MNT /&gt; In 2012, Michael, was put under house arrest after a May arrest on two felony counts of cocaine trafficking and conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvarado|first=Francisco|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2012/09/michael_corleone_blanco_grisel.php|date=Sep 5, 2012|title=Griselda Blanco's Son Michael Corleone Still Faces Cocaine Trafficking Charge in Miami|journal=Miami New Times|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanco was openly [[bisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Substance Abuse in America: A Documentary and Reference Guide|author=Swartz, James A.|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mistresses of mayhem: the book of women criminals|author=Hornberger, Francine |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mammoth Book of Gangs|author=Morton, James }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Post'',  &quot;Court records show Blanco was a drug addict who consumed vast quantities of 'bazooka,' a potent form of smokeable, unrefined cocaine,&quot; &quot;would force men and women to have sex at gunpoint, and had frequent bisexual orgies.&quot; Her &quot;favorite possessions included an emerald and gold [[MAC 10]] machine pistol, [[Eva Peron]]’s pearls and a tea set once used by the Queen of England.&quot; The report continues: &quot;In court, it was revealed that Blanco killed three former husbands as well as strippers, business rivals – and innocent bystanders, including a 4-year-old boy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lathem, Niles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Luscombe, Richard&quot;/&gt;

===Health===
In the late 1980s, her lifestyle caught up to her: &quot;Blanco - bloated, out of her wits and in poor health from decades of debauchery – turned over day-to-day management of her business to three of her illiterate sons, and tried to retire to suburban Irvine, Calif.&quot; In June 2002, the 56-year-old was in &quot;frail health and had already had one heart attack while in prison.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lathem, Niles&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
On the night of September 3, 2012, Blanco died after having been shot twice in the head by a motorcyclist, in a drive-by shooting in Medellín, Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/godmother-cocaine-shot-dead-colombia |title='Godmother of cocaine' shot dead in Colombia |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Luscombe |date=September 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was shot at Cardiso butcher shop on the corner of 29th Street, after having bought $150 worth of meat; the middle-aged gunman climbed off the back of a motorbike outside the shop, entered, pulled out a gun, and shot Blanco twice in the head before calmly walking back to his bike and disappearing into the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1942452.html#storylink=cpy|work=Miami Herald|date=September 5, 2012|title= The life and death of 'cocaine godmother' Griselda Blanco|authors=Robles, Frances &amp; Bargent, James }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was 69.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luscombe, Richard&quot;/&gt;

{{Puerto Rican Nationalist Party}}
'''Griselio Torresola''' (1925 &amp;ndash; November 1, 1950) born in [[Jayuya, Puerto Rico]], was one of two [[Puerto Rican nationalism|Puerto Rican nationalist]]s from New York City who attempted to assassinate [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Harry Truman]] on November 1, 1950. Torresola mortally wounded [[White House Police Force|White House police]]man Private [[Leslie Coffelt]] and wounded two other law enforcement officers. Torresola was killed by a return shot from Coffelt.

== Early life and political background ==
Torresola was born in Jayuya, Puerto Rico. His family believed in the Puerto Rican independence cause. They had participated in many of the island's past revolts. At the age of 23 Torresola moved to [[New York City]] in August 1948 to gain work. He was employed by a New York stationery and perfume store. Affected by a divorce from his first wife, he lost his job. A member of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]], Torresola joined the New York City chapter of the party, where he met fellow Nationalist [[Oscar Collazo]].

He remarried and lived with his new wife and two children on a welfare check of $125 a month.

==Jayuya Uprising==
Nationalists had been angered by what they viewed as great injustices during previous decades, including the [[Ponce Massacre]] (1937), the extrajudicial murders of some members, and the jailing of [[Pedro Albizu Campos]], president of the Nationalist Party, for his advocacy of violent resistance. They felt the impending changes of Puerto Rico's status from a non-autonomous territory to a partially self-governing [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] were a continuation of United States imperialism. They viewed [[Puerto Rico]] as a [[colony]] demanding independence from the United States.

On October 30, 1950, Torresola's brother and sister participated in the [[Jayuya Uprising]], part of insurgent efforts across Puerto Rico by Nationalists. They attacked police headquarters and other facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRK&quot;&gt;&quot;Puerto Rico&quot; By Kurt Pitzer, Tara Stevens, page 224, Hunter Publishing, Inc, 2001, ISBN 1-58843-116-9, ISBN 978-1-58843-116-5&lt;/ref&gt; The island government declared [[martial law]] and attacked the town with U.S. [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] strike fighter planes, land-based artillery, mortar fire, grenades, and the Puerto Rican National Guard. The planes machine-gunned nearly every rooftop in the town. The Nationalists held the town for two days; after they were overcome, the government made mass arrests. In New York City, Torresola was angered by the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRK&quot;/&gt; He later learned that an extensive part of his hometown was destroyed, but the scale of military response was not reported outside of Puerto Rico. The American media reported President Truman as saying it was an &quot;incident between Puerto Ricans.&quot; Torresola learned that his sister was wounded and his brother arrested in the uprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRK&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Blair House daylight.jpg|thumb|240px|Blair House, site of the attempt, as it is today.&lt;br&gt;At the time of the attempt there were two guard booths out front.]]
Together Torresola and Collazo decided they needed to act quickly to bring the cause of independence to world attention. Having learned that President Truman was living at [[Blair House]] while the White House was being renovated, they thought security would be less. They decided to assassinate him to gain publicity for their cause. 

The two men took the train from New York south to Washington, DC. On November 1, 1950, they approached Blair House. Torresola walked up Pennsylvania Avenue from the west side while his partner, Oscar Collazo, engaged [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] special agents and [[White House Police Force|White House police]]men from the east. Torresola approached a guard booth at the west corner of the Blair house, and noted an officer, sitting inside. Torresola quickly fired four shots from his 9&amp;nbsp;mm German [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]], semi-automatic pistol at close range at [[Leslie Coffelt]]. Three of the shots struck Coffelt in the chest and abdomen, and the fourth went through his policeman's tunic. Coffelt slumped down in his chair, mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nylatinojournal.com/home/puerto_rico_x/history/puerto_rico_s_october_revolution.html &quot;Puerto Rico’s October Revolution&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826152927/http://nylatinojournal.com/home/puerto_rico_x/history/puerto_rico_s_october_revolution.html |date=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TL&quot;&gt;[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/trivia/assassin.htm Truman Library], Truman Library website&lt;/ref&gt;

Torresola saw that a plainclothes White House policeman had turned back toward him. Torresola shot him in the hip before he could draw his weapon, and twice more. Joseph Downs reached the basement door and went through, locking it to prevent Torresola from entering. The latter turned to a firefight between Collazo and several law enforcement men. officers. Torresola shot District of Columbia policeman Donald Birdzell in the left knee from a distance of approximately 40 feet, preventing him from shooting Collazo.&lt;ref name=&quot;TL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;P&quot;&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/lcoffelt.htm Arlington National Cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing to the left of the Blair House steps as he reloaded, Torresola was only 30 feet from President Truman, who had awakened by the gunfire and looked outside.  Agents yelled at him to get away from the window. The dying officer Coffelt struggled outside the guard booth and shot Torresola in the head, killing him instantly.

Coffelt died of his three bullet wounds several hours later. The overall gunfight lasted less than 40 seconds. Torresola was survived by his wife and two children.&lt;ref name=&quot;TL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;P&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Oscar Collazo survived his wound, was convicted at trial of murder, and sentenced to death. President Truman commuted his sentence to life. After serving 27 years in Leavenworth Federal Prison in Kansas, Collazo had his sentence commuted to time served by President Jimmy Carter; he was released in 1979.  He returned to Puerto Rico where he continued to support the independence movement.  He died in 1994, aged 80. Collazo is quoted as saying, &quot;It would not be justice to Griselio if we merely remembered him for his ability with weapons. We must remember the brave and expert guerrilla of the mountains of [[Jayuya]] as the patriot who never had doubts when his country called him to completion of his duty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TL&quot;/&gt;

==Plot==
Professional assassin Martin Blank finds himself depressed and bored with his work. A major problem is his chief rival Grocer, whose effort to cartelize the hitman business puts him at potentially lethal odds as he is unaffiliated. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in his hometown of [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan]]. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his therapist, Dr. Oatman, and his secretary, Marcella. She books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to smooth things over with the client whose contract was botched.

Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin reconnects with his childhood friend Paul and seeks out his high school sweetheart Debi Newberry, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets.

Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store that stands in place of his childhood home. He is also pursued by two [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer. Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to woo Debi and fails to open the background dossier on his prospective target.

At the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her toddler. Martin then experiences an epiphany, recognizing that his recent disillusionment with his work and his amends with Debi signify an opportunity to change his life for good. Moments later, while exploring the halls, Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self-defense. Debi stumbles upon the scene and, horrified to find that Martin was not joking about his work after all, flees the reunion. Paul arrives only moments later to find Martin, who coerces him into helping dispose of LaPoubelle's body in the school furnace. Realizing that his friend was not joking about his profession, Paul has a drink and leaves the dance.

Later Debi confronts Martin in his hotel room, where he reveals that psychological testing in the army showed he was suited to work as a hitman for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]; after leaving the CIA, he went into business for himself. His rationalizations for his work only scare Debi even more; she rejects his attempts at reconciliation and storms out. Martin, concluding that it is futile to try to change his life, fires his psychiatrist over the phone, notifies Marcella that he is laying her off (but directs her to a brick of cash hidden in the office, set aside for her severance pay) and finally opens the dossier containing the details of the contract that brought him to Grosse Pointe. He is startled to find that the target is Debi's father, Bart, who is scheduled to testify against Martin's client.

Grocer decides to kill Bart himself to impress Martin's client. Martin abandons the contract and rescues Bart from certain death, driving him to the Newberry house and holing up inside, narrowly ahead of Grocer and his mercenaries. During the siege, Martin finally reveals that he stood Debi up on prom night to enlist in the army to protect her from his homicidal urges. Martin gradually kills the team of mercenaries. The NSA agents are gunned down by Grocer and Martin. By this point, Martin has run out of ammunition, and when Grocer tries to trick him into &quot;selling&quot; him a weapon for $100,000, Martin kills him by crushing his head with a television. Injured and winded, Martin proposes marriage to Debi, who, shell-shocked from the day's events, does not respond. In the end, Debi and Martin leave Grosse Pointe together.

==Production==
Screenwriter [[Tom Jankiewicz]] wrote the initial script for ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' in 1991 after receiving an invitation to his 10th high school reunion.&lt;ref name=ivdb&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Allen |title=Upland screenwriter hit bull's-eye with 'Grosse Pointe' |url=http://www.dailybulletin.com/davidallen/ci_22505971/upland-screenwriter-hit-bulls-eye-grosse-pointe |work= [[Inland Valley Daily Bulletin]]  |publisher= |date=2013-02-02 |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He picked the title while substitute teaching for an English class at [[Upland High School]], writing the title on the classroom's whiteboard to see how it would look on a movie-theater marquee.&lt;ref name=ivdb/&gt; Jankiewicz decided to use [[Grosse Pointe]], an upscale [[suburb]] of [[Detroit, Michigan]], rather than his working-class hometown of [[Sterling Heights]] due to the contrast between the two towns.&lt;ref name=ivdb/&gt;

Jankiewicz simultaneously worked as a substitute teacher and a [[cashier]] at a [[Big Lots]] in [[Upland, California]], to make ends meet before his script was picked up for production.&lt;ref name=ivdb/&gt;

Jankiewicz, who was raised in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]], based many of the film's characters on his real-life friends from [[Bishop Foley Catholic High School]] in [[Madison Heights, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=dfp&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie|last=Hinds|title='Grosse Pointe Blank' writer Tom Jankiewicz found a place in film history |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130201/ENT01/302010019/-Grosse-Pointe-Blank-writer-Tom-Jankiewicz-found-a-place-in-film-history?odyssey=nav%7chead |work= [[Detroit Free Press]]  |publisher= |date=2013-02-02 |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Jeremy Piven]]'s character, Paul Spericki, was originally named after Jankiewicz's best friend during high school, though the name was changed during filming.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;  It was rumored that the film's script was based on an actual high school student from Jankiewicz's past who became a professional [[hit man]], which is untrue.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt; [[Joan Cusack]]'s character, Marcella, was named for Jankiewicz's manager at [[Big Lots]].&lt;ref name=ivdb/&gt;

George Armitage later claimed &quot;I did as much as anyone did in terms of writing&quot; but did not seek credit.
:The script, when I met with John [Cusack] and the writers, was 132 pages. I said: “Look, I’m not doing anything over 100 pages.” They said, “Okay,” and they did a re-write, and it came back 150 pages. So I said “Okay, you guys are fired,” and I spent most of pre-production re-writing the screenplay, getting it down to 102 pages. Then we would improvise, and I noticed that some of the stuff I’d cut out was in the improvs, they were bringing back stuff that I’d cut out, but we had a good time with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;film&quot;&gt;[http://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-george-armitage/ Nick Pinkerton, &quot;Interview with George Armitage&quot;, ''Film Comment'' 28 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Anchor|Locations}}
Only the aerial footage of Lakeshore Drive was actually shot in Grosse Pointe.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt; The city of Grosse Pointe Farms did not allow the filmmakers to use any shots of [[Grosse Pointe South High School]] for the movie due to the presence of alcohol in the reunion scenes. The majority of the film was shot in [[Monrovia, California]].&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt; In a 1997 interview, actor John Cusack, who shares the film's screenwriting credit along with Jankiewicz, [[Steve Pink]], and [[D.V. DeVincentis]], said he would have liked to film on location in Grosse Pointe, but they were unable to move production to Michigan due to budget constraints.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;

The scene where Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle while exploring the halls of his old high school was filmed at [[Reseda High School]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]].

Armitage later recalled:
:With ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' I shot three movies simultaneously. We shot the script as written, we shot a mildly understated version, and we shot a completely over-the-top version, which usually was what was used. We cast that movie—and I’ve cast most movies—by having the actors come in and read, then throwing the script out and saying: “Okay, let’s improvise.” That’s what I was comfortable with. I say to the actors: “You are creating the character. This is written, these are the parameters, this is the outline. Now you take this, make it your own, and bring me, bring me, bring me.”... I’m very fond of ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' because of that, the insanity of it was trying to keep things working with three different registers to choose from.&lt;ref name=&quot;film&quot;/&gt;
Armitage says he shot several endings:
:I’m usually rather rough on studio heads in terms of creative help, but after seeing the audience so angry at Alec dying in ''Miami Blues'', I decided that on ''Grosse Pointe Blank'', this time, dealing with another psychopath, another sociopath, John’s character—I just wanted him to survive. And we shot so many different endings. They were so generous at Disney, we had Ovitz and Joe Roth were running the place, they were really great with us. We shot two or three different endings, the two of them getting together, talking about things, and everything didn’t work. And Joe Roth said at one of the screenings: “When the father says ‘You’ve got my blessing’ in the bathtub at the end, after the shoot-out, just cut to the two of them leaving.” I thought, “Let’s give it a shot,” and it worked beautifully.&lt;ref name=&quot;film&quot;/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
''Grosse Pointe Blank'' received positive reviews from critics.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4. He praised the chemistry between the lead actors and enjoyed the dialogue, but considered it a near-miss, wishing for a wittier, more clever ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Roger | last=Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert | title=Grosse Pointe Blank | date=April 11, 1997 | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970411/REVIEWS/704110302/1023 | publisher=[[Chicago Sun Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score for ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' was composed by [[Joe Strummer]], formerly of [[The Clash]], and the soundtrack includes two songs from The Clash: &quot;[[Rudie Can't Fail]]&quot; and their [[cover version]] of [[Willi Williams]]' &quot;[[Armagideon Time]]&quot;.

In addition to The Clash, the tracks featured in the film are largely a mix of popular and alternative 1980s [[punk rock]], [[ska]], and [[New wave music|new wave]] from such bands as [[Violent Femmes]], [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]], [[The Specials]], [[The Jam]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[A-ha]]. While most songs played throughout the film (especially at the reunion) had been recorded by the time of the students' graduation in  1986, several songs were recorded later:

* The [[Guns N' Roses]] version of [[Paul McCartney]]'s &quot;[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]],&quot; heard in the scene where Martin first visits the Ultimart, was released in 1991.
* [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]]' &quot;[[Matador (Los Fabulosos Cadillacs song)|Matador]],&quot; heard during the dance scene at the reunion, was released in 1993.
* The Specials' version of &quot;[[Pressure Drop (song)|Pressure Drop]],&quot; played by Debi at the radio station during her &quot;'80s weekend,&quot; was released in 1996.
* [[Eels (band)|Eels]]' &quot;[[Your Lucky Day in Hell]],&quot; heard when Martin and Debi visit the Hippo Club for drinks, was also released in 1996.

The soundtrack album reached #31 on the [[Billboard 200]] chart, prompting the release of a second volume of songs from the film.

'''Gríma''', called (the) '''Wormtongue''', is a fictional character in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He appears in the second and third volumes of the work, ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King]]'', and his role is expanded upon in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. He is introduced in ''The Two Towers'' as the chief advisor to King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and henchman of [[Saruman]].  Gríma serves as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[sycophant]], flatterer, liar, and manipulator, and is considered to be based by Tolkien on the [[Beowulf]] character [[Unferth]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Allard, ''Beowulf and Other Stories'' (2014) p. 45-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Gríma'' derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] or [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word meaning &quot;mask&quot;, &quot;helmet&quot; or &quot;spectre&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halfdan.is/vestur/nofn.htm#grím&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/017508|title=gríma|work=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] (Online) | author=Bosworth, Joseph | authorlink=Joseph Bosworth |author2=Toller, T. Northcote | location=Prague | publisher=[[Charles University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to link the name to the English word &quot;grim&quot;, which among other characteristics means &quot;ugly&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/009520|title=EORL|work=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] (Online) | author=Bosworth, Joseph | authorlink=Joseph Bosworth |author2=Toller, T. Northcote | location=Prague | publisher=[[Charles University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Old English language|Old English]].

== Appearances ==

=== ''The Two Towers'' ===

Gríma, son of Gálmód, was at first a faithful servant, but he eventually fell in league with [[Saruman]], and from then on worked to weaken Théoden and his kingdom through lies and persuasion.

Tolkien describes him as &quot;a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face, and heavy lidded eyes&quot;, with a &quot;long pale tongue&quot;.

He was widely disliked in [[Edoras]]; everyone except [[Théoden]] called him &quot;Wormtongue&quot;. [[Gandalf]] repeatedly compares him to a snake:{{quote|text=The wise speak only of what they know, Gríma son of Gálmód. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a serving-man till the lightning falls.|sign=Gandalf|source=''The Two Towers''}}

{{quote|text=See, Théoden, here is a snake! To slay it would be just. But it was not always as it now is. Once it was a man, and it did you service in its fashion.|sign=Gandalf|source=''The Two Towers''}}

It is implied that Saruman had promised him [[Éowyn]], the king's niece, as a reward for his services. Her brother [[Éomer]] accused him of &quot;watching her under his lids and haunting her steps&quot;. His schemes were foiled when Gandalf the White and his companions arrived at Edoras, and convinced the king that he was not as weak as his adviser had made him seem. Upon Théoden's restoration, &quot;many things which men had missed&quot; were found locked in Gríma's trunk, including the king's sword, [[Herugrim]]. Théoden decided to go forth to battle at the [[Fords of Isen]], and Gríma was given a choice: prove his loyalty and ride into battle with the king, or ride into exile. Choosing the latter, he went to Saruman at [[Orthanc]]. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, Gríma mistakenly threw the ''[[palantír]]'' of [[Orthanc]] at the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)#People|Rohirrim]] accompanying Gandalf, or possibly at Saruman himself, and so permitted its capture by [[Peregrin Took]].

=== ''The Return of the King'' ===

Gríma accompanied Saruman to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], where Saruman sought revenge for his defeat at Orthanc in petty tyranny over the [[Hobbit]]s. During this time, Saruman shortened Gríma's nickname to &quot;Worm&quot;. When Saruman was overthrown by a hobbit rebellion and ordered to leave, [[Frodo Baggins]] implored Gríma not to follow him, and even offered him food and shelter. Saruman countered by revealing to the Hobbits that Gríma had murdered and possibly eaten [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]], a kinsman of Frodo; whereupon Gríma killed Saruman and was shot by Hobbit archers.

=== ''Unfinished Tales'' ===

Gríma played a major role in the back-story to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', prior to his first appearance in ''The Two Towers''. In ''Unfinished Tales'' Tolkien writes that on the 20th of September in {{ME-date|TA|3018}} Gríma was captured by the [[Nazgûl]] in the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|fields of the Rohirrim]], while on his way to [[Isengard]] to inform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at [[Edoras]]. He divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazgûl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Gríma was set free, and the Nazgûl set out immediately for the Shire. In another version within the same chapter, this role is given to the ''squint-eyed southerner'' that the hobbits encounter at [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|UT|The Hunt for the Ring pg 340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same book, Tolkien intimates that Gríma may have given Théoden &quot;subtle poisons&quot; that caused him to age at an accelerated pace.

== Adaptations ==

=== Films ===

[[File:BakshiGríma.JPG|left|thumb|220px|Gríma, as portrayed in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'']]

In [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 animated film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', Gríma Wormtongue was voiced by [[Michael Deacon]] (and his name is pronounced &quot;Grime-a&quot;).

[[Paul Brooke]] played Gríma in [[BBC Radio]]'s 1981 [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|serialisation]].

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' films, Gríma was played by [[Brad Dourif]]. According to Dourif, Jackson encouraged him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience would immediately have a [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] reaction of unease to the character.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.west-of-the-moon.net/bradhour.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103033455/http://www.west-of-the-moon.net/bradhour.htm |date=January 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[The Scouring of the Shire]]&quot; episode does not appear in the film version; the deaths of Saruman and Gríma were moved to an earlier scene, &quot;The Voice of Saruman&quot;.  This scene was cut from the theatrical releases of the films, but can be found on the Extended Edition [[DVD]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.

[[File:Grima and Théoden.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Wormtongue (left) as portrayed by [[Brad Dourif]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]

In this scene, the assembled leaders of the West ride to [[Ent]]-occupied [[Isengard]] to confront [[Saruman]].  Théoden offers Gríma [[clemency]], but when he tries to accept, Saruman curses him and knocks him down. Enraged, Gríma stabs Saruman in the back. Saruman then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, remnant of his war machines, and the ''[[palantír]]'' slips out of his cloak. Gríma himself is shot and killed by one of [[Legolas]]' arrows. In the DVD commentary, Jackson states that in further deleted material Saruman reveals to the company that Gríma had killed [[Théoden]]'s son [[Théodred]], casting new light on both his earlier reaction to Théodred's death and on Legolas' reason for shooting him.

'''Gu Kailai''' (born 15 November 1958) is a Chinese former lawyer and businesswoman. She is the second wife of former [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] member [[Bo Xilai]], one of China's most influential politicians until he was stripped of his offices in 2012. In August 2012, Gu was convicted of murdering British businessman [[Neil Heywood]] and was given a [[Death sentence with reprieve|suspended death sentence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 20&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19312232 | title=Bo Xilai scandal: Gu Kailai jailed over Heywood murder | publisher=BBC | date=19 August 2012 | accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AJ 20&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2012/08/201282011725257481.html | title=Chinese politician's wife convicted of murder | publisher=Al Jazeera | date=20 August 2012 | accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 20&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/20/us-china-trial-idUSBRE87J01W20120820 | title=China's Gu Kailai gets suspended death sentence | agency=Reuters | date=20 August 2012 | accessdate=20 August 2012 | author=Ruwitch, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family ==
Gu is the youngest of five daughters of General [[Gu Jingsheng]], a prominent revolutionary in the years before the Chinese Communist Party took power.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg News (13 April 2012). [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-13/china-murder-suspect-s-sisters-ran-126-million-business-empire &quot;China Murder Suspect’s Sisters Ran $126 Million Empire&quot;]. ''Bloomberg BusinessWeek''. Retrieved 20 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; General Gu held various government positions during early Communist rule but was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. Gu Kailai herself was also punished, being forced to work in a butcher shop and a textile factory.

Gu met Bo Xilai in 1984 while on a field trip looking into environmental art in [[Jinzhou District|Jin County, Liaoning]], where he was the Communist Party secretary. The couple have one son, [[Bo Guagua|Bo Kuangyi]], known as Guagua,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1312577/bo-xilai-jail-letter-my-name-will-be-cleared-one-day|title=Bo Xilai jail letter: My name will be cleared one day|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; who studied at [[Harrow School]], [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and Harvard's [[Kennedy School of Government]].&lt;ref name=jp&gt;Jeremy Page, [https://www.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904491704576572552793150470.html &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot;], ''The Wall Street Journal''. 26 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gu Kailai gained a degree in law and then a masters in international politics from [[Peking University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17672680 China's 'Jackie Kennedy' under scrutiny], BBC News, 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to become an accomplished lawyer founding the Kailai law firm in Beijing.&lt;ref name=WCT&gt;[http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120319000101&amp;cid=1601 Wife of sacked Chongqing boss a woman of many talents], ''Want China Times'', 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of her career, she was involved in several high-profile cases, and is suggested to have been the first Chinese lawyer to win a civil suit in the United States, where she represented several Dalian-area companies involved in a dispute in [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;Jeremy Page, [https://www.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304177104577303740612604260.html?mod=googlenews_wsj  U.K. Seeks Probe Into China Death], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the author of several books.

==Views on justice systems==
After visiting the United States, Kailai ridiculed the U.S. justice system as inept, writing &quot;They can level charges against dogs and a court can even convict a husband of raping his wife,&quot; she wrote. Gu wrote that, &quot;We don't play with words and we adhere to the principle of 'based on facts,'...You will be arrested, sentenced and executed as long as we determine that you killed someone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cn.nytimes.com/article/china/2012/08/10/c10hefei/en/|title=谷开来案凸显中国司法制度缺陷 |trans_title=Gu Kailai case exposes faults in Chinese judicial system|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder investigation==

In March 2012, Gu became embroiled in a national scandal after her husband's deputy, Wang Lijun, [[Wang Lijun incident|sought refuge at the U.S. consulate]] in Chengdu. It was rumored that Wang presented evidence of a corruption scandal, whereby Bo sought to impede a corruption investigation against Gu.&lt;ref name=death20120326smh&gt;John Garnaut, [http://www.smh.com.au/world/bo-intrigue-deepens-over--death-of--briton-20120326-1vt6y.html 'Bo intrigue deepens over death of Briton'], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Wang stated that Gu had been involved in a business dispute with British businessman Neil Heywood, who died in Chongqing under disputed circumstances; Wang alleged he had been poisoned. ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that Wang may have fallen out of favor with Bo for discussing the Heywood case.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Page, Brian Spegele, and Steve Eder, [https://www.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303299604577327472813686432.html 'Jackie Kennedy of China' at Center of Political Drama], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following the Wang Lijun incident and Bo's removal from key Communist Party posts, Gu was placed under investigation for Heywood's death.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;Chris Buckley and Benjamin Kang Lim, [http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/10/us-china-politics-bo-idUSBRE8390KT20120410 &quot;China says Bo Xilai's wife suspected of murder China suspends Bo from elite ranks, wife suspected of murder&quot;], Reuters, 10 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 April 2012, Gu was detained and &quot;transferred to the judicial authorities&quot; as part of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Bristow |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17668376|title=Bo Xilai's wife suspected over 'murder' of Briton|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 April 2012|date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an unusual move, state media appended her husband's surname in front of her own (rendering her name as Bo Gu Kailai), extremely unusual for married women in People's Republic of China, without any explanation. Some speculate that it may imply that Gu may have acquired citizenship of a foreign country, and as a result &quot;Bo Gu Kailai&quot; appeared on her official documents;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sharon LaFraniere|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/world/asia/surname-of-bo-xilais-wife-adds-to-chinese-mystery.html|title=Surname of Ex-Official's Wife Adds New Twist to Mystery|work=The New York Times|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that this is because authorities wanted to emphasize that Gu's alleged crimes were linked to misconduct by her husband.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/Key-Chinese-Official-Removed-for-Scandal-146962025.html |title=Bo Xilai Scandal Dominates Chinese Media |first=Stephanie |last=Ho |publisher=Voice of America |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413172633/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/Key-Chinese-Official-Removed-for-Scandal-146962025.html |archivedate=13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and verdict===
On 26 July 2012, Gu was formally charged with murdering Heywood, based on what the prosecutor claimed was &quot;irrefutable and substantial&quot; evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/gu-kailai-charged-murder-china|title=Gu Kailai charged with murder of British businessman in China|date= 26 July 2012 | location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_826358.html|title=Bo Xilai's wife prosecuted for intentional homicide: Xinhua|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-07/26/c_131741188.htm Bogu Kailai, Zhang Xiaojun charged with intentional homicide], Xinhua News Agency, 26 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2012, according to the official [[Xinhua News Agency]], Gu admitted during a one-day trial that she was responsible for Heywood's murder. She claimed that her actions were due to a &quot;mental breakdown&quot;, and stated that she would &quot;accept and calmly face any sentence&quot;.&lt;ref name=BBCtrial&gt;{{cite news|title=Bo Xilai scandal: Gu Kailai 'admits Neil Heywood murder'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19211728|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 August 2012|date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gu kailai.jpg|thumb|Speculation of body double: Gu at her trial (left); earlier public image of Gu (right)]]On 20 August 2012, Gu received a [[Death sentence with reprieve|suspended death sentence]], which is normally commuted to a life sentence after two years, but she could be released on medical parole after serving nine years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443713704577600990316850180.html|title=China's Gu May Spend Only 9 Years in Prison|author=Jeremy Page|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 August 2012|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial lasted one day, and Gu did not contest her charges. Zhang Xiaojun, a Bo family aide, was sentenced to nine years in jail for his involvement in the murder following his confession.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AJ 20&quot;/&gt;

After the media published footage of the trial, claims that the woman shown in court was not in fact Gu, but a [[body double]], quickly became popular on Chinese Internet fora, and Chinese authorities attempted to censor them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secretchina.com/news/12/08/13/462769.html?%E5%A7%9C%E7%BB%B4%E5%B9%B3%EF%BC%9A%E5%BA%AD%E5%AE%A1%E7%9A%84%E8%B0%B7%E5%BC%80%E6%9D%A5%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E6%9B%BF%E8%BA%AB%28%E5%9B%BE%29|title=姜维平：庭审的谷开来不是替身(图)|work=Secret China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts did not agree: the ''[[Financial Times]]'' cited &quot;security experts familiar with facial recognition software&quot; that the person who stood trial was not Gu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19357107|title=Gu Kailai and the body double debate|author=Yuwen Wu|publisher=BBC News|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathrin Hille, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/23650754-e9b3-11e1-b011-00144feab49a.html Gu Kailai verdict set for Monday], ''Financial Times'', 19 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a facial recognition expert contacted by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' was of the opinion that the woman most likely was Gu. The practice of rich people paying others to stand trial and receive punishment in their place, called ''[[ding zui]]'', is relatively widespread in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sant|first=Geoffrey|title=Double Trouble in China|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2012/08/gu_kailai_trial_chinese_netizens_believe_that_bo_xilai_s_wife_has_hired_a_body_double_to_represent_her_in_court_and_possibly_serve_her_time_in_prison_.single.html|accessdate=25 August 2012|newspaper=Slate|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the verdict, the United Kingdom announced that it welcomed the investigation, and said that they &quot;consistently made clear to the Chinese authorities that we wanted to see the trials in this case conform to international human rights standards and for the death penalty not to be applied.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 20&quot;/&gt; [[BBC News]] commented that &quot;informed observers see the fingerprints of the Communist Party of China all over this outcome&quot;, stating that the trial's conclusion was &quot;all too neat and uncannily suited to one particular agenda&quot;, that of limiting the scandal's damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19314925|title=Bo Xilai casts long shadow over Gu Kailai case|first=John|last=Sudworth|date=20 August 2012|publisher=BBC News|archivedate=20 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A3RCwDjH|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested the verdict &quot;raised questions about official corruption and political favoritism within the Communist Party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/world/asia/in-china-gu-kailais-reprieve-reinforces-cynicism.html?hp |title=In China, Gu Kailai's Reprieve Reinforces Cynicism|date=21 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Andrew|last=Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, Neil Heywood was murdered because he demanded $22&amp;nbsp;million from Gu after a real estate venture failed, and after Heywood sent an email which threatened her son, Gu decided to neutralise the threat. At a hotel in Chongqing, Gu gave Heywood whiskey and tea. Heywood became drunk and vomited. When he tried to go to bed, Gu poured animal poison into his mouth and she placed pills next to him to make it appear as though he had overdosed on drugs.&lt;ref name=nfir&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs |first=Andrew |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/world/asia/china-defers-death-penalty-for-gu-kailai.html |title=China Defers Death Penalty for Disgraced Official's Wife |work=The New York Times |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Reuters, at the end of 2011, Gu asked Heywood to move a large amount of money out of China.&lt;ref name=rfir&gt;{{cite news|last=Buckley |first=Chris |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/us-china-leader-murder-idUSBRE83G03U20120417 |title=Briton killed after threat to expose Chinese leader's wife |agency=Reuters |date=17 April 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heywood agreed to do that if Gu paid him a certain amount of money. But Heywood asked for a larger cut of the money than Gu expected. When Gu told Heywood he was being greedy, Heywood threatened to expose what Gu was doing. Gu was outraged and decided to kill Heywood.&lt;ref name=rfir/&gt; An academic close to the Bo family said Wang Lijun had written two letters to the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] which accused Gu of moving several hundred million dollars out of the country. The CDIC did not act immediately but the letters increased pressure for a deep probe.&lt;ref name=nsec&gt;{{cite news|last=LaFraniere |first=Sharon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/world/asia/fund-transfer-cited-in-inquiry-on-death-of-briton-in-china.html |title=Briton in a Chinese Scandal Reportedly Brokered Overseas Money Transfers |work=The New York Times |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 2015, Gu Kailai's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. The prison authorities said Gu had expressed repentance and had made no intentional offences during their review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

The game allows players to alter the storyline through their actions, such as choosing between a number of [[Nonlinear gameplay|branching paths]], leading to [[multiple endings]], and killing civilians and enemies, leading to changes in the [[Alignment (role-playing games)|Karma meter]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Kalata, [http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/guardianheroes/guardianheroes.htm Guardian Heroes], Hardcore Gaming 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gameobserver.com/features/inside/all-platforms/top-20-scrollers-part-5--5-4-3-34/ Top 20 Scrollers (Part 5)], Game Observer&lt;/ref&gt; The music was composed by [[Hideki Matsutake]], a former member of [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and Nazo Suzuki.&lt;ref name=&quot;gspot_guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Guardian Heroes Tech Info| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| url=http://uk.gamespot.com/saturn/action/guardianheroes/tech_info.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018192840/http://uk.gamespot.com/guardian-heroes/techinfo/platform/saturn/| archivedate=October 18, 2012| accessdate = 2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is considered a [[Cult video game|cult classic]] of the beat 'em up genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpgamer.com/games/guardheroes/guardheroes/reviews/guardheroesstrev1.html RPGamer's Guardian Heroes Review], RPGamer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
In addition to story mode, the game includes a versus mode wherein up to six players can compete using any of the main characters (and unlockable monsters, bosses, and civilians) in a timed battle or to the death.

The players earn [[experience points]] during each scene, and between scenes are able to improve and customize their characters with six attributes: Strength (determines physical damage per hit and distance enemies fly when the player hits them), Vitality (determines [[Hit points|HP]]), Intelligence (governs size and strength of spells), Mentality (determines how many [[Magic point|MP]] the player has and how fast MP are recovered), Agility (determines the speed at which characters can do physical and magical attacks) and Luck (modifies damage the player gives and receives, in addition to improving Nicole's selection of spells).

The game's story mode has multiple paths. The player can choose where they will go and what they do after every level. Different paths lead to different endings, bosses, and levels.

The battlefield has multiple levels. Initially, the player can only access three planes of battle: a foreplane, a middle plane, and a back plane. These planes can be switched between in set sequence, or at the player's choosing based on which button is pressed. Often, evasive actions can be taken by switching a plane.

==Story==
A supreme being created the universe to find ultimate warriors to hire as its personal soldiers. A vicious battle was waged between the Earth and Sky Spirits (renamed the Earthblood and the Skyborn in the Xbox 360 Remix). The Sky Spirits bestowed incredible powers upon the humans, effectively making powerful wizards for their own gain. The human wizards joined the effort against the Earth Spirits, banishing them into the darkness. Soon after this was accomplished, the Sky Spirits grew fearful and jealous of the humans, and banished them all into the darkness with the Earth Spirits. Mankind instead opted for a more physical approach to life, and the Time of the Sword began.

One of the human wizards, Kanon, escapes his imprisonment with the Earth Spirits, and comes back to the surface to get his revenge on the Sky Spirits. There, he brings his case up with the existing khans. Since they do not trust him, he destroys them and replaces their kingdom with a wizard kingdom, with puppet khans to do his will. The former king prophesied, prior to his death, that should his reign and the Time of the Sword be brought to such an end, then the sword would resurface and in turn bring an end to Kanon's reign. As a precaution, Kanon banishes every existing sword in his new kingdom, but he overlooks one particular sword, belonging to a fierce, anonymous warrior who fought to the death during Kanon's takeover. Also, the former princess Serena survives the ordeal, and joins the band of knights to try to bring about Kanon's end from the inside.

At the game's start, four warriors – Han, Randy (with his pet rabbit, Nando), Nicole and Ginjirou – find the sword of the valiant warrior. Serena arrives to warn them that the knights have learned of their possession of the sword, and are coming to take it back. The four flee their home as it bursts up in flames during the invasion, then escape the town via separate ways, rendezvousing at the graveyard nearby.

The leader of the Black Knights, Valgar, awaits them there, accompanied by a powerful robotic warrior. They are unable to damage it with normal weapons, and Han resolves to use the new sword against the robot. The sword is struck by lightning, electrocuting Han and causing him to lose his grip on it. The sword then floats over to the burial mound of its original owner, who rises up in zombie form. Enraged, he obliterates Valgar's robot, and attacks Serena. However, the five discover that the warrior obeys any command that they give. They resolve that, with this new ally, the time to begin an attack on Kanon's new kingdom is at hand.

From here, the story splits into various paths. Some involve ultimately fighting against the Sky Spirits, Earth Spirits, and/or the supreme being that made the universe, while others wind up with the warriors ultimately defeating Kanon, only to have to defeat Super Zur, or various rogue robotic warriors that he had left behind, led by the nefarious Golden Silver.

==Characters==

===Playable characters===
*Samuel Han: Physically powerful, Han can inflict a lot of damage even against guarding opponents (as his tackle bypasses blocking), but his movements are slow, and he cannot use much magic. He also has a flaming attack, similar to Ginjirou's lightning attack. He jumps high in the air, ignites, and comes down in flames on his enemies. Though he is slow-moving at first, raising his Agility stat will correct this. Han starts the game wielding the sword of the Undead Hero, until it is reclaimed by its true owner. In one of the story arcs, he may acquire a similar sword which grants him the stat bonuses he originally had when wielding the Undead Sword.
*Randy M. Green: Randy has many spectacular attacks and a large variety of elemental magic, including fireballs, lightning bolts, pools of ice and a devastating laser-like heat ray. However, he suffers from low vitality. Randy's familiar, Nando, assists Randy during story mode, and is available as a playable character in Versus mode. In melee, Randy uses multi-hit attacks.
*Ginjirou Ibushi: Ginjirou has an emphasis on mobility. He has a large variety of moving attacks, but this can also work against him. He also has a number of lightning/thunder attacks. Though his attack power is weaker than Han's, the sheer number of hits he is capable of dealing to enemies makes him a formidable character, and his lightning attacks allow him to deliver more hits to any single target than any other character in the game, meaning he can rack up combo points very easily and gain levels just as quickly.
*Nicole Neil: Nicole has a smiley face emblem on her amulet and most of her magic attacks incorporate a smiley face. She is the only hero who can use healing magic, but as a drawback her attacks are the weakest of the four heroes. Her Barrier ability damages enemies until they are forced away from her; if an enemy cannot be forced away from Nicole (e.g. the Barrier pushes the enemy against the wall), then it suffers grievous wounds until the barrier wears off. If an enemy blocks the barrier attack and is standing against the wall, the barrier deals massive amounts of damage.
*Serena Corsair: Serena the Knight has a wide variety of moves and a good selection of magic spells, the majority of which revolve around cold and ice. The most powerful of these are her Angel Breath, which creates an umbrella-like field of ice particles around herself when used, protecting her from physical attacks and freezing anything close to her, and the Valkyrie Javelin, which is similar to Randy's Super Magic Fire Blaster, but freezes attackers instead of burning them. Serena joins the player as an NPC in story mode, but is later unlockable as a playable character. Kanon later reveals that Serena is actually the surviving heir of the murdered Khans, making her a legitimate contender for the throne. She is the only hidden character that can be played in story mode.

===Other characters===
*Undead Hero: A powerful warrior who died when the Khans were killed. His body returns to life when his sword is accidentally brought to his grave. The Undead Hero is a NPC who can be given simple directions by the players: Follow,  Wait, Attack, Defend, and Berserk. In the Xbox Remix version, Serena reveals that the Undead Hero was a brave warrior who protected her family.
*Kanon G. Gray: The leader of the kingdom, Kanon is an unparalleled spellcaster who also possesses flight and the ability to generate his own magic.
*Valgar Reinhart: The prince of the puppet kingdom and leader of the Black Knights. Valgar's fate varies dramatically in the plot arcs, with him either being killed by Zur, turned into a warrior of the Sky Gods, or him teaming up alongside the heroes to save Lucia from Golden Silver. In Versus mode, though he has a very simple moveset, his high agility and attack priority allow him to be played aggressively.
*Katrina: The head of the Royal Knights Red Group, Katrina vies to prove herself Serena's superior. She has an on/off romantic interest in Prince Valgar. In Versus mode, she is a clone of Serena.
*Gash Deadeye: The commander of the Blue Knights, Gash used to be a friendly rival of Han. Now that the Guardian Heroes are wanted by Kanon, Gash is forced to fight his former comrade-in-arms. In Versus mode, Gash functions identically to Han.
*Zur Pah Yah: A maniac who performs special missions for the royal family, Zur is only important in one plot arc in which he kills Valgar and absorbs his power, becoming Super Zur. Super Zur takes damage from healing magic. In Versus mode, Zur, who is incapable of blocking or crouching, can throw darts and run away from opponents. As Super Zur, in addition to his previous moveset, he can block as well as gaining a larger moveset (including the World Conquest Cannon) and the ability to regenerate health over time.
*Macho: Leader of the Muscle-Heads, a group of physically strong bandits. He mistakes the Undead Warrior as a golem of priceless value and is willing to use force to retrieve it. He is an opponent of Kanon and helps shelter Lucia in one of the story arcs. In Versus Mode, Macho is a powerful martial artist who uses comparatively more complex combos than his peers.
*Gambo: Macho's right-hand man, he is not as powerful by comparison but his special moves are easier to execute.
*Proto/Golden Silver: A series of mechanical constructs designed to carry out Kanon's will. There are multiple Proto Silvers, but only one Golden Silver unit, which serves as commander to Kanon's robotic minions. In the story arc where the players encounter him, Golden Silver becomes autonomous after Kanon's death and attempts to become ruler of the kingdom. In Versus mode, Proto Silver fights with electric blades, machine guns, flamethrowers, and a teleportation device. Golden Silver uses the same moveset of Proto Silver and additionally has four Force Gems which automatically attack enemies. Golden Silver is the same Golden Silver from ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'', and must be killed in the same manner.
*Xenovia/King Valgar: Unbeknownst to Kanon, King Valgar is actually Xenovia, leader of the Earth Spirits. Xenovia is dedicated to defeating the Sky Spirits so that the Earth Spirits may be freed from their imprisonment. If the players ally with Xenovia, the Sky God becomes the antagonist. In Versus mode, Xenovia is a [[succubus]]-like entity that fights using a variety of kicking and flying maneuvers, as well as limited thunder and fire magic.
*Sky Warrior: A representative of the Sky Spirits, this winged warrior fights using two identical swords. Sky Warrior has jumping and gliding abilities, and can summon thunder and tornadoes without requiring magic.
*Great Earth Spirit: The true form of Xenovia, appearing when the heroes choose to follow the will of the Sky Spirits and defeat the Earth Spirits.
*Sky Spirit: The true form of the Sky Warrior, it appears when the heroes ally themselves with the Earth Spirits. The Sky Spirit can fly and regenerate its magic.
*Celestial Being: This being designed the universe to endure endless conflict so that ultimate warriors might arise. It would then recruit these warriors to serve it. If the players choose to ally with the Sky God, the main characters are forced to wipe out the Earth Spirits, thus ensuring their place as ultimate warriors.
*Princess Lucia: The Princess of the puppet kingdom, and Valgar's sister. She learns of Kanon's plot and tries to escape the castle in the process.

==Development==
According to former [[Treasure (company)|Treasure]] designer [[Tetsuhiko Kikuchi|Tetsuhiko &quot;Han&quot; Kikuchi]], [[Fill-in-Cafe]]'s ''[[Mad Stalker: Full Metal Force (1994 video game)|Mad Stalker: Full Metal Force]]'' and [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Alien vs. Predator (arcade game)|Alien VS. Predator]]'' [[arcade game]] were the main inspirations for ''Guardian Heroes''' design.&lt;ref&gt;November 2012 issue of [[Nintendo Power]] magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why Treasure chose to develop a 2D sprite-based game when the video game sales were increasingly dominated by 3D games, and when nearly every other Saturn developer was concentrating strictly on 3D games, a Treasure representative commented, &quot;Treasure has built up a tremendous knowledge of 2D sprite know how. It's an asset that we wish to continue using. ... No we didn't think it was risky. In fact the risk is in trying to make a new game. There [are] a lot of companies that have tried and failed to make successful 3D games. Besides, 2D and 3D games can exist alongside each other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=The Treasure Interview|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=7 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=June 1996|pages=108–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[XBLA]] release, Tetsuhiko Kikuchi returned to create new artwork and assisted development.

==Xbox Live Arcade version==
On May 5, 2011, [[Sega of America]] and [[Sega Europe]] announced a remastered version of ''Guardian Heroes'' for [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for Fall 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gameplaytoday.com/home/news-archive/5280-sega-saturn-classic-guardian-heroes-announced-for-the-xbla/ |title= Sega Saturn Classic Guardian Heroes Announced for the XBLA |last1= Cox |first1= Austin |date= 5 May 2011 |website= Gameplay Today |publisher= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120323144724/http://www.gameplaytoday.com/home/news-archive/5280-sega-saturn-classic-guardian-heroes-announced-for-the-xbla/ |archivedate= 23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on September 6 that the game would be released on October 12.

The port makes numerous changes to the original. It has been reformatted for 16:9 [[aspect ratio]], expanding the playfield. The game features both original and &quot;remix&quot; graphics modes and runs in high definition with a remade [[user interface]] in both. The remix mode applies an [[hqx]]-like [[Image scaling|upscaling]] [[Filter (video)|filter]] along with a pencil-shade effect to the sprites, implements true [[alpha blending]], applies [[bilinear filtering]] to the backgrounds and features redrawn spell effects and character portraits.

Players can also choose between original and remix options for the gameplay. Remix mode makes many changes to the game's control and mechanics, but does not impact level design or content. Some of these changes, like the new attacking and dodging controls, air dashing, and air recoveries, were modeled after Treasure's own ''[[Bleach: The Blade of Fate]]'', a fighting game that likewise features elements of ''Guardian Heroes''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The script for Story Mode has been rewritten and contains updated dialogue as well as changes in name to the Earth and Sky Spirits, who are now known as the Earthblood and the Skyborn, respectively.

The XBLA release also features online play for the multiplayer modes, and an expanded competitive mode that allows for 12 players instead of six. Arcade Mode, an endless survival gauntlet, is a new addition.

==Reception==

The game was well received. The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' praised the game's combos, multiple paths, and inclusion of a versus mode.&lt;ref name=&quot;EGM83&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Guardian Heroes|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=83|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 1996|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rad Automatic of ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' also praised the multiple paths through the game, but expressed the most enthusiasm about the high difficulty and the three layers on which the action takes place. He concluded, &quot;Innovative, challenging, exciting and tough, ''Guardian Heroes'' is a classic in every way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SatMag8&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Automatic |first=Rad |title=Review: Guardian Heroes|journal=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=8|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=June 1996|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Scary Larry lambasted the game's long-winded dialogue and graphics, saying that &quot;these poor, simpering graphics have no place on a next-gen machine. Colorful doesn't always mean clean, and there are plenty of jagged edges, pixelated fighters, and breakup.&quot; Despite this, he gave the game a strong recommendation, describing it as the true successor to the [[Streets of Rage (series)|''Streets of Rage'']] and [[Golden Axe (series)|''Golden Axe'']] series. He elaborated that ''Guardian Heroes'' retains all the fun of Streets of Rage's beat 'em up action and enhances it with new additions like multihit combos, linking moves, and a branching storyline with multiple endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Guardian Heroes|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=94 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1996|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasuhiro Hunter of ''Maximum'' said that &quot;Treasure's first attempt at a next gen game combines everything they do best - frantic action and an in-depth storyline with great character design.&quot; He reported that the action and RPG elements are both easy enough that enthusiasts of either genre would find the game accessible. He also highly praised the game's replay value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Max7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter |first=Yasuhiro |title=Maximum Reviews: Guardian Heroes|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=7 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=June 1996|pages=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospective feedback on the game has continued to be positive. [[IGN]] staff writer Levi Buchanan ranked ''Guardian Heroes'' third in his list of the top Sega Saturn games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/29/top-10-sega-saturn-games | title = Top 10 SEGA Saturn Games | accessdate = 2013-04-03 | last = Buchanan | first = Levi | date = 2008-07-29 | work = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] ranked it as the 5th best Saturn game, stating that &quot;Treasure's original 1996 release remains a wonderful co-op beat-'em-up experience with impressive presentation and exciting combat&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-saturn-games-all-time/|title=Best Saturn games of all time|website=gamesradar|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WatchMojo.com]] voted it as the 7th best Saturn game, praising &quot;the beautiful hand-drawn sprites and elaborate backdrops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/id/12825|title=Top 10 Sega Saturn Games|website=WatchMojo.com|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ranked as the 4th top beat 'em up video game of all time by [[Heavy.com]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heavy.com/entertainment/2013/05/the-top-25-beat-em-up-video-games-part-3// The Top 25 Beat 'Em Up Video Games – Part 3 | HEAVY]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[ScrewAttack]] voted it as the [[ScrewAttack's Top 10|5th best beat 'em up of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ScrewAttack!|title=Top 10 Beat 'em Ups in Video Games {{!}} ScrewAttack!|date=2012-07-12|series=''[[ScrewAttack's Top 10]]''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB3w471oNDY|accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Podola was born in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. He was a fanatical member of the [[Hitler Youth]] movement.&lt;ref name=Stratford&gt;[http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/podola.htm Gunter Podola]&lt;/ref&gt; Podola moved to [[Canada]] in August 1952. On 1 March 1957 he was sentenced to 10 days' imprisonment following a conviction for [[burglary]] in [[Montreal]]. Then on 26 March he was sentenced for another 11 counts of theft and burglary and imprisoned for 2 years. On 25 July 1958 Podola was released and deported back to [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=Stratford/&gt;

==London==
Podola moved to [[London]] on 21 May 1959. He assumed the alias of ''Mike Colato'' and pretended to be a gangster.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JaUDhjsMdcEC&amp;pg=PA451&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;dq=%22Verne+Schiffman%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9VLn5uwFfp&amp;sig=Za8xbULUjRGg6xDAr1BP3qO6-Ds&amp;hl=pl#PPA451,M1 Google books - ''Villain's Paradise: A History of Britain's Underworld'', p452]&lt;/ref&gt; He broke into the house of an American model,&lt;ref name=Crimeandinvestigation&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/tv_programme/793/Infamous_Murders_Murdered_on_Duty.htm Infamous Murders: Murdered on Duty - Crime And Investigation Network]&lt;/ref&gt; Verne Schiffmann, and stole jewellery and furs worth [[pound sterling|£]]2,000.&lt;ref name=JMS107/&gt; He tried to blackmail her in return for her possessions, asking for £500,&lt;ref name=Google/&gt; but she notified the police who attempted to arrest Podola on 12 July 1959 in [[Kensington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimetime.co.uk/features/anthonyfrewin.php Crimetime]&lt;/ref&gt; Podola shot one of the officers, Detective Sergeant Raymond Purdy, through the heart with a [[Vis pistol|Radom 9mm semi-automatic pistol]].&lt;ref name=Stratford/&gt; He was later apprehended and Podola claimed he was beaten up by the police&lt;ref name=Hierons&gt;[http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/heritage/munksroll/munk_details.asp?ID=5003 Royal College of Physicians]&lt;/ref&gt; and that as a result he lost his memory of events.&lt;ref name=JMS107/&gt; The police claimed that he was merely hit on the head when they broke down the door to his hotel room.&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;

==Trial==
The start of the trial was delayed for nine days while a jury heard evidence of whether Podola was medically fit to stand trial.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894251,00.html Verdict on Podola - Time Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; After 3½ hours of deliberation, they decided he was.&lt;ref name=Stratford/&gt; A fresh jury was called to hear the trial itself.&lt;ref name=Stratford/&gt; When asked for his [[plea]], he replied: &quot;I do not remember the crime for which I stand accused ... I am unable to answer the charges.&quot;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; He was defended by [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Frederick Lawton]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref name=Google/&gt; [[Neurologist]] [[Michael Ashby]] gave evidence as an expert medical witness at his trial, as did [[psychiatrist]] Archibald Leigh, who claimed Podola was feigning his illness.&lt;ref name=Hierons/&gt;

The jury took 38 minutes&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; to find Podola guilty of capital murder, and he was sentenced to &quot;suffer death in the manner authorised by law&quot; by the trial judge, [[Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies|Mr Justice Edmund Davies]]. He later confessed his guilt.&lt;ref name=Hierons/&gt; The Home Secretary, [[R.A. Butler]], under a little-known and little-used power, referred the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which upheld the conviction, and the Attorney-General's refusal of leave to appeal to the House of Lords brought the case to a close in a fresh outburst of public controversy. Podola was hanged at [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth prison]] at 9.45 a.m. on 5 November 1959.&lt;ref name=Crimeandinvestigation/&gt; He was buried in the prison graveyard (grave 59).&lt;ref name=Stratford/&gt; Apart from his execution being the last for that of a police officer's murder in the United Kingdom, it took place five years before the last execution of any criminal and six years before the suspension and later abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/capital_hist.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlos Guillermo Suárez Mason''' (January 2, 1924 &amp;ndash; June 21, 2005) was an [[Argentine military]] officer convicted for [[Dirty War]] crimes during the 1976 — 83 [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]]. He was in charge of the [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Buenos Aires]], he enrolled at the [[Colegio Militar de la Nación|National War College]] in 1944, and took an interest in national politics before his 1948 graduation. A magnetic and charismatic figure, he was involved at that time in several liaisons with prominent women, through whom he invariably furthered his interests; he took little or no interest, however, in the children reported at that time to have been fathered by him.  Suárez Mason took part in a failed military coup against the populist President [[Juan Perón]] in 1951. He was forced to retreat to [[Uruguay]], and later collaborated with the [[Revolución Libertadora|overthrow of Perón in 1955]]. He was received back in Buenos Aires with honours following the coup's success on September 19.&lt;ref name=ln&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=714942 ''La Nación'': Falleció ayer el ex general Suárez Mason] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez Mason taught at the School of Higher War Studies, and rose in rank, becoming a [[military attaché]] to the Argentine Embassy in [[Ecuador]] in 1971, and a director of military intelligence in 1972. He was attached to the ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' [[counterinsurgency]] mission in 1975, and upon the  [[March 1976 coup]] against President [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]], was appointed Commander of the First Army Corps, a unit whose principal duty was to garrison the capital.&lt;ref name=ln/&gt;

During the subsequent dictatorship, Suárez Mason had purview over a number of the most notorious detention centers (among the over 300 such facilities that led to the [[Desaparecidos|disappearance]] of between 13,000 and 30,000 people. Those under his command included ''Automotores Orletti'', ''[[Pozo de Banfield]]'', ''La Cacha'', and ''El Olimpo''. He also supervised [[Policía Bonaerense]] Chief [[Ramón Camps]], as well as [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601|Army Intelligence Battalion 601]], which carried out numerous [[extortion]]s and [[kidnappings]] for ransom.&lt;ref name=dossier&gt;Andersen, Martin. ''Dossier secreto.'' Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  

He financed ''[[Cabildo (magazine)|Cabildo]]'', a far-right [[Catholic]] publication known at the time for its espousal of [[anti-semitism]], and relaunched the previously banned publication. Suárez Mason earned a reputation as a hard-line figure in the regime, particularly after steps toward political liberalization began in 1979, and fell out of favor with the president, General [[Jorge Videla]], after the latter's cancellation of ''[[Operation Soberanía]]'' (the aborted 1978 invasion of neighboring [[Chile]], at the height of the [[Beagle Conflict]]).&lt;ref name=dossier/&gt;  
 
Suárez Mason was relieved of his post at the First Army Corps in January 1980, and made Chairman of the Joint Military Chiefs. He oversaw Argentine tactical support for the July 1980 &quot;[[Luis García Meza Tejada|Cocaine Coup]]&quot; in [[Bolivia]], and later chaired the Latin American chapter of the [[World Anti-Communist League]]. He was appointed Director of the state oil concern, [[YPF]], by President [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] in December 1981, and in 1983, at the end of his tenure, the company recorded an US$ 6 billion annual loss (the largest in the world at the time).&lt;ref&gt;''The Guinness Book of World Records''. Random House, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations revealed that large quantities of fuel had been pirated from YPF by Suárez Mason through ''Sol Petróleo'', a [[dummy corporation]]; the latter entity made Suárez Mason a wealthy man, and was used by him to divert funds to the [[Contras]],&lt;ref name=mendez&gt;Méndez, Juan. ''Truth and Partial Justice in Argentina.'' Human Rights Watch, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the [[fascist]] organization, [[Propaganda Due|P2]] (to which he belonged).&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/06/22/elpais/p-00801.htm ''Clarín'': Murió el represor Suárez Mason] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983 return to democracy]], an [[arrest warrant]] was issued for Suárez Mason. He fled to the [[United States]] with a false passport, however, and took up residence in [[Miami]]. He was stripped of rank and ordered arrested by President [[Raúl Alfonsín]] on charges related to a putative 1985 plot to overthrow the democratic government.&lt;ref name=mendez/&gt; Pursuant to an [[Interpol]] order, however, he was arrested in [[Foster City, California]] in January 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/25/world/argentine-officer-is-arrested-in-us.html ''New York Times'': Argentine office is arrested] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on May 9, 1988, extradited to Buenos Aires to face charges of murdering 43 people and kidnapping a further 23, including newborn babies.&lt;ref&gt;''Clarín'': Trajeron a Suárez Mason. 10 May 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Convicted for these crimes, he was pardoned by President [[Carlos Menem]] in 1990, and fled to [[California]]. He was again extradited in 1995, and was prosecuted by [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] on charges of [[crimes against humanity]] for the kipnapping of minors.&lt;ref name=ln/&gt; He was later placed under house arrest, and in 2000, was condemned to life imprisonment in absentia by [[Judiciary of Italy|Italian courts]] for the murder of eight [[Italian Argentine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2000/12/07/p-01001.htm ''Clarín'': Condenaron a prisión perpetua en Italia a Suárez Mason y Riveros] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although prisoners aged over 70 are usually kept under house arrest in [[Argentina]], he would be reimprisoned in 2004 after abusing the terms of his detention. Suárez Mason developed [[upper gastrointestinal bleed]], and died at age 81 at the Military Hospital in Buenos Aires. He had been awaiting the hearing of charges related to 200 kidnappings, 30 murders and the sale of the babies of political prisoners during the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship of 1976-83]] in which he was a central figure.&lt;ref name=ln/&gt;&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

'''Guilliam Visagie''' (born about 1751; still alive in 1793) was a [[trekboer]] who settled in southern [[Namibia]] about 1786.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dedering1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tilman Dedering|title=Hate the Old and Follow the New: Khoekhoe and Missionaries in Early Nineteenth-century Namibia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anD2mOjDdMIC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=2013-09-11|year=1997|publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag|isbn=978-3-515-06872-7|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to have been the first person of European ancestry to have settled in the country.

Visagie was born about 1751 in the [[Dutch Cape Colony]], likely to parents of [[Huguenot]] descent. He became a farmer in the area near the [[Olifants River]]{{dn|date=November 2016}}. In 1780, he was found guilty of killing a [[Nama people|Nama]] and wounding two others. To escape punishment by the authorities, he and his wife moved north of the [[Orange River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TonchiLindeke2012&quot;/&gt;

In 1785, Guilliam and his wife Elsab Visagie settled in an area which he named [[Modderfontein, Namibia|Modderfontein]] (mud fountain), becoming the first Europeans to establish a permanent settlement in Namibia.&lt;ref name=tbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Keetmanshoop|url=http://tourbrief.com/preprod/egw/home/setup/images/stories/newsgeneral/www.namibialodges.com?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1230|publisher=Namibia Tourism on tourbrief.com|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 he was living at Swartmodder (modern [[Keetmanshoop]]), where he farmed and traded firearms to the Namas for cattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;TonchiLindeke2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victor L. Tonchi|author2=William A. Lindeke|author3=John J.

In 1793, he withdrew from his farm after a clash with Afrikaner [[Oorlam people|Oorlams]] commandos, who were apparently acting on orders from the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dedering1997&quot;/&gt;

'''Gundobad''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Gundobadus}}; {{circa}} 452 – 516 AD) was [[King of Burgundy|King of the Burgundians]] (473 – 516), succeeding his father [[Gundioc]] of Burgundy. Previous to this, he had been a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 472 – 473, succeeding his uncle [[Ricimer]].

== Early life ==
Gundobad seized the title of Patrician when his uncle [[Ricimer]], who had been the [[power behind the throne]] for the Western Empire, died on 18 August 472. According to John of Antioch, Gundobad had previously executed the deposed emperor [[Anthemius]] on his uncle's orders.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in C.D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila: Fifth-Century Byzantium and the Barbarians'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), pp. 122f&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in power, Gundobad elevated the current Count of the Domestics, [[Glycerius]], to the position of [[Western Roman Emperor]]. However, not long after this Gundobad left for Burgundy where his father, Gundioc, had died; the exact date is unclear, with authorities{{Who|date=March 2014}} stating it was in either 473 or 474. Once in Burgundy, his three brothers have been assumed to challenge to his rule: [[Godegisel]], [[Chilperic II of Burgundy|Chilperic II]] and Gundomar. Ian Wood speculates that Gundobad's departure may have been connected with the arrival of a new emperor, [[Julius Nepos]], who had the support of the Roman Emperor in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''The Merovingian Kingdoms'' (London: Longman, 1994), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Once Julius Nepos landed in [[Portus]] (June 474), he deposed Glycerius, whom he made bishop of [[Salona]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anonymus Valesianus'', 7.36. Translated in J.C. Rolfe, ''Ammianus Marcellinus'' (Harvard: Loeb Classical Library, 1972), vol. 3 p. 531&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reign ==
The events of the first decades of Gundobad's reign are not well known. The only available source is [[Gregory of Tours]], who wrote almost a century later. According to Gregory, Gundobad set about ridding himself of his brothers. First slain was Gundomar, though little is known of this encounter.&lt;ref name=HF28&gt;Gregory of Tours, ''History of the Franks in Ten Books'', 2.28&lt;/ref&gt;

Next killed was Chilperic. According to Gregory, Gundobad had his wife drowned by tying a stone round her neck and Chilperic's two daughters driven into exile. The older daughter, [[Chroma of Burgundy|Chroma]] became a nun.  The other, [[Clotilde]], had been seen by envoys of [[Clovis I]], King of the [[Franks]], who told their master of her beauty and intelligence. Clovis then asked Gundobad for Clotilde's hand in marriage. Gundobad was said to have been afraid to deny him.&lt;ref name=HF28/&gt;

However, a letter written by [[Avitus of Vienne|Avitus]], bishop of [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], consoling Gundobad on the death of an unnamed daughter, gives details that suggest there was more to the story. According to the explication of Danuta Shanzer and Ian Wood of Avitus' notoriously difficult Latin, the bishop writes, &quot;In the past, with ineffable tender-heartedness, you mourned the deaths of your brothers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shanzer and Wood, ''Avitus of Vienne, letters and selected prose'' (Liverpool: University Press, 2002), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Avitus alludes to Gundobad's intent to marry his deceased daughter to a foreign ruler, whom they suggest was Clovis: &quot;Indeed,&quot; they write, &quot;Clovis is really the only likely candidate as a prospective son-in-law for Gundobad shortly after 501.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shanzer and Wood, ''Avitus of Vienne'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; If their reading is correct, then it is likely that Clotilde was offered to Clovis as an act of diplomacy not subservience.

At this point occurs the earliest firm date in Gundobad's reign: in the early months of 490, while [[Odoacer]] and [[Theodoric the Great]] were locked in battle over control of [[Pavia]], the Burgundians seized the opportunity to invade northwestern Italy. They devastated [[Liguria]], and carried away an unknown number of victims into captivity, if not slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', translated by Thomas J. Dunlap (Berkeley: University of California, 1988), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Once Theodoric had killed Odoacer and was securely in control of Italy, he sent bishop [[Epiphanius of Pavia]] on a mission to ransom as many of these captives as possible. Accompanied by Bishop Victor of Turin, they crossed the Alps in March.&lt;ref&gt;Ennodius, ''Vita Epifani'', 136-147; translated in Sr. Genevieve Marie Cook, ''The Life of Saint Epiphanius by Ennodius: A translation with an introduction and commentary'' (Washington: Catholic University of America, 1942), pp. 87-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Shanzer and Wood believe Epiphanius was possibly also entrusted with a mission in connection with the marriage of Gundobad's son [[Sigismund]] to Theodoric's daughter Ostrogotho.&lt;ref&gt;Shanzer and Wood, ''Avitus of Vienne'', pp. 17f&lt;/ref&gt; In his account of this visit, [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]], who accompanied Epiphanius on this journey, describes Godegisel as ''germanus regis'' the &quot;king's brother&quot; and not king—again contradicting Gregory of Tour's later account.&lt;ref&gt;Ennodius, ''Vita Epifani'', 174; translated by Cook, ''The Life of Saint Epiphanius'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Ennodius notes that &quot;more than six thousand souls&quot; were so ransomed; from [[Lyon]]s alone 400 men were thus freed.&lt;ref&gt;Ennodius, ''Vita Epifani'', 171, 172; translated by Cook, ''The Life of Saint Epiphanius'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory of Tours states the battle with his third brother, Godegisel, raged long. Unaware of the other's actions, each called upon Clovis trying to persuade him to join forces against the other. Clovis sided with Godegisel, who had offered him his pleasure of tribute; Wood observes that Clovis' wife, Clotilde, whose father had been killed by Gundobad, &quot;was not likely to encourage good relations between the Franks and the Burgundians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''The Merovingian Kingdoms'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Together they crushed Gundobad's force. Gundobad fled but King Clovis pursued him to [[Avignon]]. Gundobad feared the worst with Clovis's army at the gates. But Aridius went from Gundobad to Clovis and convinced him to spare Gundobad in return for a yearly tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory of Tours, ''History'', 2.32&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Marius of Avenches]] dates this conflict to 500.

Gundobad later broke his promise of tribute as he regained his power and besieged Godegisel, locked up in the city of Vienne. As famine devoured Vienne, Godegisel expelled the common people from the city for fear for himself. An outraged expelled artisan seeking vengeance on Godegisel went to Gundobad, and with his help he navigated the aqueduct and broke into the city. Gundobad murdered Godegisel in 501 in an [[Arianism|Arian]] church along with the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory of Tours, ''History'', 2.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The next event about which information has survived is Gundobad's role concerning the [[Battle of Vouillé]]. He was one of several rulers to whom king Theoderic sent letters urging peace, and asking for mediation between [[Alaric II]] and Clovis.&lt;ref&gt;Cassiodorus, ''Variae'', III.2&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Theoderic's best efforts, the two kings met at Vouillé, and Alaric was slain; according to [[Isidore of Seville]], Gundobad supported Clovis in this battle. Isidore also provides a hint that Gundobad exploited the Visigothic defeat by plundering [[Narbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''History of the Goths'', chapters 36, 37. Translation by Guido Donini and Gordon B. Ford, ''Isidore of Seville's History of the Goths, Vandals, and Suevi'', second revised edition (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1970), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed by the threat of the [[Byzantine Navy]], which had been hovering off the Italian shore around the time of the battle, the Ostrogothic army arrived to relieve the Burgundian siege of [[Arles]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heather, ''The Goths'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herwig Wolfram, the Burgundians were &quot;the real victims of the Ostrogothic counteroffensive&quot; following the defeat of their cousins at Vouillé. &quot;Not only had they lost all their conquered territories and hope of acquiring Arles and Avignon but all their territory as far as [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]] had been devastated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of King Clovis of the Franks in 511, the Burgundians became the most prestigious people in Gaul. He was favored by the court of Constantinople, who awarded him the title of ''[[magister militum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''The Merovingian Kingdoms'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Gundobad died peacefully, succeeded by his son [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]] in 516. He also had another son: [[Godomar]], who would succeed his brother after his death in 524.

== Learning ==
In some of the manuscripts of the ''[[Lex Burgundionum]]'', Gundobad named as publishing this code of law on 29 March of the second year of his reign. However, there are a number of inconsistencies in this ascription, and L. R. deSalis proposed a restored version of this passage which does not include a date—which would better fit the reign of his son, Sigismund. Although she accepts the strong likelihood that the ''Lex Burgundionum'' as we have it was the product of Sigismund's reign, Katherine Fisher Drew still argues that a core of this law code is the product of Gundobad or his chancellery.&lt;ref&gt;Drew, ''The Burgundian code: book of constitutions or law of Gundobad'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1972), pp. 5-8, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters of [[bishop]] Avitus and [[Cassiodorus]] provide glimpses of Gundobad's intellectual side. Avitus, a Catholic bishop, answers questions posed by an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]] about religion in several letters, showing a great [[religious toleration|religious tolerance]], and may be the reason Gregory of Tours later thought he had secretly converted to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae'' 22, 30; Gregory of Tours, ''History'', 2.33&lt;/ref&gt; Cassiodorus' ''Variae'' includes a group of letters which discuss obtaining and sending a time piece to Gundobad as a diplomatic present.&lt;ref&gt;''Variae'', I.45,46&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gundolf Köhler''' (August 27, 1959 – September 26, 1980) was a [[Germans|German]] [[far right|right-wing extremist]] who planted a bomb at the 1980 [[Oktoberfest]] in [[Munich]] causing what is known as the [[Oktoberfest terror attack|1980 Oktoberfest terror attack]].

Köhler was born in [[Villingen-Schwenningen|Schwenningen]], and was studying [[geology]] in the [[University of Tübingen]] at the time of the attack.  While at Tübingen, he was a member of the Tübingen University Students Circle (''[[w:de:Hochschulring Tübinger Studenten|Hochschulring Tübinger Studenten]]''), a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] student group, and was described as a loner and [[gun nut]].  By the time of his death, he had moved to [[Donaueschingen]]. He also took part in the [[Far right in Germany|neo-Nazi]] Hoffmann Military Sports Group ([[w:de:Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann|Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/10/opinion/op-18655 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Strange Ties: The Stasi and the Neo-Fascists | first=Martin A. | last=Lee | date=September 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Köhler planted a [[pipe bomb]] in a trash can on September 26, 1980, near one of the entrances to the Munich Oktoberfest; it exploded at 10:19 PM ([[UTC+01:00|GMT+1]]), killing 13 and injuring over 200. He did not get away fast enough and was killed in the attack himself.  It is officially believed that he was the sole perpetrator of the attack, but doubts remain as to whether he acted alone (see [[Oktoberfest terror attack#Criticism of the official investigation| Criticism of the official investigation]]).

In an attempt to corner the local market on [[gas station]]s, Dhinsa defrauded customers, [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|evaded taxes]], committed at least two murders, and is believed to have ordered eight others. He is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release in a federal prison.

==Early life==
Dhinsa was born a [[Sikh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/jan/05us.htm|date=5 January 1999|title=Rags-to-riches Sikh businessman charged with murder|publisher=Rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and emigrated to [[the Bronx]] in 1982. He worked as a gas station attendant until he was able to save enough money to lease the station himself. As business improved, Dhinsa's company, Citygas Gasoline Corp &lt;ref&gt;[http://appsext8.dos.state.ny.us/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=1580441&amp;p_corpid=1479346&amp;p_entity_name=citygas&amp;p_name_type=%25&amp;p_search_type=BEGINS&amp;p_srch_results_page=0 Entity Information for Citygas Gasoline Corp.], New York State Department of State Division of Corporations&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;City Gas&quot; opened more stations in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. At its height, City Gas had 51 locations and 300 employees, with annual revenues of $60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filling Stations' Owner Held in Fraud and Killings|author=|date=9 July 1997|publisher=The New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/09/nyregion/filling-stations-owner-held-in-fraud-and-killings.html?pagewanted=all | first=David M. | last=Herszenhorn | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal activities==
When Dhinsa leased his first gas station in 1984, neighborhood residents were using the lot to park their cars. According to a witness, Dhinsa smashed every windshield with a [[baseball bat]]. The cars were moved, and the gas station became profitable.&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New York Times|date=10 July 1997|author=Dan Barry|title=Police Say Man Stopped at Nothing for Gasoline Empire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/10/nyregion/police-say-man-stopped-at-nothing-for-gasoline-empire.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he expanded his business, Dhinsa modified gas pumps, evaded taxes on gasoline bought in bulk, and kept his employees silent with death threats. He was arrested in 1990 on suspicion of kidnapping, robbery, and assault, but served only 90 days by pleading guilty to a weapons charge.&lt;ref name=barry/&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99feb25/world.htm#6|title=Jury awards life term to Dhinsa|date=11 March 1999|publisher=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he was convicted of weapons charges again and served a year in prison.&lt;ref name=barry/&gt;

In July 1995, Dhinsa ordered associates to kidnap an employee he suspected of stealing. When the victim's brother came looking for him in early 1997, Dhinsa ordered his murder. This killing was reported to police by several residents of the neighborhood. Police discovered that Dhinsa's brother Gurdip, who had fled to India to avoid prosecution for a 1991 murder, was back in the U.S. and was working at City Gas. On May 16, 1997, police surrounded the City Gas headquarters and arrested three employees, including Gurdip. When Gurmeet Dhinsa arrived at the scene, he was held for questioning and released. Although Dhinsa was released, a task force was formed to look into his operation, including the investigation of several disappearances and unsolved homicides.&lt;ref name=barry/&gt; The kidnapped employee was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New York Times|title=Owner of Gas Station Chain is Described as Killer in Trial|date=5 January 1999|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDB143EF936A35752C0A96F958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 1, 1997, police were called by a man who claimed Dhinsa had threatened him and his family. Later that day, investigators stopped Dhinsa and searched the car he was driving. When Dhinsa opened the trunk, the police discovered circuit boards for gas pumps.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;This evidence, along with other evidence obtained from Dhinsa's car, was suppressed during pretrial motions due to doubts of [[probable cause]]. Dhinsa claimed that the traffic stop was unconstitutional, and that the seizure of his car six days later constituted an unreasonable search. This decision was overturned before trial; see &quot;Docket No. 98-1605&quot; from U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
Police arrested Dhinsa on July 7. At the same time, Dhinsa's car was seized and inventoried. Evidence of gas pump tampering, including Department of Consumer Affairs metal seals and inspection stickers, was found during the search.&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt;

On August 22, 1997, Dhinsa was indicted by a grand jury on 29 counts including racketeering, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, and witness intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=2nd&amp;navby=case&amp;no=981605|publisher=U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals|title=Docket No. 98-1605|date=December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dhinsa was represented by high-profile defense attorney [[Gerald Shargel]], but was found guilty of murder and racketeering after an eight-week trial. Although the prosecution sought the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], the jury turned down the request and Dhinsa was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; In addition, Dhinsa was forced to pay $1.75 million in restitution and fines&amp;mdash;$625,000 to the family of each victim as well as a separate $500,000 fine to the city&amp;mdash;and his businesses were auctioned by the government to cover civil fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E4D91639F934A25753C1A96F958260|title=Businessman Is Fined In Two Contract Killings|publisher=The New York Times|date=17 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Television ==
The story of the police investigation and prosecution of Dhinsa is the subject of an episode of [[The FBI Files]] entitled &quot;Deadly Business&quot; [[List of The FBI Files episodes|(Season 3, Episode 9)]].

'''Gustavo &quot;Gus&quot; Fring''' is a fictional character in ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', played by [[Giancarlo Esposito]]. Fring is a prominent [[methamphetamine]] distributor in the [[Southwestern United States]], who uses several legitimate businesses, including a chain of successful fast food [[fried chicken restaurant]]s called Los Pollos Hermanos and an [[industrial laundry]] facility called Lavanderia Brillante, as fronts for a vast drug operation. Gus maintains a positive exterior; he takes an active role in managing his front businesses and is a [[boosterism|booster]] for the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], making large donations to the agency's Albuquerque office. However, Gus is ruthless and [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] in managing his vast drug empire. He employs a number of enforcers and has personally killed rivals and associates.&lt;ref name=AMC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/gustavo-fring|title=Gustavo Fring|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his portrayal of Gus, Esposito won the [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] for [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] at the [[3rd Critics' Choice Television Awards]] and was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] for the [[64th Primetime Emmy Awards]]. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' ranked Fring number 3 in its list of the 20 Best Characters of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Josh|title=The 20 Best TV Characters of 2011|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/12/the-20-best-tv-characters-of-2011.html?p=2|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|accessdate=June 30, 2012|date=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' named him #3 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time,&lt;ref&gt;Bretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). &quot;Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time&quot;.

==Character biography==

===Early life===
Gustavo is originally from [[Chile]]. He also goes by the nickname 'gus'. He emigrated to [[Mexico]] in the 1980s during the dictatorship of [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;her&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hermanos|series=[[Breaking Bad]]|credits=[[Vince Gilligan]]|network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|location=[[Albuquerque]] | airdate=September 4, 2011|season=4|number=8|url=http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/episodes/season-4/hermanos}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his longtime friend and partner, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Maximino Arciniega|Maximino &quot;Max&quot; Arciniega]], Gus started a chicken restaurant called Los Pollos Hermanos. Max was murdered by the [[Juárez Cartel]], leading Gus to emigrate to the United States and re-establish Los Pollos Hermanos as a chain of [[fast-food]] restaurants in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. Using his restaurants' supply chain as a front, Gus began distributing drugs in the [[American southwest]] on behalf of the cartel, an operation that eventually grew to encompass [[methamphetamine]].

Gus claims to have children, yet they have never been seen onscreen and little else about his family life has been revealed. It is implied that &quot;Gus Fring&quot; may be an [[Pseudonym|assumed name]]; neither [[Hank Schrader|Hank]] or [[Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]] can find any record of his existence before his arrival in Mexico. [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]], the cartel's leader, mentions that he spares Gus' life only because he knows who Gus is, and warns him that he &quot;isn't in Chile anymore&quot;; in a flashback scene, [[Hector Salamanca]] mockingly refers to him as &quot;Grand [[Generalissimo]]&quot;, implying that Gus may have had connections to the Pinochet regime. Gilligan has stated that he purposely left Gus' origin ambiguous, comparing it to [[Pulp Fiction#The mysterious 666 briefcase|the briefcase in ''Pulp Fiction'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/vince-gilligan-of-breaking-bad-talks-about-ending-the-season-and-the-series/ | title=Vince Gilligan of ‘Breaking Bad’ Talks About Ending the Season, and the Series |work=The New York Times | date=October 9, 2011 | accessdate=October 11, 2011 | author=Itzkoff, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Breaking Bad''==
===Season two===
{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}
When [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] seeks a buyer for his high-quality meth, [[Saul Goodman]] puts him in contact with Gus. Walter and his partner, [[Jesse Pinkman]], arrange a meeting with the seldom-seen Gus at a Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in the South Valley, but Gus seemingly never shows up. Walter later realizes that Gus is the restaurant proprietor, and that he had purposely scheduled the meeting at his own restaurant in order to observe Walter and Jesse. Upon being confronted by Walter, Gus tells him that he is not interested in conducting business since Jesse was late and [[substance intoxication|high]] during the meeting, and is thus potentially unreliable. Walter persuades Gus to reconsider his decision, promising that he will never have to deal with Jesse and that their product will earn him enormous returns.

Gus eventually buys 38 pounds of Walter's meth for $1.2 million; the timing of the transaction forces Walter to miss the birth of his daughter, Holly. Shortly afterward, Gus is given a tour of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s [[Albuquerque]] field office, along with other local [[boosterism|boosters]]. While there, he discovers that Walter has lung cancer and that his brother-in-law, [[Hank Schrader]], is a DEA agent.

===Season three===
{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}
Pleased with how well Walter's product has sold, Gus offers him $3 million for three months of his time. Walter, whose family life is in shambles and who has no desire to continue cooking, respectfully declines the offer. Later, Gus intervenes in a plot by the Juárez Cartel to kill Walter, narrowly saving his life. Gus finally persuades Walter to accept his offer after showing him a large-scale &quot;superlab&quot; housed under an industrial laundry facility that he owns, outfitted with top-of-the-line equipment and capable of producing at least 200 pounds of meth a week. He partners Walter with [[Gale Boetticher]], a talented chemist who set up the superlab.

Gus' protection of Walter puts him at odds with the Cartel, which seeks revenge against Walter for betraying Hector's nephew [[Tuco Salamanca]], who was subsequently killed by Hank. Gus promises one of his superiors, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Juan Bolsa|Juan Bolsa]], that the Cartel will be free to kill Walter once his cooking tenure has been completed. When [[The Cousins (Breaking Bad)|Leonel and Marco Salamanca]], Hector's twin nephews, impatiently object, Gus overrides the Cartel and gives the pair permission to kill Hank instead. An anonymous phone call arranged by Gus alerts Hank to the hit, allowing him to survive the Cousins' ambush despite being critically wounded; Hank kills Marco and cripples Leonel. Upon hearing that Leonel has survived, Gus personally delivers fried chicken to the police detail at the hospital, allowing his henchman [[Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]] to sneak into Leonel's room and give him a lethal injection.

Hank's attempted assassination causes the U.S. and Mexican governments to launch a crackdown on the cartel. Juan Bolsa, who realizes too late that Gus has engineered the entire fiasco in order to seize control of the methamphetamine market, is killed by the [[Mexican Federal Police|Mexican Federales]]. After learning that Hank was contacted moments before the hit, Walter makes the same conclusion and requests a meeting with Gus to discuss the future of their arrangement. Gus offers to extend their agreement to a long-term, $15 million-a-year deal, which Walter accepts. Gus lets Walter keep Jesse as his cooking partner, but makes it clear that he only tolerates him because he respects Walter's abilities.

Walter's relationship with Gus is jeopardized when Walter ends up killing two of Gus' dealers to protect Jesse. Gus, along with Mike and fellow henchman [[Victor (Breaking Bad)|Victor]], confront Walt in the desert and demands that he explain himself. Walt implies that Gus ordered the dealers to kill Tomas, the eleven-year-old brother of Jesse's girlfriend [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Andrea Cantillo|Andrea]], which Gus denies. Gus seemingly accepts Walter's plea to regard the episode as a &quot;hiccup&quot; and allow him to continue cooking meth, but re-appoints Gale as Walter's assistant. Gus visits Gale at his apartment and surreptitiously instructs him to learn Walter's formula so as to be able to cook alone should Walter die from cancer, though in reality, he is planning on killing Walt, and the amount of overhead he has put into the meth operation makes it impossible for them to stop production for even a short time.

Walter deduces Gus' true intentions and plots with Jesse to kill Gale, as insurance against Gus killing either Walt or Jesse. Walter surmises that any delay in production would weaken Gus' position, and that without Gale, Gus would be forced to retain Walter as the only cook capable of producing the high-quality meth needed to sustain the operation. As Walter sets out to kill Gale, he is intercepted by Victor and brought to the lab, where Mike is waiting for him. Walter convinces Mike to allow him to call Jesse, under the pretext of luring Jesse to the lab to betray him to Mike. Instead, Walter instructs Jesse to kill Gale. Victor rushes to Gale's apartment, but is too late to stop Jesse from shooting him.

===Season four===
{{main|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}
In the aftermath of Gale's murder, Victor finds Jesse in shock sitting in his car but, while Jesse was unobserved at the crime scene by neighbors, Victor was seen and acted very suspiciously to many of the onlookers. Forcing Jesse back to the lab at gunpoint, an enraged Victor informs Mike of Gale's death and of his being noticed at the crime scene. Walt asks Mike to allow him to cook, since Gus will be even angrier if they fall further behind on production. Victor dons a gas mask and informs Walt that he knows Walt's exact cooking method from watching him at the lab and Walt had only made his and Jesse's fate worse by murdering Gale. Victor seemingly knows Walt's method, a fact that Walt had never foreseen and is busy cooking when Gustavo Fring enters the lab. Gus calmly and silently descends the stairs and begins to change into a hazmat suit as Walt becomes increasing frantic trying to justify his actions and argue that Victor may know the steps but could never operate such a large and complex lab, problems would invariably arise that only Walt would be able to recognize and cope with. Gus all the while silently changes and now stands directly in front of both Walt and Jesse holding a razor sharp box cutter and, in a gruesome show of force, suddenly grabs and fatally slashes Victor's throat with a [[box cutter]] and spraying Walter and Jesse with Victor's blood, staring unemotionally into their eyes as Victor struggles and bleeds to death. Gustavo then redresses in the same manner speaking only once before leaving saying &quot;get back to work&quot; Walter knows that he has fallen out of favor with Gus and fears that he will eventually be killed. Walter decides to pre-emptively strike against Gus, illegally purchasing from Lawson ([[Jim Beaver]]) an untraceable .38 [[Ruger LCR]] revolver for the task.

In response to Mike's concerns that Jesse's guilt-ridden recklessness could attract unwanted attention, Gus instructs Mike to take Jesse along as a passenger on a series of seemingly mundane pick-up runs around New Mexico. Aware that Jesse can't be scared into behaving, Gus instead orchestrates a fake robbery for Jesse to foil, thereby boosting his loyalty and self-esteem. Later, Jesse helps Mike retrieve stolen meth from a pair of junkies. Impressed with Jesse's mettle, Gus deems him ready to take on a greater role in the operation.

Meanwhile, Gus' conflict with the Cartel escalates. The Cartel sends several men to kidnap Gus' chemical supplier Duane Chow, but Mike kills the four gunmen. Later, they start attacking Gus' refrigerated trucks. In the first attack, the attackers manage to kill the driver and shoot up the truck, but are thwarted when Mike (hiding in the back of the truck) surprises them and shoots them. The second attack is more successful, as these attackers kill the driver, then lock the guards in the back and suffocate them to death with fumes from the truck's exhaust. They then steal a fry batter bucket full of meth and distribute it to a pair of junkies.

Gus arranges a meeting with the Cartel where he offers a one-time payment of $50 million in exchange for a settlement of grievances and a complete severance of their partnership. The Cartel buttonman, Gaff, refuses, reiterating the cartels' demand that Gus hand over Walter. A flashback scene reveals the origin of Gus' animosity toward the Cartel: twenty years earlier, Hector executed Gus' partner [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Maximino Arciniega|Max]] during a meeting with the Cartel's boss, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio Vuente]].

Hank begins to suspect that Gus is involved in &quot;blue sky&quot; when he finds a Los Pollos Hermanos napkin among the evidence collected from Gale's apartment, which he finds odd considering that Gale was a [[vegan]]. Hank retrieves Gus' fingerprints during a visit to Los Pollos Hermanos and matches them with prints found in Gale's apartment. Gus is questioned, but his explanation satisfies both the DEA and the police. Hank remains suspicious and investigates Gus on his own. Still handicapped from injuries inflicted by Leonel and Marco, Hank obliviously asks for Walter's help in attaching a tracking device to Gus' car at Los Pollos Hermanos. Gus is warned by Walter and removes the device before driving anywhere but home and the restaurant. However, this doesn't deter Hank's investigation.

In an attempt to defuse tensions with the Cartel, Gus agrees to share Walter's formula. Because he does not trust Walter, Gus and Mike take Jesse to Mexico, where Jesse cooks a batch of &quot;blue sky&quot; in the cartel's own superlab. To Jesse's alarm, Gus seemingly agrees to have Jesse work for the Cartel on a permanent basis. However, during a party celebrating the agreement, Gus kills Don Eladio and the rest of the Cartel's leadership with a poisoned bottle of [[tequila]]. To convince Don Eladio and his crew that the tequila is safe, Gus drinks the first shot, having taken capsules that delayed the poison and allowed him to purge. Gus, Jesse, and Mike shoot their way out of Don Eladio's compound.  Mike is wounded in the shootout.  Jessie drives himself, Gus and Mike to an elaborate medical tent that Gus arranged for in advance. There, Gus is treated by his private doctors and quickly recovers.  Mike remains in the medical tent as he is unable to travel.

[[File:Gus dies.png|alt=Actor Giancarlo Esposito, portraying Gus Fring on Breaking Bad, in a blue suit with half of his face blown off by a bomb|thumb|Gus Fring after having his face blown off by Walt's bomb. The special effect took months of preparation.]]

Gus deems Jesse fit to cook Walter's formula and run the superlab on his own. However, Jesse insists that he will not cook for Gus if Walter is killed. Gus' henchmen kidnap Walter and take him out to the desert, where Gus fires him, tells him that he intends to have Hank killed, and threatens to kill his entire family if Walter attempts to interfere. Believing Gus will make good on his threat, Walter plants a [[car bomb]] in Gus' Volvo, but Gus manages to evade the trap. Meanwhile, Gus visits Hector in his nursing home and tauntingly informs him that all of his relatives are dead and the Cartel has been destroyed.

Walter learns from Jesse about Gus' visits to Hector's nursing home. Realizing that Gus and Hector are enemies, Walter visits Hector and offers him an opportunity to exact revenge on Gus. The two hatch a plot to lure Gus back to Hector's nursing home, starting with Hector paying a visit to the DEA. Gus learns about Hector's visit from Tyrus and, assuming Hector has become an [[informant]], decides that he must be eliminated. Against Tyrus' advice, Gus visits Hector and prepares to inject him with a lethal poison. However, Hector begins ringing his bell frantically, activating a home-made bomb Walter has attached to his wheelchair. Upon realizing what is going on, Gus stands and attempts to escape, but it is too late; the subsequent explosion blows off half of his face and kills Hector and Tyrus. Gus walks out of the room, calmly adjusts his tie, and collapses to the floor, dead.

==''Better Call Saul''==
In the [[Klick (Better Call Saul)|second season finale]] of ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', a note was left on the windshield of [[Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]]'s car signaling a possible involvement of Gustavo Fring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/74527/20160421/better-call-saul-creators-confirmed-fan-theory-breaking-bads-gus-fring-back.htm|title=‘Better Call Saul’ Creators Confirmed Fan Theory That 'Breaking Bad's' Gus Fring Is Coming Back|author=Kleyman, Katia|work=Design &amp; Trend|date=April 21, 2016|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that Gus may appear in ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and Esposito expressed interest in reprising his role.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yWdmLe9_vE&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of the show have confirmed that Fring is set to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/74527/20160421/better-call-saul-creators-confirmed-fan-theory-breaking-bads-gus-fring-back.htm|title=‘Better Call Saul’ Creators Confirmed Fan Theory That 'Breaking Bad's' Gus Fring Is Coming Back|author=Kleyman, Katia|work=Design &amp; Trend|date=April 21, 2016|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors were eventually confirmed in January 2017 by AMC and by Esposito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4632188/giancarlo-esposito-better-call-saul/|title=Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito Is Coming to Better Call Saul|author=Snierson, Dan|date=January 11, 2017|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character development==

Initially, [[Giancarlo Esposito]] was offered a character that was described to him as &quot;very admirable, very polite&quot;, and he decided to play that character as if he had &quot;some kind of a secret&quot;. Without knowing what that secret was, Esposito understood the potential Gus had as a growing character, therefore rejecting offers for guest appearances and insisting on becoming a series regular.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/09/idUS233462123820111009|title=How Giancarlo Esposito Forced 'Breaking Bad' to Get Even Better|last=Potts|first=Kimberly|date=October 9, 2011|agency=Reuters|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve Gus' trademark calmness, Esposito utilized [[yoga]] techniques, which allowed him to convey the character as &quot;being a good listener.&quot; The humanity of Gus' personality played an integral role in his development, especially the very deep relationship with [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Maximino Arciniega|Max]], which was interpreted by some viewers &amp;ndash; and even Esposito himself &amp;ndash; as possibly romantic.&lt;ref name=AOL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/10/09/gus-fring-giancarlo-esposito-on-breaking-bad/|title=Gus Fring Speaks: Giancarlo Esposito on 'Breaking Bad's' Most Memorable Villain|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|date=October 9, 2011|publisher=[[AOL TV]]|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of Max contributed to Gus' evolution into a ruthless criminal; he stops at nothing to avenge Max's death, including the gradual killing of Hector's entire family. However, the loss of Max is also what cultivated Gus' desire to create a new &quot;family&quot; by empowering his meth empire, as well as the chicken restaurants. Gilligan has stated that he decided against the show officially confirming or denying whether or not Max and Gus were, in fact, lovers; however, he also said that they &quot;probably were lovers.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;entw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/12/18/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-season-finale/|title=Best of 2011 (Behind the Scenes): 'Breaking Bad' creator Vince Gilligan talks about That Scene from the season finale|author=Franich, Darren|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 18, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moments before dying, Gus manages to calmly adjust his tie even after having half his face blown off. Esposito saw it as an important gesture of &quot;when a person goes to what they’ve always done&quot;, in order &quot;to be complete in his leaving this world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/10/10/interview-talking-gus-fring-with-giancarlo-esposito/|title=Interview: Talking Gus Fring with Giancarlo Esposito|last=Poniewozik|first=James|date=October 10, 2011|work=Time magazine|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gus' death scene has made an impact on fans of the series, who compared his face to that of [[Two-Face]] as seen in the film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''; some proceeded to create [[Halloween]] masks and T-shirts.&lt;ref name=Halloween&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/10/download_a_gus_fring_halloween.html|title=Download Our Gus Fring Mask for Halloween|last=Paskin|first=Willa|newspaper=[[New York Magazine]]|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gus's popularity, as well as his importance to the series' development, made room for possible &quot;flashback&quot; type appearances in future episodes,&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2011/10/10/breaking-bad-face-off-gus-fring/|title='Breaking Bad' face off: Gus Fring/Giancarlo Esposito talks about THAT SCENE|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=October 10, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that idea never came to fruition. 

==Trivia==

'''Gus Winkler''' (March 28, 1901 &amp;ndash; October 9, 1933) was an American gangster who headed a [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition-era]] criminal gang specializing in armed robbery and murder for hire with [[Fred &quot;Killer&quot; Burke]]. Winkler was an associate of Chicago mob boss [[Al Capone]] and is considered a suspect in the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]. 

==Early life==
Winkler was born August Henry Winkeler to Bernard J. Winkeler (September 28, 1862- November 23, 1928) and Mary K. (June 1, 1862- March 5, 1923) in [[Lemay, Missouri]]; he was a brother to Clara (April 21, 1895-June 23, 1987), Jacob C. (1893-1961) and Anna C. (1890-1960). 

In September 1917, at the age of 16, Winkler enlisted in the [[United States Army Ambulance Service|U.S. Army Ambulance Corps]] and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with the [[91st Infantry Division (United States)|91st Infantry Division]]. After his return to America, Winkler joined up with the notorious [[Egan's Rats]] gang. It was during this time that he first became associated with [[Fred Burke|Fred &quot;Killer&quot; Burke]] and [[Robert Carey (gangster)|Bob Carey]], among others. Winkler later confessed to his wife Georgette to participating in the &quot;one-way ride&quot; murder of auto thief Wesley Smith in July 1923. After the heart of the Egan gang went to prison for mail robbery in November 1924, Winkler and his pals signed on with the [[Neighborhoods of St. Louis|South City]]-based [[Cuckoo Gang]]. Winkler, Burke, and [[Milford Jones]] were captured in downtown [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on June 5, 1925 after a high-speed chase and shootout with the [[St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department|St. Louis police]]. Within a year and a half, Winkler moved to [[Detroit]] and briefly aligned himself with [[the Purple Gang]] that was under control of [[Abe Bernstein]]. 

==Partnership with Al Capone==
After arousing the ire of [[Al Capone]] by kidnapping a Detroit gambler, Winkler and his pals hired out for freelance work from Capone and the [[Chicago Outfit]] in exchange for releasing the gambler unharmed. Capone and Winkler cultivated a close friendship and the Chicago mob boss used Gus and his friends (Fred Burke, Bob Carey, [[Raymond &quot;Crane Neck&quot; Nugent]] and [[Fred Goetz]]) for special assignments. Capone jokingly referred to the men as his &quot;American Boys.&quot; Circumstantial evidence and testimony from Georgette Winkeler indicates that Winkler and his crew may have participated in the July 1928 murder of Brooklyn gangster [[Frankie Yale]] and the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]. The American Boys were also implicated in the murder of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] police officer [http://www.odmp.org/officer/14672-patrolman-george-zientara George Zientara] on April 16, 1928, who was shot dead in the aftermath of an American Express armored truck heist. Winkler himself enjoyed Capone's complete confidence, even after Fred Burke was publicly named as a suspect in the massacre and the discovery of the murder weapons. Winkler often told people that he worked as a 'contractor' which might have played on the undertone of the word and his career as a [[contract killer]].

==Death==
The fallout from the Valentine's Day massacre proved to be the undoing of the American Boys as an organized sub-group. Fred Burke was eventually captured and imprisoned for the murder of [[St. Joseph, Michigan]] police office Charles Skelly, Bob Carey was exiled from Chicago after attempting to blackmail a friend of Capone's, and Crane Neck Nugent vanished without a trace. Gus Winkler, along with St. Louis gangster John &quot;Babs&quot; Moran, was severely injured in a car accident in [[Berrien County, Michigan]] on August 3, 1931. While Winkler survived, the crash cost him one of his eyes. While in his hospital bed, Winkler was accused of planning and taking part in the September 1930 robbery of [[US$]]2 million from a bank in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]. While Winkler hadn't done the robbery, he knew who did and claimed he could convince the actual heisters to turn over the loot. After this assurance, Capone reluctantly put up Winkler's $100,000 cash bond. After his release, Winkler did indeed deliver as promised. By the next year, Gus had carved out a lucrative position in the rackets of Chicago's North Side, despite his cooperation with authorities. 

The beginning of the end for Gus Winkler began upon Capone's 1931 imprisonment. With [[Frank Nitti]] now in charge of the mob, Winkler was surrounded by gangsters who he didn't trust. Nitti and other top Outfit mobsters had never been especially fond of the American Boys, whose rise to prominence was a product of Capone's generosity. After Nitti was shot and nearly killed by [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]] detective Harry Lang in December 1932, his suspicions towards Winkler only intensified. After Gus Winkler was observed making visits to the Bankers Building office of [[FBI]] agent [[Melvin Purvis]] in the summer of 1933, Nitti decided to act. While Winkler was only giving the feds tips on [[Kansas City Massacre]] suspect [[Verne Miller]], Nitti believed that he was turning informer.   

While entering the beer distribution office of Charles Weber at 1414 Roscoe Street on the afternoon of October 9, 1933, Winkler was hit by multiple shotgun blasts fired by unknown assailants hidden in the back of a green delivery truck. Winkler died a half-an-hour later after arriving at a local hospital. He was buried at Park Lawn Cemetery in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id174.htm |title=Gravesites 2 |author=Gomes, Mario |date= |website=MyAlCaponeMuseum.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler was one of the main casualties of a half-year-long purge where Frank Nitti eliminated the last of the so-called American Boys; including one of Winkler's alleged killers, Fred Goetz. Gus's wife, the former 'Georgette Bence' (1898-1962), would later write her memoirs in which she detailed her life with the notorious gangster.

==Other==
On February 29, 1960, while at his home in [[Florence, South Carolina]], former FBI agent Melvin Purvis died from a gunshot wound to the head fired from a [[M1911 pistol|.45 automatic]] given to him by fellow agents when he resigned from the Bureau. The FBI investigated his death and declared it a suicide, although the official coroner's report did not label the cause of death as such. A later investigation suggested that Purvis may have shot himself accidentally while trying to extract a tracer bullet jammed in the pistol. Later investigation revealed that the pistol that had taken Purvis's life had once belonged to none other than gangster Gus Winkler; the gun is believed to have been confiscated from Winkler during his debriefing at the Bankers Building in the summer of 1933.

'''Gustav Adolf Nosske''' (29 December 1902 – 1990) was a [[Germans|German]] [[lawyer]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]''.  In 1941 he commanded ''Einsatzkommando 12'' within [[Einsatzgruppe D]], under the command of [[Otto Ohlendorf]].

==Biography==
After studying law, the [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]-born Nosske became a lawyer. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in 1933.  He was the head of the [[Gestapo]] in [[Aachen]] in 1935 and then in [[Frankfurt]] from September 1936 to June 1941. He was appointed chief of ''Einsatzkommando 12'' before the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. In the areas of [[Donetsk]] and [[Novocherkassk]] his unit committed many atrocities against the civilian population. In mid-August 1941 [[Otto Ohlendorf]] ordered Nosske to transport 11,000 Jews from [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi]] to [[Yampil, Khmelnytskyi Oblast|Yampil]] in order to make them cross the [[Dniester]] River and place them in the Romanian zone.  During this walk hundreds of Jews were murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Ogorreck.  ''Les Einsatzgruppen'' ed. Calmann-Lévy 2007 p. 168 ISBN 978-2-286-03062-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 16 and 28 February 1942 ''Einsatzkommando 12'' killed 721 Jews, 271 communists, 74 partisans and 421 Roma.

In April 1942 Nosske joined the [[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt|RSHA]] office in [[Berlin]] concerning the Occupied Eastern Territories.  In 1943 he was appointed head of the &quot;Foreigners and Enemies of the State&quot; division of the Gestapo.  He worked as a [[liaison job|liaison]] between the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] and the RSHA.  From August 1943 to September 1944 he was head of the state police in [[Düsseldorf]].  He did not execute the order to collect all German Jews of Düsseldorf married to non-Jews for extermination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Stoltzfus]].  ''Resistance of the Heart: Intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse Protest in Nazi Germany'', Rutgers University Press, 2001, p. 256 ISBN 0-8135-2909-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosske was arrested by the Allies and brought to trial at the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial|''Einsatzgruppen'' Trial]] in 1948 at [[Nuremberg]].  He was the only accused who did not seek clemency from General [[Lucius D. Clay]] in the American sector of occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Richard Rhodes]] | year = 2002 | title = Masters of Death: The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust | publisher = Alfred A.

In 1951 his sentence was commuted to ten years in prison.  Upon returning to civilian life he became a coach in [[Württemberg]].  On 26 March 1965 he testified as a witness at the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]].  Nosske died in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;''This article incorporates information from the [[:fr:Gustav Adolf Nosske|corresponding article]] in the [[French Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustav Adolf Scheel''' (22 November 1907 – 25 March 1979) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physician]] and [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] politician. As a [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] member and ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' employee, he became a &quot;multifunctionary&quot; in the time of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], including posts as leader of both the [[National Socialist German Students' League]] and the [[German Student Union]], as an ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' commander in [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupied]] [[Alsace]], as well as ''[[Gauleiter]]'' and ''[[Reichsstatthalter]]'' in [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] from November 1941 until May 1945. As ''Einsatzgruppen'' commander, he organized in October 1940 the deportation of [[Karlsruhe]]'s [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jews]] to the [[extermination camp]]s in the east.

==Life==
Born as a Protestant pastor's son in [[Rosenberg (Baden)|Rosenberg]], North [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], Scheel  attended classical [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] schools in [[Freiburg]], [[Tauberbischofsheim]] and [[Mannheim]]. While still a schoolboy, he became involved in [[German nationalism|nationalist]] circles of the [[German Youth Movement]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] groups after World War I.

Beginning in the summer semester of 1928, he studied [[law]], political economy and [[theology]] at [[Heidelberg University]] to become a minister like his father. Scheel intensified his activities in right-wing student circles and in the winter semester of 1928-29 became a member of the ''[[Verein Deutscher Studenten]]'' (VDSt), an umbrella prganization of German ''[[Studentenverbindung]]'' fraternities. A year later he was the league's chairman.

==Nazi career==
In 1929 he joined the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB), on 1 October 1930 the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and on 1 December 1930 the Nazi Party (NSDAP). He moved for a short time to [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen University]] to begin studies in [[medicine]]. He continued his studies again in Heidelberg, where he quickly rose to become one of the main propagandists of the Nazis at the college. As NSDStB College Group Leader (''Hochschulgruppenführer''), he led the Nazi student rallies against the mathematics professor and pacifist [[Emil Julius Gumbel]] (1891–1966) which led to the removal of Gumbel's teaching entitlement in 1932.

In 1933, Scheel became chairman of the Heidelberg General Students' Board ([[AStA]]). During this time, he also became [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]]'s mentor, getting him to join the NSDAP and the SS. Furthermore, Scheel exerted influence over the university's appointments and personnel policy in his capacity as student leader and member of the vice chancellor's leadership staff. In May 1933, he was one of the main speakers at the Heidelberg [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]].

In 1934, Scheel sat his State medical examination, was appointed to the NSDStB leadership, and (in September) became a SS and a full-time ''Sicherheitsdienst'' (SD) employee. He rose swiftly in this secret Nazi organization. Between 1935 and 1939 he led the local SD Section Southwest in [[Stuttgart]] and, as a former student official, he brought along with him to the SD a great many young Nazi academics who went on to mass murder. Among them were [[Walter Stahlecker]], [[Martin Sandberger]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Weinmann|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Rapp|de}}, [[Erich Ehrlinger]], and [[Eugen Steimle]], all of whom went into various divisions of the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (RSHA) to become leaders of murder squads of the various ''Einsatzgruppen''.
[[File:G.A. Scheel (Prag 1939).jpg|thumb|Scheel speaking at the [[Charles University in Prague]], 1939]]
Scheel, who already in 1933 fought vehemently for the exclusion of &quot;students of Jewish lineage&quot; from the &quot;benefits of social institutions at the university&quot; became, upon the 1940 [[Battle of France]] became commander of the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' in Alsace. In October 1940, he organised the deportation of Karlsruhe's Jews to their certain deaths in the east.

Scheel's further rise within the Nazi repression apparatus kept on unabated. In 1941, he rose to the rank of a SS ''[[Brigadeführer]]'' and a Police Major General. [[SS and police leader]] ''Alpenland'' from 1 May 1941, he was installed as ''[[Gauleiter]]'' and Reich Governor (''Reichsstatthalter'') in the ''[[Reichsgau]]'' of Salzburg in November of the same year, succeeding [[Friedrich Rainer]]. After the discovery of [[German resistance to Nazism|resistance]] groups in Salzburg, he organized a widespread wave of arrests and had quite a few railwaymen put to death.

In 1943, he declared in his capacity as a student leader that the members of the [[White Rose]] (''Weiße Rose'') resistance group should be &quot;executed not as students&quot;, but rather as &quot;antisocial former [[Wehrmacht]] members&quot;. Scheel's point of view was that these &quot;criminals&quot; should not be allowed to stain the student body's image. From this time also came Scheel's declaration:

:&quot;German student, it is not necessary for you to live, but, to be sure, to fulfil your duty to your people.&quot;

Still in 1944, Scheel succeeded [[Walter Schultze]] as leader of the [[National Socialist German Lecturers League]] and was appointed member of the ''[[Reichsforschungsrat]]'' executive board. In August he was elevated to the rank of SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]''. As a Nazi &quot;multifunctionary&quot;, Scheel held the following functions (other than those mentioned above):
*Leader of the Heidelberg Student Body
*Honorary Senator of the [[University of Heidelberg]]
*Leader of the Berlin SD School
*Inspector of the Security Police and the SD in [[Stuttgart]]
*Leader of the Nazi Old Gentlemen's Federation
*Chairman of the Reich Student Works
*President of the German Study Works for Foreigners
*Member of the Reich Labour Chamber
*Commander of the Security Police and the SD under Chief of the civil administration in [[Alsace]]
*Member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]
*Leader of the SD Upper Division South (Munich)
*Inspector of the Security Police and the SD under the higher SS and Police leaders South and [[Main (river)|Main]]
*Higher SS and Police leader
*Leader of the [[SS-Oberabschnitt Alpenland]] (Salzburg)

As Nazi Germany's defeat loomed in 1944-45, Scheel was furthermore made leader of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' in the Gau of Salzburg. On 29 April 1945, [[Adolf Hitler]], in his will, assigned Scheel to the position of [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture|Reich Minister for Science, National Education and Culture]].

==After 1945==
After Salzburg's bloodless handover to the [[United States Army|Americans]] on 4 May, Scheel initially fled but ten days later placed himself to the disposal of the US forces and was interned. After spending time in many camps and prisons, he was released on 24 December 1947. After once again being interned, he was transferred to Heidelberg to undergo [[Denazification]]. A local court sentenced him in 1948 to five years in a labour camp, and classified him as a ''Hauptschuldiger'' (literally &quot;main culprit&quot;). He was however released on 24 December 1948 as a result of several testimonies in his defence stating that he had ignored Hitler's commands to defend the City of [[Salzburg]] against the approaching US forces.

Afterwards, he first worked as a night worker at the [[Port of Hamburg]], and as of summer 1949, he was a doctor in a Hamburg hospital, then an assistant doctor at Rautenberg Hospital in Hamburg.

After an appeal proceeding in 1952, Scheel was classified as a ''Belasteter'' (&quot;incriminated one&quot;). From 1951 to 1953, he belonged, along with other former Nazi leaders such as [[Werner Best]] and [[Werner Naumann]], to the [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] &quot;Naumann Circle&quot; and so was arrested in January 1953 by [[United Kingdom|British]] police, who suspected him of building up a secret organization; he was later handed over to German authorities. He was released on 17 June 1953. On 3 December 1954, his trial was suspended for lack of any adequate suspicion of wrongdoing. From February 1954 to 8 April 1977, he was the owner of a medical practice in Hamburg.

'''Gustav Laabs''' (born 20 December 1902-died 12 March 1980) was a German [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptscharführer]] and prior to that a ''Kriminalsekretär'' (Detective Sergeant). During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he worked as a [[gas van]] operator at the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] in [[Wartheland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;Krakowski, Shmuel (2007). Das Todeslager Chełmno, Kulmhof: der Beginn der ”Endlösung”. Göttingen: Wallstein Verlag. ISBN 978-3-8353-0222-8&lt;/ref&gt; Laabs died in 1980.

==Early life==
Laabs was born in Germany on 20 December 1902, little else is known of Laabs' life prior to the beginning of his military career.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

==Military career==

===Chełmno concentration camp===
Laabs was ordered to the Chełmno concentration camp where he served between April 1942 and January 1945, and started driving the [[Gas van|gas wagon]] within a few days of his arrival.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; He had earlier worked at the vehicle pool at the ''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'' (RSHA, the [[Reich Main Security Office]]) and had been transferred to a ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' in  [[Poznań|Posen]] (''Poznań'' in Polish); he had to agree to remain silent about his work there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh, Michael]] (2001). The Third Reich: A New History. London: Pan Books. ISBN 0-330-48757-4&lt;/ref&gt;

When Laabs went to the [[Gestapo]] headquarters in Posen, he was informed that he would start working at a [[Schutzstaffel#Special action units|''Sonderkommando'']] in Chełmno. The next day, he met [[Walter Burmeister]], who drove him and another [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-man, Oskar Hering, to Chełmno.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Montague, Patrick (2012). Chełmno and the Holocaust: A History of Hitler's First Death Camp. London: I.&amp;nbsp;B. Tauris. ISBN 978-0-8078-3527-2&lt;/ref&gt; The camp, located in [[Chełmno nad Nerem]], consisted of an old manor building and an area of about 3–4 kilometres of woods to the northwest of the manor building.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; The next day, SS-man [[Erwin Bürstinger]], who was responsible for the vehicles, showed Laabs and Hering the camp and told them to test drive the gas wagons.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;Curilla, Wolfgang. Der Judenmord in Polen und die Deutsche Ordnungspolizei 1939–1945. Paderborn: Schöningh. ISBN 978-3-506-77043-1&lt;/ref&gt;

In later court hearings, Laabs spoke about how the gassings were done. He drove the gas wagon alongside the manor building and about fifty Jews were brought into the wagon at a time. When it was full, the back door was locked.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt; A [[hose]] was connected between the gas wagon's exhaust and an opening in the wagon. Laabs was then told to start the engine and let it run; it took about 30 minutes until all the victims were dead. Laabs was then ordered to drive to a wooded area in the village of [[Koło]] to unload the bodies. A police officer went with Laabs, at first, to show him where to unload them: in a [[mass grave]] about three kilometres in.{{clarify|3Km into the wood?|date=December 2015}} Anyone who survived the asphyxiation was shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

===Demolition of mass graves===
In early 1942, the ''[[Standartenführer]]'' [[Paul Blobel]] was given a mission by [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to lead the [[Sonderaktion 1005|''Sonderaktion'' 1005]], which consisted of digging up the mass graves to burn the corpses.&lt;ref&gt;Szulc, Artur (2015). I skuggan av Auschwitz: Förintelsen 1939–45. Lund: Historiska Media. ISBN 9789175452371&lt;/ref&gt; Heydrich was murdered a few months later and the plans were halted.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; The following year ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] gave orders that all mass graves in Poland and the Soviet Union be demolished, leaving no traces of the mass murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; Blobel's work started in Chełmno, where they tried to destroy the [[Body snatching|exhumed bodies]] in fire bombings.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; The method proved ineffective and Blobel came up with the idea to burn the bodies in a large fire on iron bars. Laabs told in a later court hearing that the camp managers ordered a machine to grind down the bones following the cremations. The ashes of the bodies were poured into the [[Ner]] river. The area of the mass graves was destroyed and new trees were planted.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

===Chełmno trials===
At the end of November 1963, Laabs and ten other people from the Chełmno concentration camp [[Chełmno trials#Chełmno Trials in Germany 1962–65|were tried]] at the {{illm|Landgericht Bonn|de}} regional court. Laabs was indicted for the murder of 100,000 people in the gas van and for personally shooting the few survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1963/04/01/archive/five-month-chelmno-trial-ends-six-imprisoned-for-killing-jews|title=Five-month 'Chełmno Trial' Ends; Six Imprisoned for Killing Jews|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 1964, Laabs was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and lost 10 years of [[Civil and political rights|citizenship rights]] for his part in the [[Holocaust]]. His sentence was later reduced to 13 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

'''Gustav Lombard''' (10 April 1895 – 18 September 1992) was a high-ranking member in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] during [[World War II]]. During the war, Lombard commanded [[8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer]] and the [[31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division]]. He was a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] of [[Nazi Germany]] for so-called anti-partisan operations around [[Kovel]] which involved shooting civilians and burning down villages.

Lombard perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust, serving as commanding officer of the 1st Regiment of the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] during the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Lombard was convicted of war crimes by a Soviet military tribunal in 1947 and was released in 1955. He was subsequently tried by a West German court in the 1960s and found not guilty.

==Early life and SS career==
Lombard was born in Klein Spiegelberg, near [[Prenzlau]], [[Province of Brandenburg]]. After his father's death in 1906 he visited his relatives in the United States in 1913, where he graduated from high school and started studying Modern Languages at the [[University of Missouri]]. After the end of [[World War I]] he returned to Germany in Autumn 1919 and worked for [[American Express]] and the [[Chrysler|Chrysler Motor Company]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cüppers, „Vorreiter der Shoah, Ein Vergleich der Einsätze der beiden SS-Kavallerieregimenter im August 1941“ in Timm C. Richter: „Krieg und Verbrechen“, Meidenbauer Martin Verlag 2006, ISBN 3-89975-080-2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=aioKQyCatq4C&amp;pg=PA88]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombard joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) and [[SS]] after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of power]] in 1933 and became a member of SS – Cavalry. In his role as an instructor at the SS horse rider's club, he made the acquaintance of [[Jochen Peiper]], [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s future adjutant, with whom he was to remain in contact during and after World War II.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=11}}

After a short time in the [[Wehrmacht]] throughout the [[German invasion of Poland]] Lombard was promoted as Commander of the 3rd Squadron of the SS Totenkopf-Reiter-Standarte in December 1939 and in this function he was ordered on 7 April 1940 to occupy and hunt the district of Krolowiec near [[Warsaw]] in [[Poland]], where he gave order to kill any non-German male person between 17 and 60 years of age in the case of resistance. [[Hermann Fegelein]], the commander of the 1st SS Totenkopf-Reiter-Standarte, afterwards reported 250 executed persons throughout this deployment.

==Operation Barbarossa==

In the end of July 1941 Lombard was commander of a mounted detachment of the 1st SS Cavalry Regiment deployed east of [[Brest-Litovsk]], where he allegedly first used the term ”[[Entjudung]]” (De–jewification).

===&quot;Pripyat swamps&quot; punitive operation===

On 19 July 1941, by order of Himmler, the 1st and 2nd SS Cavalry Regiments were assigned to the general command of Higher SS and Police Leader [[Erich von dem Bach-Zalewski]]. Combined into the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] under the command of Hermann Fegelein, they were to take part in the action in the area of the [[Pinsk Marshes|Pripet marshes]], a large area of land that covered parts of [[Belorussia]] and the Northern [[Ukraine]]. This action became known as the [[Pripyat swamps (punitive operation)|&quot;Pripyat swamps&quot; punitive operation]] ({{lang-de|&quot;Pripiatsee&quot;}}); it was conducted by the combined SS and Wehrmacht forces in July and August 1941 as the &quot;systematic combing&quot; of the area for Jews, 'partisans' and Red Army stragglers. The beginning date of the operation is considered to be 28 July 1941.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=62, 79-80}}

General instructions were given to 'cleanse' the area of partisans and Jewish collaborators. Jewish women and children were to be driven away. Fegelein interpreted these orders as follows: Enemy soldiers in uniform were to be taken prisoner, and those found out of uniform were to be shot. Jewish males, with the exception of a few skilled workers such as doctors and leather workers, would be shot. Fegelein split the territory to be covered into two sections divided by the [[Pripyat River]], with Lombard's 1st Regiment taking the northern half and the 2nd Regiment the south, under the command of Franz Magill.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=80–81}}

On 1 August, Himmler met with Bach-Zelewski and Fegelein in Minsk, where Himmler ordered that 'all Jews must be shot. Drive female Jews into the swamps'. Following the meeting, Fegelein advised his men that Himmler told him that 'uncompromising severity' was necessary in dealing with the Jewish enemy. He reminded them that he would deal harshly with any commanders that showed weakness.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=81}} (Historian [[Peter Longerich]] notes that most orders to carry out criminal activities such as the killing of civilians were vague, and couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime. Leaders were given briefings that all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=189–190}})

The operation's command staff applied their own interpretation to the orders. On the evening of 1 August, Lombard informed his troops that 'in future not one male Jew is to remain alive, not one family in the villages.' In the following days, he &quot;detailed a new action in which ''all'' Jews, including women and children, were murdered with liberal use of automatic weapons&quot; (emphasis in the original).{{sfn|Beorn|2014|p=99}}{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=81-82}}

By 11 August Lombard reported that 11,000 men, women and children had been killed – more than 1,000 each day. His unit also killed 400 dispersed Soviet soldiers. Magill was apparently not as energetic, as, on 12 August, he had to explain that he had not completely eradicated the Jewish 'plunderers' because 'the swamps were not deep enough.'&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cüppers, &quot;Vorreiter der Shoah, Ein Vergleich der Einsätze der beiden SS-Kavallerieregimenter im August 1941&quot; in Timm C. Richter: &quot;Krieg und Verbrechen&quot;, Meidenbauer Martin Verlag 2006, ISBN 3-89975-080-2&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=81-82}}

By 13 August, the combined forces reported 13,788 'plunderers' killed, with only 714 taken prisoner. At the same time, the entire SS cavalry brigade of 4,000 strong suffered 2 casualties dead and 15 wounded. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=119–120}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=310}} The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|p=120}} Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in [[the Holocaust]] to wipe out entire Jewish communities.{{sfn|Pieper|2015|pp=86, 88–89}}

Lombard's zeal and initiative were noted as he was promoted to regimental commander, while Magill was not and saw himself soon reassigned to an unimportant posting.{{sfn|Beorn|2014|p=99}}{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=81-82}} On 3 September 1941, Lombard was awarded [[Iron Cross]] 1st class for 'bravery in battle'.

===Mogilev conference===

Despite low threat from insurgents in the rear in the first months of the invasion, Wehrmacht's aggressive rear security doctrine and the use of the civilian 'danger' as a cover for genocidal policies resulted in close cooperation between the army and the security apparatus behind the front lines. One of the examples of such cooperation was a three-day field conference organized in the town of [[Mogilev]] by General [[Max von Schenckendorff]], chief of Army Group Center's rear area, to create an 'exchange of experiences' for the benefit of Wehrmacht's rear unit commanders. Participating officers were selected based on their 'achievements' in operations already undertaken.{{sfn|Boog|Förster|Hoffmann|Klink|1998|pp=1204-05}}{{sfn|Beorn|2014|pp=95-96}}

The conference got underway on 24 September and focused on 'combatting partisans' (''Bekämpfung von Partisanen''). Talks presented included the evaluation of Soviet 'bandit' organisation and tactics; why it was necessary to execute political commissars immediately upon capture; and the connection between Jews and partisans. In addition to Lombard, the speakers included: Higher SS and Police Leader [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]]; Max Montua, commander of Police Regiment Center; Hermann Fegelein, commander of the SS Cavalry Brigade; [[Arthur Nebe]], commander of ''[[Einsatzgruppe]]'' B; and others.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=167}}{{sfn|Beorn|2014|pp=99-101}}

The conference included three field exercises. On the second day, participants traveled to the settlement of Knyazhichi (Knjaschitschi in the German rendering). According to the after-action report, 'suspicious strangers' (''Ortsfremde''), that is 'partisans', could not be found, but the screening of the population revealed 51 Jewish civilians; of these, 32 were shot. Thus the conference participants were presented with the default targeting of Jews as part of the anti-partisan warfare. The conference, while ostensibly an 'anti-partisan training', was in fact a means 'to promote the annihilation of Jews for racial reasons', as a post-war West German court put it. The conference marked a dramatic increase in the violence against Jews and other civilians in the last three months of 1941.{{sfn|Beorn|2014|pp=101-106}}

==Later war==

On 15 January 1944, Lombard was appointed Chief of Staff of ''Stossgruppe von dem Bach'', a rapid deployment assault unit under the command of Bach-Zalewski. Established to defend [[Kovel]], the unit was composed of the 17th SS Cavalry Regiment, and army artillery, pioneer and assault-gun detachments. Through March 1944, the unit conducted defensive operations and counter-strokes against both partisan formations in the rear and the Red Army forces trying to encircle the city. During the Kovel operations, SS troops and police allegedly perpetrated atrocities in the surrounding area, shooting civilians and burning down villages.{{sfn|Blood|2006|p=225-227}}

==Post-war==
Lombard became a prisoner of war in the [[Soviet Union]] in April 1945 and was sentenced as a war criminal to 25 years in prison in 1947. In 1955 he returned to [[West Germany]] after Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] negotiated the release of the remaining German POWs and war criminals from the Soviet Union. He was tried by a West German court in the 1960s; the court case lasted a decade and did not result in a conviction.

Lombard worked for the [[Allianz]] Insurance company in [[Munich]] and died in [[Mühldorf am Inn]] at the age of 97.

''[[SS-Unterscharführer]]'' '''Gustav Münzberger''' (17 August 1903 – 23 March 1977), born in [[Novosedlice|Weißkirchlitz]] (''Sudetenland''), was a carpenter and factory worker before the [[Holocaust]]. Following the Nazi German [[invasion of Poland]] at the onset of World War II he was posted as a serviceman in August 1940 at the [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre]] at [[Schloss Sonnenstein]] in [[Pirna]]. He arrived at the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in late September 1942 and became assistant to deputy commandant ''[[SS-Oberscharführer]]'' [[Heinrich Matthes]], in charge of leading [[Jews]] into the gas chambers and gassing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathcamps-Münzberger&quot;/&gt;

Treblinka was built as part of the most deadly phase of the [[Final Solution]], known as [[Operation Reinhard]]. The camp operated between {{Dts|1942|July|23|format=dmy}} and {{Dts|1943|October|19|format=dmy}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holocaustresearchproject.net&quot;&gt;[http://www.holocaustresearchproject.net/ar/treblinkadaytoday.html Treblinka Death Camp Day-by-Day] Holocaust Education &amp; Archive Research Team, H.E.A.R.T.

Münzberger was an operator of the gas chambers at the ''Totenlager'', and later Chief of the ''Leichentransportkommando'' corpse transport team. On 21 June 1943 he was promoted from the rank of ''SS-Rottenführer'' to the rank of ''SS-Unterscharführer''. During the Treblinka revolt he was on holiday at home. After the closure of Treblinka, he was sent to [[Trieste#World War II and its aftermath|Trieste in Italy]] at the end of November or early December 1943. The [[Risiera di San Sabba]] killing centre was being set up there. Münzberger was arrested twenty years later in West Germany on 13 July 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathcamps-Münzberger&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathcamps.org/treblinka/perpetrators.html|title=MÜNZBERGER, Gustav; SS-Unterscharführer, SS-Number: 321 758|publisher=ARC Death Camps.org |work=The Treblinka Perpetrators.

He was charged with war crimes at the [[Treblinka trials]] lasting from 12 October 1964 till 24 August 1965, and sentenced for 12 years imprisonment. He served six years and was released on good behavior in 1971. He died six years later.&lt;ref name=Trial&gt;S.J.

In April 1941, Richter was sent to [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], as the adviser on Jewish Affairs. He collaborated closely with the German Ambassador to [[Romania]], [[Manfred Freiherr von Killinger]].

After visiting [[Berlin]] in September 1941, Richter returned to Romania, where he was until August 1944. It was Richter who insisted on the reintroduction of repressive measures. On 3 September 1941, it was by his order that wearing the yellow badge was re-endorsed.

Richter's primary task was to take a census of all the Jews in Romania. He planned the ghettoization and ultimate extermination of 300,000 Romanian Jews, after their deportation to the [[Belzec extermination camp]] in occupied [[Poland]]. His other task was to prevent even the emigration of Jewish children from Romania to [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate Palestine]] (region)|Palestine]].

On 22 July 1942, Richter received permission from both Romania's [[Conducator]] (head of state) [[Ion Antonescu]] and [[Foreign Minister]] [[Mihai Antonescu]], to deport the Romanian Jews to Belzec. However, while hundreds of thousands{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} of Jews were killed{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} in Romania, in general, Richter's plan to deport them to Belzec fell through.

Richter did manage to prevent the emigration of deportees, particularly orphans from [[Transnistria]], to Palestine, in accordance with the detailed instructions he received directly from Eichmann and the German Foreign Ministry.

On 23 August 1944, the Romanian royalist forces under King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] (King Mihai) staged a [[King Michael Coup|coup]], deposed the government of [[Ion Antonescu]] (Romania's military dictator), quit the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]], and joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Richter found himself besieged in the German embassy in Bucharest by royalist forces. He was captured by the Romanians and delivered to the Soviet Red Army forces.

==Prisoner of war==
On 21 January 1945, while in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] custody immediately following [[World War II]], Richter shared a prison cell with [[Raoul Wallenberg]] at [[Lubyanka prison]].  On 1 March 1945, Richter was moved from his cell and he never saw Wallenberg again.  Richter testified in Sweden in 1955 that Wallenberg was interrogated at least once by the Soviets for about an hour-and-a-half.  According to Richter, this interrogation took place in early February 1945.

After several years in prisoner-of-war camps in the [[Soviet Union]], Richter was tried and convicted of war crimes in 1951. He was transferred to Western Germany in 1955. Preparations for Richter's trial began in Germany in 1961. But the trial did not begin until December 1981. The basis for Richter's conviction was the plan, signed by him, to deport Romanian Jewry to Belzec.  In early 1982, Richter was sentenced to four years of imprisonment but was released on the basis that he had already spent time in prison whilst in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/12/world/ex-nazi-officer-convicted.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustav Hermann Sorge''' (April 24, 1911, [[Rydzyna|Reisen]], [[Province of Posen]] – 1978, [[Rheinbach|Rheinbach, prison]]), nicknamed &quot;''Der eiserne Gustav''&quot; (The Iron Gustav) for his brutality, was an [[SS]]-[[Hauptscharführer]] and a guard at [[KZ Esterwegen|Esterwegen]] concentration camp in the [[Emsland]] region of Germany prior to being assigned to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] concentration camp.

Among the many people who were murdered at Sachsenhausen by Sorge was Leon Sternbach, a professor of classical philology at [[Jagiellonian University]] and the paternal uncle of famed chemist [[Leo Sternbach]].
Sorge became a prisoner of war of the [[U.S.S.R.]] after the war, was tried as a war criminal in the Sachsenhausen trial held in the former city hall of Berlin-Pankow in 1947 along with Sachsenhausen commandant [[Anton Kaindl]], prison block director [[Kurt Eccarius]] and others, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Sorge was subsequently  repatriated to [[West Germany]] in 1956 on the condition that he continue to serve the life sentence imposed by the Soviets.  He was put on trial with fellow SS guard Wilhelm Schubert in [[Bonn]] (West Germany) for the 1941 murders of over 13,000 Soviet prisoners of war, many of whom where invalided at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The murders were carried out on a daily basis for six weeks. The retrial was ordered by the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Justice of Germany]] to assuage public conscience that the original verdicts in 1947 were indeed warranted. He was convicted of 67 individual murders and numerous counts of manslaughter and resentenced to a life term. He was sent to Rheinbach prison near Bonn,&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich persons: who came before and after 1945.

Due to his brutality, he was known as &quot;'''The Beast'''&quot; and &quot;'''Wolf'''&quot;.{{r|Klee1991}}

==Biography==
Born in [[Vienna]], Wagner joined the Nazi Party in 1931 as member number 443,217.  After being arrested for proscribed National Socialist agitation, he fled to Germany, where he joined the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and later the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name=Reich&gt;Christian Zentner, Friedemann Bedürftig.  ''The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 1,014.  Macmillan, New York, 1991.  ISBN 0-02-897502-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1940, Wagner was part of the [[Action T4]] euthanasia program at [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre|Hartheim]] with administrative functions .{{r|Klee2011}}  Due to his experience in T4, Wagner was assigned to help establish the [[Sobibór extermination camp]] in March 1942.  Once the gassing installations were completed, Wagner became deputy commandant of the camp under Commandant [[Franz Stangl]].&lt;ref name=Reich/&gt;  His official title was quartermaster-sergeant of the camp.&lt;ref name=SobiborInterview&gt;[http://www.sobiborinterviews.nl/en/extermination-camp/biographies-of-ss-men Sobibor Interviews: Biographies of SS-men]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arad&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Yitzhak |author-link=Yitzhak Arad |year=1987 |title=Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21305-3 |pp=191–2 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagner was in charge of selecting which prisoners from the newly arrived transports would be used as slave laborers in and outside the camp, and which would be sent to their deaths in the gas chambers.{{r|Reich|SobiborInterview}}  When Wagner was on vacation or attending to duties elsewhere, [[Karl Frenzel]] assumed his role within the camp.

More than any other officer at Sobibór, Wagner was responsible for the daily interactions with prisoners.  Wagner supervised the routine and daily life at Sobibór, and he was one of the most brutal SS officers.  Survivors of the camp described him as a cold-blooded sadist.&lt;ref name=Reich/&gt;  Wagner was known to beat and thrash camp inmates on a regular basis, and to kill Jews without reason or restraint. Inmate [[Moshe Bahir]] described him:{{r|Arad}}
{{Quote|text=He was a handsome man, tall and blond — a pure [[Aryan]].  In civilian life he was, no doubt, a well-mannered man; at Sobibor he was a wild beast.  His lust to kill knew no bounds... He would snatch babies from their mothers' arms and tear them to pieces in his hands.  I saw him beat two men to death with a rifle, because they did not carry out his instructions properly, since they did not understand German.  I remember that one night a group of youths aged fifteen or sixteen arrived in the camp.  The head of this group was one Abraham.  After a long and arduous work day, this young man collapsed on his pallet and fell asleep.  Suddenly Wagner came into our barrack, and Abraham did not hear him call to stand up at once before him.  Furious, he pulled Abraham naked off his bed and began to beat him all over his body.  When Wagner grew weary of the blows, he took out his revolver and killed him on the spot.  This atrocious spectacle was carried out before all of us, including Abraham's younger brother.}}

[[Erich Bauer]] would later remark:{{sfn|Klee|Dressen|Riess|1991|p=232}}
{{Quote|text=I estimate that the number of Jews gassed at Sobibor was about 350,000. In the canteen at Sobibor I once overheard a conversation between [[Karl Frenzel]], [[Franz Stangl]] and Gustav Wagner. They were discussing the number of victims in the extermination camps of [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Treblinka]] and [[Sobibor]] and expressed their regret that Sobibor &quot;came last&quot; in the competition.}}

Inmate [[Eda Lichtman]] wrote that on the Jewish fast day of [[Yom Kippur]], Wagner appeared at roll call, selected some prisoners, gave them bread and forced them to eat it.  As the prisoners ate the bread, Wagner laughed loudly, enjoying his joke because he knew that these Jews were pious.{{r|Arad}}

One of the Sobibór prisoners improvised a song which ironically described camp life (original text with English translation):

{{Div col|cols=2|rules=yes|gap=4em}}
{{unbulleted list
|''Wie lustig ist da unser Leben''
|''Man tut uns zu essen geben''
|''Wie lustig ist im grünen Wald''
|''Wo ich mir aufhalt''
|''How fun is our life there,''
|''They give us food to eat that's fair,''
|''What fun it is in the green wood,''
|''Where I am stood.''
}}
{{Div col end}}

Wagner enjoyed this song and he forced the prisoners to sing it frequently.{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=230}}

After two Jews escaped from Sobibór in the spring of 1943, Wagner was put in charge of a squad of soldiers from the Wehrmacht, who laid minefields around the camp so as to prevent further escapes.  However, these efforts did not prevent another escape, which took form in the Sobibór revolt.  Wagner was not present at the camp on the day of the Sobibór revolt (14 October 1943).  The inmates knew of Wagner's absence and believed that it would improve their chances of success.  Wagner was considered the strictest in terms of prisoner supervision at the camp.  After the successful revolt, Wagner was ordered to aid in closing the camp.  He helped to dismantle and remove evidence of the camp by ruthlessly commanding the Jewish prisoners who performed this task.  For instance, after the ''Arbeitsjuden'' (&quot;worker Jews&quot;) had been transported from [[Treblinka]] and had successfully torn down the Sobibór barracks, Wagner killed them.{{r|SobiborInterview}}

[[Heinrich Himmler]] considered Wagner to be &quot;one of the most deserving men of [[Operation Reinhard]]&quot; ({{lang-de|einer der verdientesten Männer der Aktion Reinhard}}).&lt;ref name=Klee2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klee |first1=Ernst |author-link=Ernst Klee |year=2011 |title=Das Personen Lexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945? |location=Koblenz |publisher=Edition Kramer |isbn=978-398114834-3 |p=649 |language=de |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sobibór, Wagner was transferred to Italy, where he participated in the deportation of Jews.{{r|Reich}}

==After World War II==
Gustav Wagner was [[sentenced to death]] ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', but escaped with [[Franz Stangl]] to [[Brazil]].  Clergy at the ''Collegio Teutonico di Santa Maria dell'Anima'' in Rome [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)#Roman ratlines|assisted Wagner]] in his flight from justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walters |first=Guy |year=2010 |title=Hunting Evil |location=London |publisher=Bantam Books |p=240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wagner was admitted as a permanent resident on 12 April 1950 and  on {{Dts|1950|December|4|format=dmy}} a Brazilian passport was issued in the name of &quot;Günther Mendel&quot;, his new identity.&lt;ref name=Blatt/&gt; He lived in Brazil undisturbed until he was exposed by [[Simon Wiesenthal]] and arrested on 30 May 1978. [[Extradition]] requests from [[Israel]], Austria and Poland were rejected by Brazil's Attorney General. On 22 June 1979 the Brazilian Supreme Court also rejected a [[West Germany|West German]] extradition request.{{r|SobiborInterview|Arad}}

Wagner, in a 1979 [[BBC]] interview, showed no [[remorse]] for his activities in running the camp, remarking:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bower |first=Tom |date=19 August 1979 |title=The Tracking And Freeing Of a Nazis Killer |others=(reprinted from a BBC television program) |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1979/08/19/the-tracking-and-freeing-of-a-nazis-killer/c50b9591-da25-485e-a579-b56d8d8708eb/?utm_term=.fdc7f59309f7  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=I had no feelings. ... It just became another job. In the evening we never discussed our work, but just drank and played cards.}}
In October 1980, Wagner was found with a knife in his chest in [[São Paulo]]. According to his attorney, Wagner committed [[suicide]]. His date of death was determined to be 3 October 1980.{{r|SobiborInterview|Arad}}

'''Gustave Mark Gilbert''' (September 30, 1911 – February 6, 1977) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] best known for his writings containing observations of high-ranking [[Nazism|Nazi]] leaders during the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. His ''Psychology of Dictatorship'' was an attempt to profile Adolf Hitler using as reference the testimonials of Hitler’s closest generals and commanders. Gilbert’s published work is still a subject of study in many universities and colleges, especially in the field of psychology.

==Early life==
Gustave Gilbert was born in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1911, the son of [[Jewish]]-[[Austria]]n [[immigrant]]s. He won a [[scholarship]] from the School for Ethical Culture at the College Town Center in New York. In 1939, Gilbert obtained his [[Ph.D.]] in [[Psychology]] from [[Columbia University]]. Gilbert also held a diploma from the [[American Board of Examiners]] in Professional Psychology.

During [[World War II]] Gilbert was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a military psychologist with the rank of [[First Lieutenant]]. Because of his knowledge of [[German language|German]], he was sent overseas as a military [[intelligence officer]].

==Nuremberg trials==
[[File:GustaveGilbertNuremberg.jpg|thumb|Captain Gilbert talks with [[Hermann Göring|Göring]], [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] and [[Rudolf Hess|Hess]] during a court recess.]]

In 1945, after the end of the war, Gilbert was sent to [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]], as a [[translator]] for the [[International Military Tribunal]] for the trials of the World War II German prisoners. Gilbert was appointed the Prison Psychologist of the German prisoners. During the process of the trials Gilbert became, after Dr [[Douglas Kelley]],&lt;ref&gt;Jack El-Hai : ''The Nazi and the Psychiatrist: Hermann Göring, Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, and a Fatal Meeting of Minds at the End of WWII'', Publisher: PublicAffairs, 2013, ISBN 161039156X&lt;/ref&gt; the confidant of [[Hermann Göring]], [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], [[Wilhelm Keitel]], [[Hans Frank]], [[Oswald Pohl]], [[Otto Ohlendorf]], [[Rudolf Höss]], and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], among others. At first he did not tell them he was Jewish; after he told them, most of the prisoners did not mind talking to him. Gilbert and Kelley administered the [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblot test]] to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group prior to the first set of trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/nazi-criminals-were-given-rorschach-tests-nuremberg-psychology-332641?rm=eu|title=Nazi Criminals Were Given Rorschach Tests at Nuremberg|publisher=europe.newsweek.com|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert also participated in the Nuremberg Trials as the American Military Chief Psychologist and provided testimony attesting the sanity of [[Rudolf Hess]].

In 1946, after the trials, Gilbert returned to the USA. Gilbert stayed busy teaching, researching, and writing. In 1947 he published part of his diary, consisting of observations taken during interviews, interrogations, “eavesdropping” and conversations with German prisoners, under the title ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''. (This diary was reprinted in full in 1961 just before the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Jerusalem]].) The following is a famous exchange Gilbert had with Göring from this book:

:'''Göring:''' Why, of course, the ''people'' don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in [[England]], nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the ''leaders'' of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a [[democracy]], or a [[fascist]] dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.

:'''Gilbert:''' There is one difference. In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only [[United States Congress|Congress]] can declare wars.

:'''Göring:''' Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the [[pacifism|pacifists]] for lack of [[patriotism]] and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

==Later life==
In 1948, as Head Psychologist at the Veterans Hospital at Lyons, NJ, Gilbert treated veterans of World Wars [[World War I|I]] and II who had suffered [[nervous breakdown]]s.

In 1950, Gilbert published ''The Psychology of Dictatorship; Based on an examination of the leaders of Nazi Germany.'' In this book, Gilbert made an attempt to portray a profile of the psychological behavior of [[Adolf Hitler]], based on [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] work from eyewitness reports from Hitler’s commanders in prison in Nuremberg.

In September 1954, while he was an Associate Professor of Psychology at [[Michigan State College]], Gilbert attended the 62nd Annual Convention of the [[American Psychological Association]] in New York. Gilbert was part of a four-person panel discussing “Psychological Approaches to the Problem of Anti-Intellectualism.”

In 1961, when he was the chairman of the Psychology Department of [[Long Island University]] in [[Brooklyn]], Gilbert was summoned to testify in the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem. Gilbert testified on 29 May 1961, describing how both [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] and [[Rudolf Höss]] tried in their conversations with him to put the responsibility for the [[The Holocaust|extermination of the Jews]] on each other's doorstep. Nevertheless, Eichmann appeared in the accounts of both men. Then he presented a document, handwritten by Höss, that surveys the process of extermination at [[Auschwitz]] and different sums of people gassed there – under Höss as commandant and according to an oral report by Eichmann. The court decided not to accept Gilbert's psychological analyses of the prisoners at Nuremberg as part of his testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/Sessions/index-03.html | title = Transcript of the trial of Adolf Eichmann | volume = III}} (Sessions 55, 56 and 57 contains the testimony of Dr. Gilbert) from the [[Nizkor Project]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Gilbert convinced Leon Pomeroy, Ph.D., then a recent graduate from [[University of Texas at Austin]], to build a clinical doctoral program in the field of psychology at Long Island University. At the time, Gilbert was serving as chairman of the Psychology Department of Long Island University in Brooklyn, New York.
 
Gustave Mark Gilbert died on 6 February 1977.

'''Gustavo Romero Tercero''' (born 1970), also known as &quot;The Valdepeñas Killer&quot;, is a Spanish armed robber and rapist. He killed a couple after the woman recognized him in 1993 and another woman in 1998 after accidentally hitting her with his car, fearing that a possible investigation would link him to the other crimes. He confessed and was sentenced to 103 years in prison in 2003, after his ex-wife denounced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/04/21/sociedad/1114074425.html | title=ondenan a 103 años de prisión a Gustavo Romero por el asesinato de tres personas en Valdepeñas | publisher=El Mundo | date=April 22, 2005 | accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Augustus Andrew &quot;Gusty&quot; Spence''' (28 June 1933&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/people/biography/speople.htm Biographies of people prominent during 'the Troubles': S]. ''[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN). Retrieved 5 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; – 25 September 2011) was a leader of the paramilitary [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and a leading [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[politician]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. One of the first UVF members to be convicted of murder, Spence was a senior figure in the organisation for over a decade.

During his time in prison Spence renounced violence and helped to convince a number of fellow inmates that the future of the UVF lay in a more political approach. Spence joined the [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (PUP), becoming a leading figure in the group. As a PUP representative he took a principal role in delivering the loyalist ceasefires of 1994.

==Early years==
Spence was born in the [[Shankill Road, Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], the son of William Edward Spence, who was born in [[Whitehaven]], [[England]] and raised in the Tiger's Bay area of north Belfast before moving to the Shankill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland6&quot;&gt;Garland, ''Gusty Spence'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; William Edward Spence was a member of the [[Ulster Volunteers]] and had fought in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hennessey, ''Northern Ireland: The Origin of the Troubles'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 2005, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; He married Isabella &quot;Bella&quot; Hayes, Gusty Spence's mother, in 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland6&quot;/&gt; Spence was the sixth of seven children, their birth order being Billy, Cassie, Jim, Bobby, Ned junior, Gusty and Lily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland5&quot;/&gt; The family home was 66 Joseph Street in an area of the lower Shankill known colloquially as &quot;the Hammer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland5&quot;&gt;[[Roy Garland]], ''Gusty Spence'', Belfast: Blackstaff Press, 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the Riddel School on Malvern Street and the Hemsworth Square school, both on the Shankill, finishing his education aged fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, ''Gusty Spence'', pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade|Church Lads' Brigade]], a [[Church of Ireland]] group, and the Junior [[Orange Order]].&lt;ref&gt;Garland, ''Gusty Spence'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; His family had a long tradition of Orange Order membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce15&quot;&gt;Steve Bruce, ''The Red Hand'', Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence took various manual jobs in the area until joining the [[British Army]] in 1957 as a member of the [[Royal Ulster Rifles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;/&gt; Spence rose to the rank of military police sergeant.&lt;ref name=&quot;UVF20&quot;&gt;Jim Cusack &amp; Henry McDonald, ''UVF'', Dublin: Poolbeg, 1997, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the army until 1961 when ill-health forced him to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;/&gt; Spence was stationed in [[Cyprus]] during his time in the army and saw action fighting against the forces of Colonel [[Georgios Grivas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moloney130&quot;&gt;Moloney, ''Paisley'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the army Spence found employment at the [[Harland &amp; Wolff]] shipyard in Belfast where he worked as a stager (builder of the scaffolding in which the ships are constructed), a skilled job that commanded respect amongst working class Protestants and ensured for Spence a higher status within the Shankill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce15&quot;/&gt;

From an early age Spence was a member of the Prince Albert Temperance [[Loyal Orange Lodge]], where fellow members included [[John McQuade]].&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, ''Paisley'', pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Royal Black Institution]] and the [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan McKay, ''Northern Protestants: An Unsettled People'',Belfast: Blackstaff Press, 2005, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his later involvement in a murder he was expelled from the Orange Order and the Royal Black Institution, although it is unknown whether the Apprentice Boys of Derry took any disciplinary action. The Reverend [[Martin Smyth]] was influential in the expulsion of Spence by the Orange Order.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Kennaway ''The Orange Order-A Tradition Betrayed'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

His older brother [[Billy Spence]] was a founding member of [[Ulster Protestant Action]] (UPA) in 1956&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, ''Paisley'', pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; and Gusty Spence himself was also a member of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce15&quot;/&gt; He was frequently involved in street fights with republicans and garnered a reputation as a &quot;hard man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UVF20&quot;/&gt; He was also associated loosely with prominent loyalists such as [[Ian Paisley]] and [[Desmond Boal]] and was advised by both men in 1959 when he launched a protest against [[Gerry Fitt]] at [[Belfast City Hall]] after Fitt had described Spence's regiment as &quot;murderers&quot; over allegations that they had killed civilians in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moloney132&quot;/&gt; Spence, along with other Shankill Road loyalists, broke from Paisley in 1965 when they sided with [[Jim Kilfedder]] in a row that followed the latter's campaigns in [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]]. Paisley had intimated that Kilfedder, a rival for the leadership of dissident unionism, was close to [[Fine Gael]] after learning that he had attended party meetings while a student at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. The Shankill loyalists supported Kilfedder and following his election as MP sent a letter to Paisley accusing him of treachery during the entire affair.&lt;ref&gt;Moloney, ''Paisley'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ulster Volunteer Force==
Spence had claimed that he was approached in 1965 by two men, one of whom was an [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MP, who told him that the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] was to be re-established and that he was to have responsibility for the Shankill. He was sworn in soon afterwards in a ceremony held in secret near [[Pomeroy, County Tyrone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hen55&quot;&gt;Hennessey, ''Northern Ireland'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his military experience Gusty Spence was chosen as the military commander and public face of the UVF when the group was established although [[RUC Special Branch]] believed that his brother Billy, who kept a much lower public profile, was the real leader of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moloney130&quot;/&gt; Whatever the truth of this intelligence, Gusty Spence's Shankill UVF team was made up of only around 12 men on its formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hen55&quot;/&gt; Their base of operations was the Standard Bar, a pub on the Shankill Road frequented by Spence and his allies (it was normal practice for UVF &quot;teams&quot; to be based at a single pub that its members used socially).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce147&quot;/&gt;

On 7 May 1966, a group of UVF men led by Spence [[petrol bomb]]ed a Catholic-owned pub on the Shankill Road. Fire also engulfed the house next door, killing the elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould (77), who lived there.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN 1966&quot;&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch1800-1967.htm A Chronology of Key Events in Irish History 1800 to 1967]&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May, Spence ordered four UVF men to kill an [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) member, Leo Martin, who lived on the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]]. Unable to find their target, the men drove around in search of any Catholic instead. They shot dead John Scullion (28), a Catholic civilian, as he walked home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon&quot;&gt;Dillon, Martin. ''The Shankill butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder''. Routledge, 1999. Pages 20–23&lt;/ref&gt; Spence later wrote &quot;at the time, the attitude was that if you couldn't get an IRA man you should shoot a [[Taig]], he's your last resort&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon&quot;/&gt; On 26 June, the same gang shot dead Catholic civilian Peter Ward (18) and wounded two others as they left a pub on Malvern Street, Belfast.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN 1966&quot;/&gt; Two days later, the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]] declared the UVF illegal.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN 1966&quot;/&gt; Shortly after, Spence and three others were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Taylor (Journalist) | title = Loyalists | publisher = [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] | year = 1999 | pages = 44 | doi = | isbn = 0-7475-4519-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1966, Spence was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Peter Ward, although Spence has always claimed he was innocent.&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;/&gt; He was sent to [[Crumlin Road (HM Prison)|Crumlin Road Prison]]. During its [[The Twelfth|12 July]] 1967 march, the Orange lodge to which he belonged stopped outside the prison in tribute to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;mckay&quot;&gt;McKay, Susan. [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/people/accounts/mckay00.htm#portadown &quot;Portadown: Bitter Harvest&quot;]. ''Northern Protestants: An Unsettled People''. Blackstaff Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred despite Spence having been officially expelled from the Orange Order following his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, ''Gusty Spence'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Spence's involvement in the killings gave him legendary status among many young loyalists and he was claimed as an inspiration by the likes of [[Michael Stone (loyalist)|Michael Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Dillon, ''Stone Cold'', London: Arrow Books, 1993, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Pat Coogan]] has described Spence as a &quot;loyalist folk hero&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Pat Coogan]], ''The Troubles'', London: Hutchinson, 1995, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was however repudiated by Ian Paisley and condemned in his ''[[Protestant Telegraph]]'', sealing the earlier split between the two.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], ''Loyalists'', London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2000, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==In prison==
Spence appealed against his conviction and was the subject of a release petition organised by the [[Ulster Constitution Defence Committee]], although nothing came of either initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Loyalists'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that control of the UVF lay (nominally at least) with Spence's closest ally [[Samuel McClelland|Samuel &quot;Bo&quot; McClelland]], from prison Spence was often at odds with the group's leadership, in particular with regards to the 1971 [[McGurk's Bar bombing]]. Spence now argued that UVF members were soldiers and soldiers should not kill civilians, as had been the case at McGurk's Bar.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Loyalists'', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cusack &amp; McDonald, ''UVF'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Spence respected [[Irish republican]] paramilitaries, who he felt also lived as soldiers, and to this end he wrote a sympathetic letter to the widow of [[Official IRA]] leader [[Joe McCann]] after he was killed in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Loyalists'', p. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fugitive===
Spence was granted two days leave around 1 July 1972 to attend the wedding of his daughter Elizabeth to [[Winston Churchill Rea|Winston Churchill &quot;Winkie&quot; Rea]]. The latter had formally asked Spence for his daughter's hand in marriage during a prison visit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor110&quot;&gt;Taylor. ''Loyalists''. pp.110–111&lt;/ref&gt; Met by two members of the [[Red Hand Commando]] upon his release, Spence was informed of the need for a restructuring within the UVF, and told not to return to prison. He initially refused and went on to attend his daughter's wedding. Afterwards a plot was concocted where his nephew [[Frankie Curry]], also a UVF member, would drive Spence back to jail but the car would be stopped and Spence &quot;kidnapped&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor110&quot;/&gt; As arranged, the car in which Spence was a passenger was stopped on the Springmartin Road and Spence was taken away by UVF members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor110&quot;/&gt; He remained at large for four months and during that time even gave an interview to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[World in Action]]'' in which he called for the UVF to take an increased role in the Northern Ireland conflict against the Provisional IRA while also distancing himself from any policy of random murders of Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor. ''Loyalists''. pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; He also took on responsibility for the restructuring, returning the UVF to the same command structure and organisational base that [[Edward Carson]] had utilised for the original UVF, with brigades, battalions, companies, platoons, and sections. He also directed a significant restocking of the group's arsenal, with guns mostly taken from the [[security forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor112&quot;&gt;Taylor, ''Loyalists'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;  Spence gave his permission for UVF brigadier [[Billy Hanna]] to establish the UVF's [[UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade|Mid-Ulster Brigade]] in [[Lurgan]], and endorsed Hanna as commander of the unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiernan&quot;&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/sunningdale-pushed-hardliners-into-fatal-outrages-in-1974-519004.html &quot;Sunningdale pushed hard-liners into fatal outrages in 1974&quot;. ''Irish Independent''. Joe Tiernan. 16 May 1999] Retrieved 10 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His fugitive status earned him the nickname &quot;the Orange Pimpernel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Burleigh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gSa6U9DmMDUC&amp;pg=PA297 Blood and rage: a cultural history of terrorism]&lt;/ref&gt; Spence was arrested along with around thirty other men at a UVF drinking club on Brennan Street during his spell at large but, after giving a false name and details, he was released.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, ''The Red Hand'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence's time on the outside came to an end on 4 November when he was captured by Colonel [[Derek Wilford]] of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], who identified Spence by tattoos on his hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor112&quot;/&gt; He was returned to Crumlin Road gaol soon afterwards, where he shared a cell with [[William Smith (loyalist)|William &quot;Plum&quot; Smith]], one of the Red Hand Commandos whom he had met upon his initial release and who had since been jailed for attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Loyalists'', pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to politics==
Spence soon became the UVF commander within the [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze Prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;/&gt; Spence ran his part of the Maze along military lines, drilling inmates and training them in weapons use while also expecting a maintenance of discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, ''Stone Cold'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; As the loyalist Maze commander, Spence initially also had jurisdiction over the imprisoned members of the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA), although this came to an end in 1973 when, following a deterioration of relations between the two groups outside the prison walls, [[James Craig (loyalist)|James Craig]] became the UDA's Maze commander.&lt;ref&gt;Henry McDonald &amp; Jim Cusack, ''UDA'', Dublin: Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Spence polarised opinion within the UVF, with some members fiercely loyal to a man they saw as a folk hero and others resenting his draconian leadership and increasing emphasis on politics, with one anonymous member even labelling him &quot;a cunt in a cravat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, ''The Red Hand'', p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence began to move towards a position of using political means and persuaded the UVF leadership to declare a temporary ceasefire in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor138&quot;&gt;Taylor, ''Loyalists'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Merlyn Rees]]' decision to legalise the UVF in 1974, Spence encouraged them to enter politics and supported the establishment of the [[Volunteer Political Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor138&quot;/&gt; However, Spence's ideas were abandoned as the UVF ceasefire fell apart that same year following the [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]] and the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]]; the carnage of the latter had shocked and horrified Spence.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Loyalists'', p.139&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the VPP suffered a heavy defeat in West Belfast in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]], when the DUP candidate John McQuade captured six times as many votes as the VPP's [[Ken Gibson (loyalist)|Ken Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence was increasingly disillusioned with the UVF and he imparted these views to fellow inmates at Long Kesh. According to [[Billy Mitchell (UVF member)|Billy Mitchell]], Spence quizzed him and others sent to the Maze about why they were there, seeking an [[ideology|ideological]] answer to his question. When the prisoner was unable to provide one Spence would then seek to convince them of the wisdom of his more politicised path, something that he accomplished with Mitchell.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, ''Northern Protestants'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ervine]] and [[Billy Hutchinson]] were among the other UVF men imprisoned in the mid-1970s to become disciples of Spence.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''Loyalists'', pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 he publicly condemned the use of violence for political gain, on the grounds that it was counter-productive.&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;/&gt; In 1978 Spence left the UVF altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;/&gt; His brother Bobby, also a UVF member, died in October 1980 inside the Maze, a few months after the death of their brother Billy.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Roy. ''Gusty Spence''. p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==PUP activity==
Released from prison in 1984, he soon became a leading member of the UVF-linked [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (PUP) and a central figure in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;/&gt; Spence initially worked solely for the PUP but after a spell he also set up the Shankill Activity Centre, a government-supported scheme to provide training and leisure opportunities for unemployed youths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce147&quot;&gt;Bruce, ''The Red Hand'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

He was entrusted by the [[Combined Loyalist Military Command]] (CLMC) to read out their 13 October 1994 statement that announced the loyalist ceasefire. Flanked by his PUP colleagues Jim McDonald and William &quot;Plum&quot; Smith, as well as [[Ulster Democratic Party]] members [[Gary McMichael]], [[John White (loyalist)|John White]] and [[Davy Adams]], Spence read out the statement from Fernhill a former Cunningham family home on their former Glencairn estate in Belfast's Glencairn area, an important training centre for members of [[Edward Carson]]'s original [[Ulster Volunteers|UVF]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Cusack, ''UDA'', pp. 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the announcement, Spence made a trip to the [[United States]] along with the PUP's [[David Ervine]] and [[Billy Hutchinson]] and the UDP's McMichael, Adams and [[Joe English (loyalist)|Joe English]], where among their engagements was one as guests of honour of the [[National Committee on American Foreign Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Cusack, ''UDA'', p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to become a leading advocate of the [[Belfast Agreement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cainbio&quot;/&gt;

In August 2000, Spence was caught up in moves by [[Johnny Adair]]'s &quot;C&quot; Company of the UDA to take control of the Shankill by forcing out the UVF and other opponents. Adair's men forced their way into Spence's Shankill home but found it empty as Spence tended to spend much of the summer at a caravan he owned in [[Groomsport]]. Nonetheless the C Company members ransacked the house and stole Spence's army medals while the Spence family were forced to stay off the Shankill for the entirety of the [[loyalist feud]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Cusack, ''UDA'', pp. 326–327&lt;/ref&gt; When Spence's wife died three years later he said that C Company had been responsible for her death such was the toll that the events had taken on her health.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Cusack, ''UDA'', p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2007, he read out the statement by the UVF announcing that it will keep its weapons but put them beyond the reach of ordinary members. The statement also included a warning that activities could &quot;provoke another generation of loyalists toward armed resistance&quot;. He did not specify what activities or what was being resisted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6618371.stm 'UVF calls end to terror campaign ']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Spence married Louie Donaldson, a native of the city's Grosvenor Road, on 20 June 1953 at Wellwood Street Mission, [[Sandy Row]].&lt;ref&gt;Garland, R. ''Gusty Spence'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had three daughters, Elizabeth (born 1954), Sandra (1956) and Catherine (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Garland, ''Gusty Spence'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Louie died in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tel obit&quot;/&gt; Spence, a talented [[association football|footballer]] in his youth with Old Lodge F.C., was a lifelong supporter of [[Linfield F.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;Garland, ''Gusty Spence'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Spence died on 25 September 2011, aged 78, in a Belfast hospital;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tel obit&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8788015/Gusty-Spence.html Telegraph obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; he had been suffering from a long-term illness and was admitted to hospital 12 days prior to his death. Spence was praised by, among others, PUP leader [[Brian Ervine]], who stated that &quot;his contribution to the peace is incalculable&quot;; and [[Sinn Féin]]'s [[Gerry Kelly]] who claimed that while Spence had been central to the development of loyalist paramilitarism, &quot;he will also be remembered as a major influence in drawing loyalism away from sectarian strife&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15051920 Gusty Spence, former UVF leader, dies in hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a granddaughter of Matilda Gould, who died of burn injuries at the age of 74, which had been sustained in the UVF's attempted bombing of a Catholic bar next door to Gould's home, objected to Spence being called a &quot;peacemaker&quot; and described him as a &quot;bad evil man&quot;. The unnamed woman stated, &quot;When you go out and throw a petrol bomb through a widow's window, you're no peacemaker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15057808 &quot;Granddaughter of victim says Gusty Spence was not a peacemaker&quot;], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral service was held in St Michael's Church of Ireland on the Shankill Road. Notable mourners included Unionist politicians [[Dawn Purvis]], [[Mike Nesbitt]], [[Michael McGimpsey]], [[Hugh Smyth]] and Brian Ervine, UVF chief [[John &quot;Bunter&quot; Graham]] and UDA South Belfast brigadier [[Jackie McDonald]]. In accordance with Spence's wishes there were no paramilitary trappings at the funeral or reference to his time in the UVF. Instead his coffin was adorned with the beret and regimental flag of the Royal Ulster Rifles, his former British Army regiment. He was buried in [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/shankill-shuts-to-pay-its-last-respects-to-uvf-chief-gusty-spence-16056481.html &quot;Shankill shuts to pay its respects to UVF chief Gusty Spence&quot;], ''Belfast Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/ex_uvf_chief_laid_to_rest_1_3099599 &quot;Ex UVF chief laid to rest&quot;], ''Newsletter''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gutterballs''''' is a 2008 [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Ryan Nicholson]].

== Plot ==
{{Plot|date=September 2015}}
On January 1, 2008 at the Xcalibur Bowling Centre, a disco-themed bowling alley in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[British Columbia]], Egerton, the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The &quot;prep&quot;, Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the &quot;jock&quot;, had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the &quot;[[Transvestite|tranny]]&quot;, Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night.

Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to &quot;scare&quot; Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious.

The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament. Steve is joined by his &quot;girlfriends&quot;, Julia and Hannah. Jamie arrives late with Lisa, who barely speaks. As the teams begin their first game of the night, Lisa suddenly gets on an elevator. She is confronted by Patrick, who says he's only at the bowling alley to apologize. Lisa doesn't believe him, and insists that he is only there to make sure that she hasn't contacted the police. During the game, the players notice a mystery player on the scoreboard, BBK, but believe it is just a glitch. Dave, one of Jamie's friends, meets Julia in the bar and pays for two beers she ordered. When he discovers that one of them belongs to Steve, he asks if he can urinate in it. Julia tells him that she doesn't care and that she dislikes Steve too but hangs out with him anyway because he's dating her friend Hannah. Julia follows Dave into the bathroom and the two begin to make out. A mysterious person wearing bowling attire exits one of the stalls while Dave and Julia are in the [[69 (sex position)|69]] position and forces Julia's head further onto Dave's penis while forcing Dave's head further between Julia's legs, suffocating them both. After they are dead, two strikes appear next to BBK on the scoreboard in the form of a [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]].

The game continues and Sam goes to the bathroom so she can &quot;freshen up&quot;. The person who murdered Dave and Julia is hiding in one of the stalls when Sam enters the girls' restroom and Sam, frightened by the noise coming from the stall, approaches it and is pulled inside. She tries to bargain with the killer, but the killer murders her by forcing a bowling pin down her throat. The killer lifts Sam's skirt up and, using the switchblade Sam tried to defend herself with, castrates Sam lengthwise. Later, Ben and Cindy leave to have sex in a storage room upstairs, but Ben leaves Cindy alone to buy a condom from the vending machine in the bathroom. He dies when the killer hits him over the head with a bowling pin and gouges his eyes out with a sharpened one. The killer finds Cindy upstairs and strangles her to death with a pair of bowling sneakers. Downstairs, Hannah searches for Julia but dies when the killer crushes her head with two bowling balls. Joey goes back behind the pin setters to fix his team's after noticing they were broken. A.J. notices the strikes appearing next to BBK on the scoreboard and questions Egerton about it, who assures him that it is still a glitch. Egerton sends A.J. to an area currently being remodeled with an &quot;out of order&quot; sign to put on an automatic ball polisher that Joey broke earlier. A.J. turns the ball polisher on and finds it already fixed but gets killed when the killer uses it to wax his face off.

Steve, noticing that something is amiss, leaves to find Joey behind the pin setters. Joey lies dead on the ground, headless. Steve is frightened by the killer, who bludgeons him with a bowling pin before sodomizing him with another sharpened pin. As Steve tries to crawl away, the killer smashes his head in with the bowling pin. Meanwhile, Sarah and Jamie continue their game. Jamie reaches into the ball return slot to find his bowling ball, instead discovering Joey's severed head. The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming face to face with the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends' bodies. The killer appears with a shotgun and removes the bowling bag to reveal Egerton's face. Sarah discovers that Jamie knew about the murders of Steve, Joey, and A.J. but not the others. Lisa appears, dressed up as well, revealing that she murdered Steve. Jamie explains that Lisa told her father, who turns out to be Egerton, about the rape and Egerton let Jamie in on the plan. When asked why he killed their friends too, Egerton explains that they didn't intervene when Lisa reentered the bowling alley and are therefore just as guilty. Another person dressed like the killer, as Egerton goes on to explain, Another killer (possibly the real &quot;BBK&quot;) enters the basement and removes the bowling bag to reveal Patrick's face. Patrick explains that he confessed his involvement to Egerton and wanted to contact the police, but Egerton let him in on the plan instead and he was the person who murdered Joey and A.J., supposedly to make it up to her. Lisa is furious that her father allowed him to live so Egerton betrays Patrick and slits his throat with the switchblade he got from Sam. Jamie, realizing he's out of control, wrestles Egerton to the ground and, after a scuffle, blows his head clean off with the shotgun. Lisa cradles her father's body before grabbing the switchblade and trying to attack Jamie. Sarah grabs the shotgun and kills Lisa.

With the three &quot;BBK&quot;'s dead, Sarah shoots the locks off of the emergency doors and the two survivors escape the bowling alley. Traumatized and, above all, upset that Jamie did nothing to prevent the murders, Sarah turns the gun on him, pumps it saying: ''&quot;'cuz we're both fucked&quot;''. The screen cuts to black as a gunshot is heard, indicating that Sarah murdered Jamie and is on the run.

== Release ==

The Balls-Out Uncut Edition was released by Plotdigger Films on [[DVD]] on April 29, 2008. The film was re-released (with an altered soundtrack) by [[TLA Releasing]] the following year on January 27, 2009.

The Pin-Etration Edition, a cut containing hardcore inserts and limited to 69 copies, was available for purchase on the Plotdigger Films website in 2011. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.thelairoffilth.com/2012/01/filthy-review-gutterballs-pin-etration.html|title = Filthy Review - ''Gutterballs'' Pin-etration Edition|last = Felton|first = Jude|publisher = The Lair of Horror|date = 8 January 2012|website = thelairoffilth.com|accessdate = 14 December 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The film has a total of 625 [[List of films that most frequently use the word &quot;fuck&quot;|uses of the word]] &quot;[[fuck]]&quot;, ranking it third (behind the [[Fuck (film)|documentary of the same name]], about the history and usage of the word and [[Swearnet: The Movie]]) and first in total usage for a scripted motion picture. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.plotdigger.com/movies/gutterballs-2008/|title = ''Gutterballs'' (2008)|last = Nicholson|first = Ryan|publisher = Plotdigger Films|date = |website = plotdigger.com|accessdate = 24 August 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/07/wolf_of_wall_street_sets_f_word_record_we_counted_every_last_f_bomb_in_the.html|title = Is ''Wolf of Wall Street'' Really the Sweariest Movie of All Time?

Nicholson submitted the film to the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] Rating Board. The film, however, was released unrated when he was told that almost twenty minutes would have to be cut to avoid an [[NC-17]] rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gutterballs' Parents Guide|publisher=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1087853/parentalguide|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

Johnny Butane of [[Dread Central]] said that while the music was fitting and the gore was impressive, the film suffered from atrociously bad acting, and &quot;hits all the wrong notes, even if it's intentions are in the right place&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/gutterballs-2008#axzz2q0U76ITH|title = ''Gutterballs'' (2008)|last = Butane|first = Johnny|publisher = Dread Central|date = 23 March 2008|website = dreadcentral.com|accessdate = 10 January 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In a review for [[DVD Verdict]], Gordon Sullivan praised the gore, the atmosphere, and the performance of Dan Ellis, and despite finding various faults with the film (such as the prolonged rape scene, actions of the killers, and discomforting nudity) still recommended it, finding that it &quot;delivers on everything it promises: old-school [[Slasher film|slasher]] thrills loaded with gore and nudity set in a [[kitsch]]y '80s bowling alley&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/gutterballs.php|title = ''Gutterballs'' |last = Sullivan|first = Gordon|publisher = DVD Verdict|date = 30 January 2009|website = dvdverdict.com|accessdate = 10 January 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; ''Gutterballs'' was described as &quot;one of the weirdest movies I've seen&quot; by Kurt Dahlke of DVD Talk, who gave it a two and a half out of a possible five, and concluded that it was &quot;a damn fine sexually explicit, graphically violent, morally repugnant, willfully bad [[B movie]]&quot; that refreshingly took itself seriously, despite the over-the-top subject matter. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/36094/gutterballs/|title = ''Gutterballs'' |last = Dahlke|first = Kurt|publisher = DVD Talk|date = 27 January 2009|website = dvdtalk.com|accessdate = 10 January 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequel ==
A [[sequel]], subtitled ''Balls Deep'', premiered in 2015, written and directed by Ryan Nicholson. The film stars Aidan Dee, Momona Komagata and Kirsty Elizabeth in the leading roles.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/90127/exclusive-first-stills-gutterballs-2-balls-deep/|title = ''Gutterballs 2: Balls Deep|last = Nicholson|first = Ryan|publisher = Plotdigger Films|date = |website = plotdigger.com|accessdate = 17 February 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered in May 2015 as part of the [[Texas Frightmare Weekend]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.fangoria.com/new/texas-frightmare-weekend-2015-adds-screening-slate-american-horror-story-actress/|title = Texas Frightmare Weekend 2015 Adds Screening Slate|last =La Vigna|first = Christopher|publisher = Fangoria|date = |website = Fangoria.com|accessdate = 17 February 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Guwange'''''|ぐわんげ|Guwange}} is a [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|vertical scrolling shooter]] developed by [[Cave (company)|Cave]] and published by [[Atlus]] in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].

==Gameplay==
''Guwange''{{'}}s gameplay contains elements that are unique or uncommon in the vertically scrolling shooting game genre.  The screen will often scroll horizontally or even diagonally, depending on the course the protagonist must take to reach the demon leader. Each character has a limited bomb attack in the form of an energy blast that can be sent in any direction, and will dispel any bullets it touches. Another special attack involves sending the shikigami into the midst of the enemies, with two particular advantages. First, the shikigami does not have to attack in the same direction as the player is firing, and can even get past obstacles that would otherwise thwart normal shots. If an enemy projectile touches the shikigami, it will change to a pink color and will drastically slow down.  If the shot passes the shikigami, it will return to its original color and resume at full speed; however, if the bullet is caught in an explosion, it will be cancelled and turned into coins.

Score is almost entirely dependent on the continuous, uninterrupted collection of coins.  The player must constantly damage or destroy enemies in order to replenish a countdown timer; when the timer (represented by a meter in the upper-left corner of the screen) depletes entirely, the player's coin count returns to zero.  Guwange is unique in that the player may maintain a &quot;chain&quot; of coin collection throughout the entire game, instead of a more conventional stage-by-stage approach.  This makes Guwange's scoring system extremely unforgiving.

;Bosses

*Fujimura Shizuhiko (Stage 1 boss) (age 24). Bearer of the wood talisman. Although Fujimura appears to be an ordinary female dancer, this is not the case. &quot;She&quot; is actually a man named Fujihara Motohiko, who has accepted demonic power to get revenge on the clan that destroyed his family. The attendant dancers are actually demons assigned to assist Fujihara in his revenge, and to kill him if he shows signs of wanting to relinquish his power and reclaim his humanity.
*Madaramukade (Stage 2 boss). Bearer of the fire talisman.
*Nekogumo (Stage 3 boss). A horrific monster, part cat and part spider, and bearer of the earth talisman. She uses an abandoned temple for her lair, devouring any traveler hapless enough to come near.
*Kemonoyajiro (Stage 4 boss). A mysterious shrine that has been possessed by a man-eating demon, and is powered by the metal talisman.
*Ashikaga Sukouji (Stage 5 boss, phase 1). A descendant of one of the architects of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]]. However, because of his illegitimacy, his birth father condemned him as a &quot;monkey's child&quot;, and banished him to live with a priest as an ascetic. When the priest died, he revealed the truth of Sukouji's parentage. Enraged, Sukouji assaulted his father's castle, empowered by Magira, the monkey demon whom Sukouji's father had unwittingly invited with his curse. Once Sukouji took the castle for his own, it became increasingly known for demonic associations, only intensifying when Fujihara entrusted the water talisman to Sukouji.
*Magira (Stage 5 boss, phase 2)
*Guwange-sama (Stage 6 boss, phases 1-2)
*Amagizu (age 400+) and Mikoto (age 5) (Stage 6 bosses, phase 3) Amagizu was a nun who was persecuted by the [[bakufu]] four centuries ago, and attempted to take refuge to give birth on the mountain that would be called Gokumon. As she bore her child, though, Guwange took the opportunity to possess it, transfiguring it into a demonic form and absorbing Amagizu's lower body. Since then, they have remained in this combined state, with Amagizu voicing Guwange's will to his subordinates. Mikoto, the daughter of Shishin, showed great spiritual power from her birth. Two years ago, though, she was discovered by Amagizu, and taken prisoner by her agents. Amagizu has been using Mikoto's power to amplify her and Guwange's own power, increasing their influence over the spirit realm and an ever-greater portion of Japan. Meanwhile, rumors of Mikoto's power have spread throughout the Ashikaga shougunate, and various lords have attempted to capture her from Gokumon in order to take that power for her own. Not a single person sent to capture her has come back from Gokumon alive.

==Plot==
The story of ''Guwange'' is set during the [[Muromachi period]] of Japan. During this time, increasing numbers of people suffer possession by [[shikigami]]. Although the shikigami grant great spiritual powers, the strain inflicted on the host causes them to die exactly one year after possession. However, a legend has sprung up regarding Guwange, the malevolent god trapped in Mt. Gokumon (i.e. Hell Gate). If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements—wood, fire, earth, metal, water—from five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death.

;Characters
*'''Shishin''' (age 35), with shikigami Rikiou (age 500+). Attacks with [[kunai]]. Unlike most hosts of shikigami, Shishin has been able to live for more than a year after possession. This is because Rikiou has made an effort to keep Shishin alive, so long as he kills other humans for Rikiou to devour. The fact that Shishin never speaks, and always wears the mask of an [[oni (folklore)|oni]], has led to commoners speaking of him as actually being the human-eating ogre in question. However, one day, Shishin experiences a vision of a goddess explaining to him how destroying Guwange will not only free him of Rikiou, but also restore the one he loves to him—his lost daughter Mikoto.
*'''Kamono Gensuke''' (age 15), with shikigami Kirinmaru (age 300+). Gensuke is in training as a pharmacist, and the son of an [[onmyouji]]. Kirinmaru is a bloodthirsty [[tengu]] who holds a grudge against the elder Kamono. To fulfill that grudge, Kirinmaru has possessed Gensuke. In order to channel the tengu's malice away from innocents, Gensuke has become a bounty hunter, all the while looking for a way to free himself from the curse.
*'''Hiiragi Kosame''' (age 17), with shikigami Yatsuhisha (age 200+). Attacks with bow and arrows. Kosame is a [[miko]] and member of a family of demon hunters. During a conflict with demons, Kosame became possessed by Yatsuhisha, a [[kitsune]], and has been commanded by her father to exorcise herself of him by destroying Guwange. Unusually, Yatsuhisha is perfectly willing to help Kosame in this quest. Yatsuhisha was raised by a demon with little use for malice towards humans, and has come to regard Kosame as a close friend. Even though it would mean his own death, Yatsuhisha intends to put all his effort into saving Kosame from her own death.

Each player gets a unique introduction, and ending after completing the game.

{{Nihongo|'''Guy'''|ガイ|Gai}} is a video game [[Character (arts)|character]] who first appeared in the 1989 [[arcade game|arcade]] [[beat-em-up]] ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' by [[Capcom]]. Guy, along with other ''[[Final Fight (series)|Final Fight]]'' series characters, has also been a recurring [[player character]] in the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' [[fighting game]] series since ''[[Street Fighter Alpha|Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams]]'' in 1995. Guy is a crimson-clad [[ninja|ninpō]] master of [[Japanese American|Japanese descent]] who has been taught the {{Nihongo|Bushin|武神|Warrior God}} form of [[ninjutsu]]. The kanji, 武神, written on Guy's top literally translates to &quot;God of War&quot;.

In the original ''Final Fight'' he aides his friend [[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]] as well as Metro City Mayor [[Mike Haggar]] in rescuing Jessica, who is Haggar's daughter and Cody's girlfriend. Guy was excluded from the [[SNES]] version of the game, but a special version replacing Cody with Guy was also released. While he is not a playable character in the sequel ''[[Final Fight 2]]'', Guy factors into the storyline as his girlfriend and her father are captured. Guy returned to the ''Final Fight'' series as selectable character in ''[[Final Fight 3]]''. He also appears in ''[[Final Fight: Streetwise]]'', but is not playable in the game's story mode. His sister-in-law is [[Maki Genryusai]], who was introduced as one of the protagonists of ''Final Fight 2''.

The character has been well received, often being named to various lists of top ''Street Fighter'' characters. His popularity with fans has resulted in Capcom adding him to many of its newer fighting games.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
====In ''Final Fight''====
Guy is one of three playable characters, along with [[Cody Travers|Cody]] and [[Mike Haggar]], in the original arcade version of ''Final Fight'', released for the [[arcade game|arcades]] by Capcom in 1989. Guy's original face and character design were inspired by those of [[Guy Picciotto]], the vocalist of the late eighties post-hardcore punk rock band [[Fugazi]].{{cn|date=May 2014}} In the backstory of the original ''Final Fight'', Guy is established to be the 39th successor of the Bushin-style Ninpo, and as such, in his appearances he wears the kanji {{Nihongo|Bushin|武神|}} embroidered into his [[shinobi shozoku]]. His speech and mannerisms are characterised by a stiff formality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetfighter.com/us/ssfiv/characters |title=Characters - Super Street Fighter® Iv |publisher=Streetfighter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the three fighters have their own unique characteristics, with Guy being the fastest of the three due to his ninjutsu skills. One of his most novel techniques in the game is the &quot;Off-the-Wall Kick&quot; which allows Guy to bounce off the wall with a jump kick. Due to space constraint, Guy was initially omitted from the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] port of the game, with Cody and Haggar being the only playable characters in that version. Capcom later produced a second SNES version titled ''[[Final Fight Guy]]'', which replaced Cody's character with that of Guy (who is the only character featured in the game's cover art). Later versions of the game such as ''Final Fight CD'' for [[Sega CD]] and ''Final Fight One'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] would include all three characters. Capcom also produced an [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game titled ''[[Mighty Final Fight]]'', a parody of the original ''Final Fight'' which features all three characters. 

Capcom later released ''[[Final Fight 2]]'' in 1993, a sequel created specifically for the SNES. In this installment, Guy's [[sensei]], Genryusai and his daughter Rena (Guy's fiancee), are kidnapped by the new incarnation of Mad Gear. In the game's story, Guy is off on a training mission and is unable to rescue his fiancee and master. Instead, the game features Guy's sister-in-law, [[Maki (Final Fight)|Maki Genryusai]], who has also been trained in the same fighting style, and Carlos Miyamoto, a South American swordsman. Guy only makes an appearance in the end of the game, although the game does feature power-up icons shaped after his character. In ''[[Final Fight 3]]'', released in 1995, Guy finally returns to [[Final Fight|Metro City]] and teams up with Haggar to rid Metro City of the Skull Cross gang, the latest gang to try to pick up where Mad Gear had left off. They are joined by Metro City SCU officer Lucia Morgan and former gang member who double crossed the gang, Dean (who wanted revenge when Skull Cross murdered his family). The four succeed, and are able to rid Metro City of the criminals. Metro City is left in shambles, but Guy does not seem to care, and leaves that to Haggar.

In 1998, Guy was featured in ''[[Final Fight Revenge]]'', the American-produced fighting game for the arcades and [[Sega Saturn]]. In 2006, the second American-produced ''Final Fight'' sequel, ''[[Final Fight: Streetwise]]'', reimagined Guy's character as a Japanese crime lord in the Japan Town district of Metro City.

====In ''Street Fighter''====
When Capcom produced the original ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'' in 1995, Guy would be one of two ''Final Fight'' characters to be included in the game along with the game's second stage boss [[Sodom (Street Fighter character)|Sodom]]. According to Tatsuya Minami, senior manager of Capcom's Product Planning and Design section, Capcom included Guy in the game because he was extremely popular and easy to translate to the one-on-one fighting genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=The Maximum Street Fighter Alpha R&amp;D Interview|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=4 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=March 1996|pages=68-69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this game, Guy's character design was altered slightly, with his [[jika-tabi]] replaced by sneakers, although his fighting style mimics that of his ''Final Fight'' counterpart. Guy and Sodom would be joined by [[Rolento]] in 1996's ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]'' and by Cody in 1998's ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', followed by Maki's appearance in the portable versions of ''Alpha 3''. Guy's new design would be used in the second ''Final Fight'' sequel for the SNES, ''Final Fight 3'' and along with Cody's ''Street Fighter Alpha'' rendition, are also hidden characters in ''Final Fight One'' (''Final Fight'' for the [[Game Boy]]). In the ''Alpha'' games, Guy's Bushin predecessor is revealed to be a man named Zeku, who would appear in Guy's ending in ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'' to test Guy for his successor-ship. Zeku's presence in the game contradicts ''Final Fight 2'', which identifies Genryusai as Guy's sensei, as designers of the ''Alpha'' games did not take into account the SNES ''Final Fight'' sequels when developing the games. Zeku was mentioned once again in Guy's bio in ''Street Fighter Alpha 3''.

In ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', Guy was one of the new characters added in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1up.com/news/final-fight-characters-join-super Final Fight Characters Join Super Street Fighter IV], [[1UP.com]], 11/25/2009&lt;/ref&gt; In his ending, he is shown rescuing an unconscious [[Rose (Street Fighter character)|Rose]] from Bison. In Rose's ending it is hinted that he might be the only one powerful enough to stop Bison (though in ''[[Street Fighter V]]'', Bison is destroyed once and for all by Ryu), and in Cody's ending Guy is shown trying to persuade him to come back on the right side of the law. Guy is also the one who threw the [[kunai]] in [[Fei Long]]'s ending in the original ''Street Fighter IV'', since [[Ibuki (Street Fighter)|Ibuki]] has no involvement with S.I.N.

====In crossover games====
Guy is as a playable character in ''[[Capcom Fighting Jam]]'', a crossover fighting game featuring characters from ''[[Darkstalkers]]'', ''[[Red Earth (video game)|Red Earth]]'' and ''Street Fighter''. Guy is a playable character in the Japan-only tactical role-playing game ''[[Namco × Capcom]]'', in which he is paired with Sho (Ginzu) from ''[[Captain Commando]]'' as a single unit, the in-game story depicting Sho as his future Bushin-ryu successor. He also appears as a playable character via DLC (actually contained on the game disc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://shoryuken.com/2012/03/05/street-fighter-x-tekken-elena-gameplay/ |title=UPDATE: Street Fighter x Tekken DLC on Disc – Elena, Guy, Cody, Blanka, Bryan, Lei, Lars, Mega Man, Pac-Man, Alisa, Sakura, Christie, Dudley Gameplay « Shoryuken |publisher=Shoryuken.com |date=2012-03-05 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the ''[[Tekken]]'' and ''Street Fighter'' series' crossover fighting game ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'', along with his official tag partner Cody, and where ''Tekken'''s [[Raven (Tekken)|Raven]] can be dressed in  Guy's costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/sfxtk_en/system.html |title=Capcom：Street Fighter X Tekken｜System |website=Capcom.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gameplay====
Guy's fighting style can be described as a fusion of traditional ninjutsu with modern street brawling, and is also the only ''Final Fight'' character in the ''Street Fighter Alpha'' series not to use a weapon (though he can throw a close-ranged burst of ki and shuriken in ''Final Fight 3'' and ''Final Fight Revenge'' respectively). In ''Final Fight 3'' and Namco X Capcom, Guy had in his repertoire a &quot;fireball&quot; style attack, although it dissipates a short distance from his palm. According to ''Street Fighter IV'' developer Taisaku Okada,&lt;ref name=&quot;eventhubs.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2009/dec/01/developers-discuss-guy-super-street-fighter-4/ |title=Developers discuss Guy in Super Street Fighter 4 : News : EventsHub.com |publisher=Eventhubs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy is a character that does not use &quot;ki&quot; and thus has no use for fireballs or projectiles. In ''Namco × Capcom'' Guy participates in the Multiple Assault attacks that involve all of the Commando Team.

In ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'', Guy was one of the few characters who could perform chain combos after they were removed. According to ''[[Expert Gamer]]'', the player using Guy in ''Alpha 3'' should play defensively, as Guy takes a lot of damage when he is hit, and to rely on Guy's speed and varied attacks.&lt;ref&gt;''Expert Gamer'' 59 (May 1999), page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a guide to ''[[Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition]]'', [[GameSpy]] stated that &quot;Guy is a frantic fighter. As he is without a fireball and effective zoning tools, he requires very aggressive, close-up fighting where he can land quick combos to chew into the opponent's health. This constantly forward-moving action makes Guy vulernable to counter hits, but he's got enough variety in his tool set to make it work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-3ds/street-fight-3ds/guide/page_32.html Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition Walkthrough &amp; Strategy Guide], GameSpy, January 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[MTV]] Multiplayer, similar to [[Ibuki (Street Fighter)|Ibuki]], &quot;Guy requires an expert. His punches and kicks, while dazzling and lengthy, require precision. They also require an eye for patterns and combination opportunities, so stay frosty. Without those things in mind, you'll find Guy to be nothing more than a poor but fast damage dealer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2010/04/27/super-street-fighter-4-character-guide-guy/ |title=‘Super Street Fighter 4′ Character Guide – Guy |publisher=Multiplayerblog.mtv.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other media===
Guy appears in the American ''[[Street Fighter (TV series)|Street Fighter]]'' animated series in an episode titled &quot;Final Fight&quot;, which adapts the plot of its namesake. In this episode, Guy and Cody befriend Ryu and [[Ken (Street Fighter)|Ken]], who aid them in fighting the Mad Gear Gang to save Jessica. He also makes an appearance in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]'' as one of the warriors who have agreed to accompany Ryu, Ken and [[Chun-Li]] to Professor Sadler's base and rescue Shun, Ryu's alleged brother. As the fighters battle each other outside Sadler's base to demonstrate their skills, Guy fights Dhalsim. When Sadler's true intentions are revealed, Guy and the other fighters are freed by Ken and Chun-Li.

Guy makes an appearance in [[UDON]]'s ''Street Fighter II Turbo'' comic, in which he was given an invitation to fight in the Japanese branch of the Street Fighter Tournament by [[M. Bison]]. Dan tries to take Guy's invitation from him by force, yet is quickly defeated. At night, Dan breaks into Guy's house and steals his invitation; Guy witnesses the whole event, but decides to give Dan a chance, as he was not planning on joining the competition in the first place. Guy also appears in the manga adaptation of ''Street Fighter Alpha'' by Masahiko Nakahira, where he is depicted as a well-known [[vigilante]] ninja credited with bringing an end to several criminal organisations. Guy disguised himself as a member of Shadaloo to face M. Bison, but he is forced to reveal his identity when [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]] tries to kill both Adon and a possessed [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]]. After making quick work of Vega, Guy kicks several oil drums at Ryu (a nod to the ''Final Fight'' series), then proceeds to fight Ryu. Due to Guy's superior speed and training to fight multiple enemies at once, Guy is able to block every attack from Ryu's [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Shun Goku Satsu]] and defeat him. He is last seen watching over the battle between Ryu and Sagat.

==Reception==
Since his debut in 1989, Guy became a popular character in the fighting game fandom. In the Japanese coin-operated video game magazine ''Gamest'', Guy was ranked second in the top characters of the year poll for 1990 (with Cody at seventh, [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]] at 26th, Sodom at 33rd, and Jessica at 40th)&lt;ref name=gamest54&gt;{{cite journal|journal=GAMEST|script-title=ja:ゲーメスト大賞|issue=54|language=Japanese|pages=10–16|first=Zenji|last=Ishii|url=http://www.netlaputa.ne.jp/~dummy/gamest/magazine/gamest/v054.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked at 26th place in the same poll for 1996.&lt;ref name=gamest10th&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ishii |first=Zenji |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 1996 |title=第10回ゲーメスト大賞 |journal=Gamest Magazine |volume=188 |issue= |page=pg. 46 |id= |url=http://www.netlaputa.ne.jp/~dummy/gamest/magazine/gamest/v188.html |accessdate=2008-12-28 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, an editor of [[GameSpot]] named Guy as his personal favourite and called him &quot;the best character in the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/2700185/qotw-who-is-your-favorite-game-character/index.html?page=3 |title=QOTW: Who is your favorite game character? |publisher=GameSpot.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Guy was voted the 16th most popular out of 85 ''Street Fighter'' characters in Capcom's own poll for the 15th anniversary of ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=//www2.geestore.com/sf15th2/sf15rank/ninkichara.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-12-19 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219091936/www2.geestore.com/sf15th2/sf15rank/ninkichara.html |archivedate=December 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] ranked Guy 24th in their top ''Street Fighter'' characters list in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://stars.ign.com/articles/894/894966p2.html Top 25 Street Fighter Characters - Day I].

Guy also became often one of the characters most requested to be added to the Capcom games' characters rosters. On the official Capcom forums, he was most requested ''Final Fight'' character to be added to the roster of ''Street Fighter IV'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/street_fighter/go/thread/view/7411/677481/Discussion:_Should_FinalFight_characters_Return |title=Street Fighter &gt; Thread &gt; Discussion: Should FinalFight characters Return? |publisher=Capcom-unity.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the second most requested character overall to be added to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/street_fighter/go/thread/view/7411/20201313/Character_RequestAnticipation_Thread |title=Street Fighter &gt; Thread &gt; Character Request/Anticipation Thread |publisher=Capcom-unity.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[GamesRadar]] too included him in the list of 12 fighters they would like to see in ''Super Street Fighter IV''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/12-fighters-wed-like-to-see-in-super-street-fighter-iv/a-2009100210244058060 |title=12 fighters we'd like to see in Super Street Fighter IV |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the game's developers Takashi Tsukamoto and Taisaku Okada, they have &quot;compiled a list of characters that players wanted to see in the game [and] Guy was one of the names on the first list&quot; in both Japan and  America (&quot;he's pretty popular overseas as well&quot;) and the development team &quot;also wanted to get Guy in the game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eventhubs.com&quot;/&gt; He also ranked 10th on the list of top 55 most requested ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'' [[Downloadable content|DLC]] characters in a poll by [[Nico Nico Douga]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shoryuken.com/content/japan-s-top-55-most-requests-marvel-vs-capcom-3-dlc-characters-2594/ Shoryuken - Japan's Top 55 Most Requests Marvel vs Capcom 3 DLC Characters].

'''Guy Georges''' (born '''Guy Rampillon''', 15 October 1962) is a French [[serial killer]], dubbed &quot;The Beast of the Bastille&quot;, who was convicted of murdering seven women between 1991 and 1997.

== Biography ==
He was born Guy Rampillon to a French mother and a [[Black American]] father (George Cartwright, a soldier [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/nov/25/weekend.paulwebster]) who abandoned him as a small child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/beast-of-bastille-guy-georges/biography.html;jsessionid=D020D00E6FA9AB8931B581D566DFFDC8?

'''Guy Martel''' is a French [[spree killer]] who killed seven people and wounded at least five others in several towns and villages in the departments [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] and [[Cotes-du-Nord]] on June 19, 1985, before he was arrested.

==Life==
Martel was born in Paris in 1944 during the [[Occupied France|Nazi occupation of France]]. His father Victor was a member of the [[Garde Mobile|garde mobile]], and he had three sisters. Martel earned a degree in mathematics and chemistry, joined the military and was sent to Costa Rica, where he taught in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. He rarely spoke about his time there, but he related that he had seen horrible things and had to perform the duties of someone of higher rank, who had been killed. In 1969 he had been taken hostage by guerrilleros, or bandits for three weeks and upon his release he was flown back to France. From then on he complained about being ill, saying he had caught a virus and suffered from intestinal pain and pain in the spine.

Martel accepted a position as a natural sciences teacher at Henri Matisse college in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], but in 1972, after less than two years, he had to quit due to a nervous disorder and was put on a long term disability leave. Afterwards he had briefly been in mental institutions three times &amp;ndash; once in Paris, and twice in Brittany &amp;ndash; and was accorded a degree of disability of 80%. In 1975 he was granted a disability pension and moved in with his parents in [[Baguer-Morvan]]. When his mother died from a heart attack in 1976 his condition began to deteriorate and he saw hostility everywhere. Due to a growing discord between him and his father he decided to live alone and bought a house in [[Dol-de-Bretagne]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=Monde&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1985/06/21/de-l-ille-et-vilaine-aux-cotes-du-nord-le-tragique-itineraire-du-tueur-dement-sept-morts-et-cinq-blesses-en-trois-heures_3048801_1819218.html?xtmc=guy_martel&amp;xtcr=3  Le tragique itinéraire du tueur dément], ''[[Le Monde]]'' (June 21, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Once there Martel rarely left his home except to lie in his garden, or to play tennis at a local sports hall. He also ate lunch every day at a home for elderly people. Besides his father and an uncle, who occasionally came over to mow his lawn, as well as his doctor, Mr. Launay, he had no visitors and consequently was known as &quot;monsieur tout seul&quot; (Mr. all alone) throughout the village.

Martel generally was quickly fatigued and he complained a lot about noise, especially those made by children, whom he called loud and annoying. When one day a child pressed his doorbell and ran away he came out angrily, shouting: &quot;If you do that again, I will kill you!&quot;&lt;ref name=PM0507&gt;Sept meurtres pour briser sa solitude, ''[[Paris Match]]'' (July 5, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also reported that Martel had been under treatment for mental problems in a hospital near [[Rennes]] since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-20/news/mn-10006_1_hunting-rifle Frenchman Kills 7 With Hunting Rifle], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (June 20, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=se8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1vsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4969,1652167&amp;dq= Mental patient kills 7 in France], ''[[Lakeland Ledger]]'' (June 20, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=egxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zwIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5834,1403451 7 killed, 5 wounded by gunman in France], ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' (June 20, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
On June 19, at about 10 a.m. Martel's father came to visit him and apparently they had some sort of argument. After his father had left, Martel took his .22-caliber rifle with scope, which he had purchased about ten years prior from [[Manufrance]], as well as a box of cartridges, put them in the trunk of his car and drove to the house of his father in Baguer-Morvan.

Since his father was not yet home Martel drove back to Dol-de-Bretagne, where he arrived at approximately 11 a.m. at the home of his uncle, 64-year-old Charles Martel, who was picking cherries. Martel first had a normal conversation with him, but eventually returned to his car, retrieved his rifle and shot Charles Martel three times, wounding him, and also shot at, but missed one of his cousins.

Martel then drove to the retirement home where he entered the kitchen. When the cook, Mrs. Lozac'h, who was standing at the stove, explained that it was not yet time to eat, he replied that he would come back later (Je reviendrai tout à l'heure.) and shot at her, grazing her head. Martel left again and proceeded to doctor Launay's office. There he entered the room of Launay's colleague, Michel Lhommelet, who was examining a child, and killed him with four shots to the back. He next stopped at the gymnasium, where he used to play tennis, entered the office of Mrs. Le Maréchal, who was managing the facility, and shot her dead. 

Thereupon Martel returned to Baguer-Morvan, finding his father just arriving at his home. Martel killed him outside his house by shooting him several times. By that time reports of the loose gunman had spread in Dol-de-Bretagne, and shops were closed and children kept at school, while police began their search operation.

Meanwhile the 41-year-old made his way to Rocher-Aoustin near [[Combourg]], where he killed Joseph Weber, also an uncle of his, with a shot from his rifle. In [[La Chapelle-aux-Filtzméens]] Martel shot at the brothers Jean and Eugène Chaussonnière, killing the former and seriously wounding the latter, while in [[Saint-Domineuc]] Pierre Bourtourault was shot dead when gathering hay at the roadside. In [[Quebriac]] he killed 33-year-old Danièle Pomard, whose body was found at 13:35 by garbage collectors. 

Near [[Trévérien]] Martel shot and wounded 29-year-old André Rehault on his tractor. At that time he was eventually spotted by a police helicopter and he left [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] and drove into [[Cotes-du-Nord]], wounding on his way 34-year-old Daniel Lebreton, who was eating lunch in his truck near [[Saint-Judoce]], and 40-year-old Raymond Prechoux in [[Saint-Juvat]]. Martel afterwards fired at three other persons before finally being stopped by police in [[Saint-André-des-Eaux, Côtes-d'Armor|Saint-André-des-Eaux]] at around 14:00. He stepped out of his car, hands raised and yelling: &quot;Don't shoot! I am sick!&quot; (Ne tirez pas! Je suis malade!) and was arrested.&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1985/06/20/pagina-25/32857387/pdf.html Francia: un perturbado mata a 7 personas, entre ellas su padre], ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' (June 20, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franzose tötete sieben Menschen, ''[[Hamburger Abendblatt]]'' (June 20, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Being asked about the reason for him shooting people at random he explained that at first he had business with his family and a few others, but upon realizing that it was easy to shoot people, he simply continued. (Au début, je n'avais affaire qu'à ma famille et a quelques autres personnes... Après, j'ai réalise que c'était facile de tirer. Alors, j'ai continue.)&lt;ref name=PM0507/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5285">{{Infobox character|series=|name=Guy Montag|image=[[File:Guy_Montag.jpg|225px]]|caption=|first=''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''|last=|creator=[[Ray Bradbury]]|portrayer=[[Oskar Werner]]|lbl1=|data1=|family=Mildred (wife)}}'''Guy Montag''' is the protagonist in [[Ray Bradbury]]'s [[dystopia]]n 1953 novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''.  He is depicted living in a futuristic town where he works as a &quot;fireman&quot; whose job is to burn books.

==Role in plot==
At the opening of the novel, he is happy in his work destroying books and never wonders about his role as a tool of [[thought suppression]]. Several events cause him to question his existence: 
*First, he meets [[Clarisse McClellan]], a 17 year-old  while walking home from work. His talks with her are thought-provoking and assuage Montag's loneliness. Her death spurs him into becoming a radical.
*Second, he discovers his [[Mildred Montag|wife]], who prefers watching &quot;The Family&quot; her favorite program on television or the parlor walls, and radio or &quot;seashell earbuds&quot; to human interaction, has overdosed on sleeping pills. The callous behavior of the paramedics makes him feel very [[Social alienation|alienated]], while his wife's emptiness disturbs and angers him.
*Third, he has a call to go to a house owned by an old woman who hid away a library of books. Rather than be led out of the house before it is burned, she decides to set the fire herself, and burns alive with her books.
*Fourth, he remembers a chance meeting he had one year previously with an old man in the park, who is later identified as [[Faber (character)|an English professor]]. Montag, who has secretly been hiding books in his own house, eventually makes contact with this man, named Faber.
Over the course of the novel, Montag becomes increasingly disillusioned with the [[hedonism|hedonistic]], [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] society around him. Bradbury emphasizes that the U.S. government, in burning books, is merely expressing the will of a people whose short attention spans, indifference, and hedonism have gradually eroded any semblance of [[intellectualism]] from public life. Schools no longer teach the humanities, children are casually violent, and adults are constantly distracted by &quot;seashells&quot; (small audio devices resembling [[earbud]]s) and insipid [[television]] programs displayed on wall-sized screens. Authors and readers are regarded as pretentious and dangerous to the well-being of society. He meets many characters that change his outlook on life such as Clarisse and Faber.

After an incident where Montag tries to read a poem to his wife's friends when they are visiting, his wife denounces their house as book-possessing. Montag's fire chief, [[Captain Beatty|Beatty]], tries to persuade him that books are evil, and urges him to return to the unthinking fireman mentality, but Montag refuses. 

After the firehouse receives an alert, Beatty drives the fire truck to the location, which is Montag's house. Beatty forces Montag to set fire to his own house. After Montag is finished, Beatty confronts Montag and discovers the device he uses to communicate with Faber. After Beatty vows to track down who was on the other line, Montag turns the fire hose on Beatty and burns him to death.

He flees through the city streets to Faber's house, with another firehouse's mechanical hound and television network helicopters in hot pursuit. When he arrives at Faber's home, the old man tells Montag of vagabond book-lovers in the countryside. Montag then escapes to a local river, floats downstream and meets a group of older men who, to Montag's astonishment, have memorized entire books, preserving them orally until the law against books is overturned. The war begins. Montag watches helplessly as jet bombers fly overhead and attack the city with [[nuclear weapon]]s.

==In other media==
Montag's fate is expanded on in the semi-canonical [[Fahrenheit 451 (video game)|1984 video game ''Fahrenheit 451'']], which acts as a sequel to the novel. In the game, Montag has continued to evade and resist the Firemen for over five years after the end of the novel and is sent on a mission to break into [[New York Library]] and transmit its microcassette archive to the Underground. He succeeds and reunites with Clarisse (who is alive in this version) during the process; however the Firemen storm the building and immolate them both.

==Historical notes==
*Montag is portrayed by [[Oskar Werner]] in the 1966 [[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|film version]].
*Bradbury notes that he found, after the book was published, that Montag is the name of a paper company, making him the counterpart to [[Faber (Fahrenheit 451)|Faber]], which is also the name of [[Faber-Castell|a pencil manufacturer]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Ray.

'''Guy Paul Morin''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] who was wrongly convicted of the October 1984 [[rape]] and murder of his nine-year-old next-door neighbour, Christine Jessop of [[Queensville, Ontario|Queensville]], north of [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. [[DNA]] testing led to a subsequent overturning of this verdict. As of 2014, no one else has been charged with Jessop's murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = For Janet Jessop, October is a time to mourn murdered daughter Christine all over again|date = 15 August 2012|url = http://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2012/08/15/for_janet_jessop_october_is_a_time_to_mourn_murdered_daughter_christine_all_over_again.html|last = Rush|first = Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder of Christine Jessop ==
On 3 October 1984, Jessop was dropped off at her home from her school bus with both of her parents out.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; She was last seen by the owner of a nearby convenience store where she had gone to buy bubble gum.

== Trials ==
Morin was arrested for Jessop's murder in April 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; He was later acquitted at his first trial in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OxgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_KUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5114,2939925|title=Appeal planned|date=6 March 1986|work=Montreal Gazette|page=B–1|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Crown attorney|Crown]] exercised its right to appeal the [[verdict]] on the grounds that the trial judge made a fundamental error prejudicing the Crown's right to a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-9YyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pu8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3062,2335594|title=Crown to appeal Morin's acquittal|date=6 March 1986|work=Ottawa Citizen|page=A–12|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the [[List of Canadian courts of appeal|Court of Appeal]] ordered a new trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/championarticles/19980808?opendocument|title=The Ordeal of Guy Paul Morin: Canada Copes With Systemic Injustice|last=King|first=Jack|date=August 1988|work=Champion Magazine|publisher=National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers|accessdate=16 August 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5s2AJbWDF|archivedate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The retrial was delayed until 1992 by Morin's own appeals based on the Crown's non-disclosure of [[exculpatory evidence]] and by other issues, including the [[Double jeopardy#Canada|double jeopardy]] rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt;

Morin was convicted at his second trial and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/26005--canadian-cases-of-wrongful-conviction|title=Canadian Cases Of Wrongful Conviction|first=31 January 2007|work=CityNews|publisher=Rogers Broadcasting|accessdate=16 August 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5s2BTxojR|archivedate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike others convicted of murdering children after sexually abusing them, he was kept in the general population throughout his time in prison.&lt;ref name=Nolan&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/509274431.html?dids=509274431:509274431&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+28%2C+1997&amp;author=Dan+Nolan&amp;pub=The+Spectator&amp;desc=Morin+feared+for+his+life%3A+Jailers+rejected+isolation&amp;pqatl=google|title=Morin feared for his life: Jailers rejected isolation|last=Nolan|first=Dan|date=28 October 1997|work=The Spectator|accessdate=16 August 2010|location=Hamilton, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Up until his release, he was held at [[Kingston Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nolan&quot; /&gt;

Dr. Guy Turcotte, born April 21, 1972,&lt;ref name=Anonymous&gt;{{cite journal|title=Father charged in children's deaths; Custody battle believed behind two killings|journal=Ottawa citizen|date=Feb 25, 2009 |pages=A.4.|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/241246083?accountid=14701|accessdate=March 3, 2014 |issn=0839-3222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Montgomery 1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montgomery|first=Sue|title=Not criminally responsible verdicts three times higher here than B.C.; Facebook page protesting outcome of Guy Turcotte case draws 17,500 'fans'|journal=The Gazette |date=8 July 2011 |pages=A.9. |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/875695263?accountid=14701|accessdate=March 3, 2014 |issn=0384-1294}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked with his wife Dr. Isabelle Gaston at Hotel-Dieu de Saint-Jerome as a cardiologist.&lt;ref name=Anonymous /&gt; He met and began a relationship with Gaston in [[Québec City]] in 1999. They moved in together in 2000, but their relationship became hostile to the point of domestic violence on both parts. Due to this violence, Turcotte moved out but reconciled with Gaston shortly after promising to work on their relationship. Following their reconciliation Turcotte proposed to Gaston at Mount Washington, New Hampshire; Gaston accepted his proposal. Gilles Turcotte (Guy Turcotte’s brother) said he &quot;was attentive to his children and nieces and nephews… When Guy is playing with the children, we can see he is having as much fun as them…&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katherine Wilton&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilton|first=Katherine|title=Tearful Turcotte tells court of love for wife; Adored his children, murder trial hears |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/866986947|accessdate=March 1, 2014 |newspaper=The Gazette|date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-January 2009, shortly before Gaston and Turcotte were planning to leave for a trip to Mexico with their children, Turcotte learned that his wife was having an affair with their personal trainer and friend Martin Huot. Huot’s girlfriend, Patricia Giroux, is the one who notified Turcotte of the affair and also provided proof by showing emails between Huot and Gaston. This angered Turcotte, and he felt betrayed. Although he didn't cancel the trip, Turcotte and Gaston decided to separate. Two days after coming home from their trip, Turcotte left the family residence. Gaston and the children stayed in the house, and both parents agreed to share custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Montgomery 2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Sue|title=Turcotte says he felt betrayed; 'I lost my wife'; Killer describes six-year marriage|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/867000788|accessdate=March 2, 2014|newspaper=The Gazette|date=May 11, 2011 |location=Montreal, Quebec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cour d'appel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=R. c.

During the separation, conversations between Turcotte and Gaston were often spiteful. On February 8, 2009, Turcotte found out that &quot;the children had been to the Carnaval de Québec with their mother and Huot. The Carnaval reportedly had special meaning to him since he had lived in Quebec City for many years.&quot; Turcotte testified that &quot;[a] hammer to the head would have hurt less… I could not accept that Martin spent time with my children...as if I was being replaced&quot;. The next day, a former neighbour told Turcotte that the day he left, Huot had spent the night with his family and had been staying there almost every night for the previous two weeks. Turcotte said during his testimony that the information &quot;made him flip&quot;.
On February 10, 2009, he went to his family's residence to fetch his son's sweater and found Huot in the kitchen. Turcotte said, &quot;You stole my wife. You betrayed me, you were my friend&quot; and punched Huot in the face before leaving the house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cour d'appel&quot; /&gt;

On February 20, 2009, Turcotte drove by his old house, and Gaston ordered him to leave, telling him, &quot;you are going to stop controlling my life...now, if I want to, I can change the children's names... I can get custody, I can move anywhere in Quebec&quot;. Turcotte was terrified of losing his children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cour d'appel&quot; /&gt; That day, while he was at work, colleagues noted &quot;no outward signs&quot; of distress.&lt;ref name=Anonymous /&gt; He had exchanged emails with Gaston and also picked up his children from daycare and school. He telephoned Gaston, who told him that she had changed the locks on the house and had consulted a lawyer. He was deeply hurt and took this as an &quot;attack&quot;. He replied that if she wanted war, she was going to get it. That night, Turcotte felt dejected and began to cry. After putting the children to bed, he read dated emails from Gaston which further hurt and disheartened him. He wanted to end his life and searched the Internet for techniques to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cour d'appel&quot; /&gt;

== The murders ==
&quot;On the morning of February 21, 2009, two police officers followed up on a call placed to 911 after the respondent had expressed suicidal thoughts to his mother. When they entered the respondent's home, the officers discovered the inert bodies of two children, a boy and a girl.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cour d'appel&quot; /&gt; &quot;Turcotte was under his bed, covered in vomit and blood. He told police he'd drunk windshield wiper fluid and wanted to die&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Montomery 3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Sue|title=Doctor on trial for slaying children feared losing them; Separation 'tore me apart,' he tells court |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/866459918|accessdate=March 3, 2014 |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his testimony Turcotte recalled disordered scenes of the event:
&quot;He is standing in his son's room. He has a knife in his hands and stabs his son. His son cries out &quot;no&quot; and moves away. He realizes that he is hurting him. He panics and [translation] 'stabs him more'. He has a similar memory with respect to his daughter.
He sees himself in the bathroom. He drinks windshield washer fluid. He has blood on his hands. He has hurt his children and looks for the knife to [translation] 'stab himself in the heart', but cannot find it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cour d'appel&quot; /&gt;

==First trial==
Turcotte portrayed himself and Gaston as professionals dealing with the stress of raising children and dealing with life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Montomery 3&quot; /&gt;
He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of his two children. The trial began on April 12, 2011, and on July 5, the jury rendered a verdict of [[Mental disorder defence|not criminally responsible due to mental disorder]] (adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressive moods).&lt;ref name=&quot;Superior court&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=FoundGuilty1/&gt; The prosecution successfully appealed the verdict on grounds that the trial judge (the Honourable Mr. Justice Marc David, of the Superior Court, District of Terrebonne) had erred in law, mainly with respect to the issue of self-induced methanol intoxication in conjunction with a mental disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cour d'appel&quot; /&gt;

==Psychiatric treatment and second trial==
In 2012, Turcotte said that he was better than he was before the brutal stabbings in February 2009; he felt less shame, less guilt, had more self-esteem, and was ready to be released.
Testifying before a mental health review board to determine whether to keep Turcotte another year at the [[Philippe Pinel Institute|Pinel Psychiatric Institute]] or release him to the care of his family, Turcotte said he was not a danger to anyone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sue Montgomery 4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Sue|title=Turcotte is 'a changed man,' ready for release, review board told|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/916124984 |accessdate=March 4, 2014 |newspaper=The Gazette|date=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Turcotte's lawyer, Pierre Poupart, announced in 2014 that he wanted to go to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in an attempt to challenge the appeals court ruling.{{clarify|date=July 2015|reason=What appeals court ruling? Was the appeal by the prosecution successful? What did the appeals court say, and when did it say it?}} [[Quebec Superior Court]] Justice Marc David, who presided over the first trial, postponed the date-setting until April 4, 2014 and said any new trial would not take place before March 2015.
After spending 46&amp;nbsp;months in psychiatric care before being deemed fit for release from a mental institution, Turcotte remained behind bars awaiting trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierre Saint-Arnaud&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Saint-Arnaud|first=Pierre|title=Guy Turcotte, Quebec Doctor Who Killed Kids, May Take Case To Supreme Court|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/01/10/guy-turcotte-doctor-killed-kids_n_4576037.html|accessdate=March 4, 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=Jan 10, 2014|agency=The Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2014, he was released on a $100,000 bail, and a new trial was scheduled for September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Family angered as former Quebec doctor who killed kids granted bail|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/family-angered-as-former-quebec-doctor-who-killed-kids-granted-bail-1.2003998|accessdate=September 12, 2014|newspaper=CTV News|date=Sep 12, 2014|agency=The Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Turcotte was found guilty of second-degree murder of his two children.&lt;ref name=FoundGuilty1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/guy-turcotte-trial-verdict-1.3330322|title=Guy Turcotte found guilty of 2nd-degree murder in deaths of his 2 children|language=English|date=December 6, 2015|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday, January 15, 2016, he was sentenced to life in prison, with 17 years before he can be eligible for parole.

==Movie==
In 2014, Canadian director [[Chloe Bellande]] released a seventeen-minute short-film entitled ''Will of Fortune'', which was inspired by the murder trials of Turcotte and a woman, [[Susan Wright (murderer)|Susan Wright]], who had stabbed her husband nearly 200 times and buried his body in their back yard in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Texas. The film premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvrs.ca/actualites/des-paysages-et-realisateurs-longueuillois-a-cannes |title=Des paysages et réalisateurs longueuillois…. à Cannes! |language=French |date=May 22, 2014 |publisher=TVRS |author=Gabrielle Lauzier-Hudon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Guy of Gisbourne''' (also spelled '''Gisburne''', '''Gisborne''', '''Gysborne''', or '''Gisborn''') is a character from the [[Robin Hood]] legends of [[English folklore]]. He first appears in &quot;Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne&quot; ([[Child Ballads|Child Ballad]] 118),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Douglas|editor=Stephen Thomas Knight|title=Robin Hood: An Anthology of Scholarship and Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69bYyY9xiKYC|year=1999|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=9780859915250|page=21|chapter=The Robin Hood Poems}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he is a hired killer who attempts to kill Robin Hood but is killed by him. In later depictions, he has become a romantic rival to Robin Hood for [[Maid Marian]]'s love.

==Textual background==
The Child ballad &quot;Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne&quot; dates from 1650 but is much older than that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dPtpkU1WSbcC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2003|publisher=Cornell UP|isbn=9780801438851 | page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; judging from the similarities with the 1475 play, a fragment of which is preserved in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=queer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Robert L. A.|last2=Sponsler |first2=Claire |year=1997|title=Queer Play: The Cultural Work of Crossdressing in Medieval Drama|journal=[[New Literary History]]|volume=28|issue=2|pages=319–44|jstor=20057418 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1997.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the Child ballad==
Robin Hood and [[Little John]] walk through the forest. Robin speaks of a bad dream he had, of two men attacking him. While talking, they spot a distant stranger leaning on a tree. Little John tells Robin to wait while he approaches the stranger, but Robin objects as if accused of cowardice, telling John he'd like to break his head. John marches off in a huff, and is promptly captured by the Sheriff of Nottingham and tied to a tree, to be hanged. Meanwhile, Robin goes up to the stranger, Guy of Gisborne, who is clad in a horsehide robe.

Guy's outfit is described thus:

:''A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,''
:  ''Of manye a man the bane;''
:''And he was clad in his capull-hyde''	             [capull-hyde = horse-hide]
:  ''Topp and tayll and mayne''
:      [''...'']
:''‘I dwell by dale and downe,’ quoth hee,''
:  ''‘And Robin to take I’me sworne;''
:''And when I am callèd by my right name''
:  ''I am Guy of good Gisborne.’''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holt|first=J. C.|title=Robin Hood|year=1982|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=0-500-27541-6 | pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guy is a hired killer seeking Robin Hood. They have a shooting contest, and Robin wins with ease. Robin identifies himself (as &quot;Robin Hood of [[Barnsdale]]&quot;, in [[South Yorkshire]]) to the suspicious Guy, and the two fight.  When Robin trips, Guy stabs him, but (after a brief prayer to Mary) Robin kills him with his sword. He dons the distinctive horsehide, cuts off Guy's head, sticks it on the tip of his bow and slashes the face, rendering it unrecognisable. He then blows Guy's horn to signal victory to the Sheriff.  Disguised as Guy, and carrying what he passes off as Robin Hood's head, Robin goes to rescue Little John. He convinces the sheriff to be allowed to kill Little John, but instead cuts him loose with an &quot;Irish knife&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sgian-dubh]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irisharchaeology.ie/2013/03/the-waterford-knife/|title=The Waterford Knife - Irish Archaeology|author=|date=|work=irisharchaeology.ie|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20051028201029/http://www.knives.com/ireland_iron_age.html|title=Iron Age Ireland|first=|last=Daithi|date=|work=archive.org|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wulflund.com/weapons/knives/scian-skean-irish-dirk-dagger.html/|title=SCIAN - Skean, Irish dirk - dagger|first=Drakkaria &amp;|last=Wuflund|date=|work=wulflund.com|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilton|first=R.

==Guy of Gisbourne in popular culture==
Although he has made many appearances in 19th and 20th century variants of the Robin Hood legends, Guy's only constant is villainy, but a frequently occurring theme is the &quot;love triangle story&quot; involving Robin, Marian, and Guy, a theme adopted from 19th-century theatrical adaptations.&lt;ref name=knight153&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dPtpkU1WSbcC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2003|publisher=Cornell UP|isbn=9780801438851 | page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction===
In [[Howard Pyle]]'s influential novel the ''[[Merry Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (published in 1883), he is shown as a crude, coarse outlaw, known for his cruelty and murderous habits.&lt;ref name=knight153/&gt;

In [[Simon Hawke]]'s 1984 novel ''The Ivanhoe Gambit'', Sir Guy is the Sheriff of Nottingham and married to Marian, who runs off to join the Merry Men after three failed attempts to murder him.

In [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s 2006 novel ''Hood'' ([[King Raven Trilogy]]), Sir Guy, a knight-soldier, is the chief henchman of Abbott Hugo de Rainault.

In [[J Tullos Henning]]'s 2014 &quot;The Wode&quot; series, Guy, born Gamelyn, was a childhood friend and eventual lover to Rob before becoming a Templar and returning as Guy de Gisbourne.

===Film===
In the 1912 version of ''[[Robin Hood (1912 film)|Robin Hood]]'', he is determined to marry Marian and captures Robin Hood; he ties him to a tree, but by the end of the movie the roles are reversed.&lt;ref name=knight153/&gt;

In the [[Douglas Fairbanks]]-dominated silent movie ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' and the highly rated 1938 [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', he is a nobleman, played by [[Paul Dickey]] and [[Basil Rathbone]], respectively. In these two versions, Guy is Prince John's chief supporter, and a far more prominent and dangerous man than the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]. Prince John proposes Guy to [[Maid Marian]] as a prospective husband. Henceforth, Guy often appears as a bitter rival to Robin for [[Maid Marian]]'s affections.&lt;ref&gt;Allen W. Wright, [http://www.boldoutlaw.com/robbeg/robbeg4.html#gg &quot;A Beginner's Guide to Robin Hood&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1938 film, Robin engages Guy in a duel to the death, one of the most famous sword fights in cinema history, whilst in the 1922 film, Robin takes him on without a sword and kills him with his bare hands.

The role of Guy of Gisbourne has also been interpreted on film by [[Tom Baker]] (''[[The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', 1984), and [[Michael Wincott]] (in the movie ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'') where he is said to be the Sheriff's cousin.

In the 2010 movie [[Robin Hood (2010 film)|''Robin Hood'']] directed by [[Ridley Scott]], actor [[Mark Strong]] mentions in promotional interviews that his character, Sir Godfrey, is based upon Guy of Gisbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a135178/strong-joins-ridley-scotts-nottingham.html|title=Strong joins Ridley Scott's 'Nottingham'|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|date=10 November 2008|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Gisbourne has been portrayed by [[Robert Addie]] (in the British [[television series]] ''[[Robin of Sherwood]]'', 1984-6) and, in the [[Robin Hood (1991 TV film)|1991 TV movie]], [[Jürgen Prochnow]] plays &quot;Sir Miles Folcanet,&quot; a character with much in common with modern versions of Guy.

He was portrayed by [[Clive Revill]] in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode ''Qpid'' in its fourth season. [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] sends the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS Enterprise]] to a Robin Hood scenario of his creation where they must save the life of [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard's]] occasional paramour, [[List of Star Trek characters (T-Z)#Vash|Vash]], who must either marry Sir Guy or be executed.

In the 1990s [[CBBC]] comedy show ''[[Maid Marian and her Merry Men]]'', Guy—played by [[Ramsay Gilderdale]]—is the nephew of King John, and is portrayed in the series as an overgrown [[mother's boy]]. He is foolish to the point of being delusional, believing himself to have a friend from outer space named &quot;Plop Bop&quot;. He dresses occasionally as a [[The Nutcracker|sugar-plum fairy]] or more usually as a court [[jester]], and is generally held in contempt by the heroes and villains alike.

In the BBC's 2006 [[Robin Hood (2006 TV series)|''Robin Hood'']], Guy of Gisborne is the third main character in series 1 and 2, and the second main character in series 3. He is portrayed much more seriously by [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]], and is the Sheriff of Nottingham's second-in-command. He is originally depicted as a dark character, and is shown as an active enforcer of the Sheriff's cruelty, but at the same time, he is in love with [[Maid Marian|Marian]], showing conflicted attempts to redeem himself in her eyes.

'''Gwendolyn Graham''' (born August 6, 1963) and '''Cathy Wood''' (born March 7, 1962) are [[United States|American]] [[serial killers]] convicted of killing five elderly women in [[Walker, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], in the 1980s. They committed their crimes in the Alpine Manor [[nursing home]], where they both worked as [[Unlicensed assistive personnel|nurse's aides]].

==Crimes==
The two women met at the Alpine Manor nursing home shortly after Graham had moved to Michigan from [[Texas]]. They quickly became friends, and then lovers, in 1986. Two years later they both were facing murder charges for allegedly smothering five elderly patients as part of a &quot;love bond&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-11/news/mn-356_1_lesbian-lover|title=Nation :  Lesbian Sentenced in Murders|last=services|first=From Times wire|date=1989-10-11|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of the murders came almost entirely from accounts to criminal justice authorities by Wood, whose murder charges were reduced by a plea agreement so she could testify against Graham in Graham's trial for first-degree murder. However, Wood's accounts and her self-portrayal as Graham's pawn were later brought into serious question by award-winning journalist [[Lowell Cauffiel]] in his 1992 true crime book, ''Forever and Five Days''.

According to Wood's account, in January 1987, Graham entered the room of a woman who had [[Alzheimer's disease]] and smothered her with a wash cloth as Wood acted as her lookout. The woman was too incapacitated to fight back, and thus became the pair's first victim. The woman's death appeared to be natural, so an [[autopsy]] wasn't performed. Wood claimed Graham murdered the patient to &quot;relieve her tension.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Each felt that the secret of the murder would prevent the other partner from leaving, thus cementing their bond.

Over the next few months, Graham murdered four more Alpine Manor patients, Wood alleged. Many of the victims, whose ages ranged from 65 to 97, were incapacitated and suffered from Alzheimer's disease. Wood testified that the couple turned the selection of victims into a game, first trying to choose their victims by their initials to spell M-U-R-D-E. &lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;q=Graham#v=snippet&amp;q=Graham&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|last=Newton|first=Michael|date=2006-02-01|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816069873|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; But when that became difficult, they began counting each murder as a &quot;day,&quot; as in the phrase, &quot;I will love you for forever and a day.&quot; A poem by Wood to Graham, and introduced in the trial, concluded, &quot;You'll be mine forever and five days.&quot; Wood also testified that Graham took souvenirs from the victims, keeping them to relive the deaths. However, no such souvenirs were ever discovered by police. Wood also portrayed Graham as being sexually, physically and emotionally dominant in their relationship.

The couple eventually broke up when Graham began dating another female nursing aide who also worked at Alpine Manor. Graham then moved to Texas with the woman and began work in a hospital taking care of infants.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The murder investigation began in 1988 after Wood’s ex-husband, whom she had told about the murders, went to the police.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Detectives for the Walker Police Department extensively questioned Cathy Wood in a series of interviews. She incrementally leaked out her version of the homicides, portraying Graham as the mastermind and hands-on killer. The investigation led to the exhumation of two nursing home victims who had not been cremated. But when medical examination failed to reveal physical evidence of homicide, not entirely unusual in a smothering case, the county medical examiner nevertheless ruled the deaths homicides, basing it on the interviews Wood had given to the police. Warrants were issued for the arrest of Wood and Graham. On December 4-5, 1988, Graham and Wood were arrested and charged with two murders. Wood was apprehended in Walker; Graham in [[Tyler, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/06/us/2-held-in-deaths-at-nursing-home.html|title=2 HELD IN DEATHS AT NURSING HOME|last=Times|first=Ap, Special To The New York|date=1988-12-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Wood [[Plea bargain|plea-bargained]] her way to a reduced [[Sentence (law)|sentence]], claiming that it was Graham who planned and carried out the killings while she served as a lookout or distracted supervisors. Graham maintained her innocence, testifying that the alleged murders were part of an elaborate &quot;mind game&quot; by Wood. Despite the lack of physical evidence, the jury ultimately was swayed by the testimony of Graham's new girlfriend, who revealed that Graham had confessed to five killings.

On November 3, 1989, Graham was found guilty of five counts of murder and one count of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder, and the court gave her five [[life sentence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdocweb.state.mi.us/OTIS2/otis2profile.aspx?mdocNumber=206096 |title=Michigan Offender Tracking Information System |publisher=Mdocweb.state.mi.us |date=2012-11-03 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham is housed in the [[Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility]] in [[Pittsfield Charter Township, Michigan]].

Wood was charged with one count of second-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. She was sentenced to 20 years on each count and has been eligible for parole since March 2, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdocweb.state.mi.us/OTIS2/otis2profile.aspx?mdocNumber=204315 |title=Michigan Offender Tracking Information System |publisher=Mdocweb.state.mi.us |date=2012-11-21 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood is currently incarcerated in the minimum security [[Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee]] in [[Florida]]; she is expected to be released on June 6, 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=CATHERINE&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Wood&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=F&amp;Age=49&amp;x=77&amp;y=17 |title=Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator |publisher=Bop.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as [[Lowell Cauffiel]] documents in his nonfiction book, friends, coworkers, family members and others who knew Graham and Wood told an entirely different story than the one Wood spun as the key witness in Graham's trial. They described Wood as both a coercive and seductive [[pathological liar]] who delighted in wreaking havoc in the lives of others. ''Forever and Five Days'' presents evidence that Wood planned the first murder after she found Graham with another woman. She involved Graham as an insurance policy to keep her from ever leaving her. When Graham left her anyway after the series of alleged killings, Wood was willing to put herself in legal jeopardy by disclosing to police to exact her revenge. The book portrays Wood as a [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] criminal mastermind who manipulated the prosecutor and the jury to punish Graham. Psychological testing also revealed Graham could be easily manipulated, suffered from [[borderline personality disorder]] and lacked the sophistication to plan the series of killings, let alone adequately defend herself in her trial.

Wood, the book also reveals, later told inmates two other versions of events: The first, that she had made the entire story up to put Graham away for life for leaving her for another woman.The second, that she had done all the killing, but framed Graham, also for revenge.

Several of the families sued the owners of Alpine Manor for hiring &quot;dangerous and unbalanced employees&quot;.  Alpine Manor has since gone out of business, but the building now houses a nursing home called &quot;Sanctuary at Saint Mary's&quot;.

== Media ==
The case was the basis of the 1992 [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] novel ''Forever and Five Days'' by [[Lowell Cauffiel]].

Graham and Wood were featured in two episodes of the TV series ''The Serial Killers'' in which they were interviewed about their relationship and crimes. They were also featured on an episode of ''[[Snapped: Killer Couples]]''.

The television series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' tells a highly fictionalized version of their story in its sixth season, ''[[American Horror Story: Roanoke|Roanoke]]''. The duo are depicted as sisters Miranda and Bridget Jane.

''' Giuseppe Colombano &quot;Gyp&quot; Rosetti''' is a character in ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', portrayed by [[Bobby Cannavale]]. Rosetti is a [[New York City]] gangster who works for [[Joe Masseria]] (Ivo Nandi). Hot-headed and easily offended, he is the primary antagonist of season three.

==Fictional biography==
Rosetti was born in [[Sperlinga]], a small Italian commune in [[Sicily]]. He grew up in poverty, living in a hut carved into a cave. His father was a brick layer who died when he was 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;thepony&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Pony|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep8|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=November 4, 2012|season=3|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetti eventually emigrated to the United States and began working for Italian mob boss Joe Masseria. He runs brothels, [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] and illegal gambling dens in southern [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Resolution&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Resolution|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep1|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=September 16, 2012|season=3|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in an apartment with his wife, two daughters and mother-in-law. Although Rosetti regularly kills people over slight insults, he does not retaliate when his wife and mother-in-law openly mock him.&lt;ref name=&quot;sundaybest&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Sunday Best|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep7|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=October 28, 2012|season=3|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also depicted as having [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] sexual tastes; he has one of his lovers choke him with a belt while he masturbates,&lt;ref name=&quot;youdbesurprised&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=You'd Be Surprised|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep5|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=October 14, 2012|season=3|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has another insult him as a form of foreplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;margatesands&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Margate Sands|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep12|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=December 2, 2012|season=3|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Season 3===
In the first scene of season three, Rosetti beats a mechanic to death with a tire iron for making an off-handed comment about Rosetti not knowing what [[3-In-One Oil]] is. He travels to [[Atlantic City]] on New Year's Eve (December 31, 1922) in order to purchase a large quantity of bootlegged liquor from Nucky. In order to simplify his operations and keep the law at bay, Nucky decides to sell alcohol exclusively to [[Arnold Rothstein]] ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]). Rosetti, anticipating a 50% price markup if he were to purchase from Rothstein, curses Nucky and leaves for New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resolution&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He then takes over the small town of Tabor Heights and blockades Nucky's shipment heading to Rothstein in New York. Since Tabor Heights sits on the only road suitable for winter travel between Atlantic City and New York and is the last spot to fill up on gas on the way, Nucky has no way to deliver his alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Spaghetti and Coffee|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep2|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=September 23, 2012|season=3|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nucky eventually makes a truce with Rosetti, selling him alcohol, and Rosetti leaves Tabor Heights. However, Rosetti changes his mind when he perceives Nucky's departing words, &quot;Bone For Tuna&quot; &amp;mdash; a mispronunciation of &quot;buona fortuna&quot;, [[Italian language|Italian]] for &quot;good luck&quot; &amp;mdash; as an insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Bone for Tuna|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep3|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=September 30, 2012|season=3|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This escalates to Rosetti's men ambushing a convoy and killing 11 of Nucky's men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Blue Bell Boy|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep4|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=October 7, 2012|season=3|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein responds by sending [[Bugsy Siegel|Benjamin Siegel]] ([[Michael Zegen]]) to kill Rosetti. Although Siegel fails to kill Rosetti, he does kill four of Rosetti's men and a waitress Rosetti had been having sex with, which causes Rosetti to leave Tabor Heights and return to New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;youdbesurprised&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On Easter Sunday, Rosetti's second-in-command Tonino Sandrelli (Chris Caldovino) informs him of all the territory they lost in New York because of their long absence. After dinner, Rosetti goes to church, where he chastises God for the life he was given. He then beats up a priest and steals the church donations. Masseria is upset with Rosetti's long absence and gives the order to kill him. Rosetti tells Masseria that his own losses are nothing compared to all that Masseria can lose from Nucky and Rothstein partnering together. Rosetti is able to convince Masseria to spare his life and provide him with additional men to kill both Nucky and Rothstein and take over Atlantic City.&lt;ref name=&quot;sundaybest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosetti is able to start his own illegal alcohol import business and take over the rackets of Atlantic City. He makes a move to kill Nucky, Rothstein and [[Lucky Luciano|Charlie Luciano]] ([[Vincent Piazza]]); he bombs Nucky's favorite [[supper club]], but all three men survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;thepony&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A gang war soon erupts between Nucky and Rosetti, killing dozens of men on both sides, including Nucky's top enforcer Owen Sleater ([[Charlie Cox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=A Man, A Plan...|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep10|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=November 18, 2012|season=3|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetti and his men then take up residence in Gillian Darmody's ([[Gretchen Mol]]) brothel, planning to eventually take it over.&lt;ref name=&quot;twoimposters&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Two Imposters|episodelink=Boardwalk Empire (season 3)#ep11|series=Boardwalk Empire|serieslink=Boardwalk Empire|network=HBO|airdate=November 25, 2012|season=3|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetti's men soon come after Nucky himself, but he escapes and seeks protection from Northside leader Chalky White ([[Michael K. Williams]]). Rosetti tries to persuade White to surrender Nucky, but White denies knowing his whereabouts. White agrees to support Nucky and is able to fight back against Rosetti with [[Al Capone]]'s ([[Stephen Graham (actor)|Stephen Graham]]) support.&lt;ref name=&quot;twoimposters&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

That night, Rosetti is about to have sex with Gillian, who tries to inject him with [[heroin]] so she can render him helpless and kill him. He realizes what she is doing just in time, however, and overpowers her, injecting her during the struggle. Moments later, Masseria's men head back to New York; Nucky and Rothstein had struck a deal with Masseria to withdraw his support from Rosetti. However, men working for White's and Capone's gangs ambush and kill Masseria's men as they leave town. [[Richard Harrow]] ([[Jack Huston]]) shows up at the brothel to rescue Gillian's grandson Tommy, and kills most of Rosetti's men in the process. Rosetti and two of his men escape Harrow's attempt, but Rosetti's luck runs out when, while stopped at a beach, Tonino stabs Rosetti in the back, then again in the chest, killing him. Tonino then takes Rosetti's body back to New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;margatesands&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gypsy Hill killings''' are a group of five unsolved [[homicide]]s of young women and girls in [[San Mateo County, California]], during early 1976. The killer became known in the media as &quot;the San Mateo slasher.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1976 Nevada murder linked to California serial killer|url=http://wireupdate.com/1976-nevada-murder-linked-to-california-serial-killer.html|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=WireUpdate|date=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killings==

On January 8, 1976, the body of 18-year-old Veronica Cascio was discovered in a creek on the grounds of the Sharp Park Golf Course in [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]]. She had been stabbed 30 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Slain in Pacifica, San Mateo|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=[[San Mateo Times]]|date=January 9, 1976|url=http://newspaperarchive.com/us/california/san-mateo/san-mateo-times/1976/01-09/|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transient was arrested but was released for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man Freed In Slaying|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=San Mateo Times|date=January 16, 1976|url=http://newspaperarchive.com/us/california/san-mateo/san-mateo-times/1976/01-16/|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks later, 14-year-old Tatiana Blackwell was reported missing after leaving her home in Pacifica to run an errand. A body, later identified as hers, was discovered off Sharp Park Road in the Gypsy Hills section of the city on June 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Youths Find Body In Pacifica Hills|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=San Mateo Times|date=June 7, 1976|url=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had also been stabbed multiple times.

Mitchell, 19, was last seen alive in [[Reno, Nevada]], on February 24, 1976, when her [[Volkswagen Beetle]] broke down at the intersection of 9th Street and Evans Avenue. Witnesses reported seeing someone help push her vehicle into the parking lot across from the [[University of Nevada, Reno|UNR]] agricultural building on Evans Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ivie|first=Erin|title=Gypsy Hill victims exhibited 'startling' similarities|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county-times/ci_25291485/gypsy-hill-victims-exhibited-startling-similarities|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=Mercury News|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her body was discovered that evening in a garage on East 9th Street with her hands bound and her throat slashed. Three years later, Cathy Woods, a mental patient at the [[Louisiana State University Medical Center]], confessed to murdering a woman named Michelle.

Friedman, 21, an employee of an import firm, was found assaulted and stabbed to death with an 8-inch-knife in her apartment at 116 Fairmount Street in [[San Francisco]]. She was murdered on March 17, 1976, only two days after Gypsy Hill victim Carol Lee Booth was reported missing.

Friedman's nude body was lying on the kitchen floor of her ransacked apartment. She was found by a co-worker who became concerned when Friedman did not show up for work.&lt;ref name=&quot;SF76&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Dave|title=Murders still haunt him because he has no proof|work=San Mateo Times|date=May 8, 1986|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and arrest==
Investigators connected some of the homicides to each other. All of the slain women were young brunettes, and most had experienced car trouble prior to being murdered. All of the bodies were found in [[Woodland|wooded areas]].

A lack of witnesses and forensic evidence stalled the investigations.

In March 2014, the FBI established a task force to re-examine the murders, after new [[DNA profiling|DNA]] evidence cast doubt on the conviction of Cathy Woods, now 64,&lt;ref name=RGJ/&gt; for Mitchell's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI launches task force for &quot;Gypsy Hill Murders&quot;|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/6/fbi-launches-task-force-for-gypsy-hill-murders/|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=Washington Times|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA taken from a cigarette butt found at the Mitchell crime scene matched DNA taken from semen found at related crime scenes in San Mateo, California. This DNA was that of a man and therefore might exonerate Woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2748457/Judge-orders-new-trial-1976-Reno-killing.html|title=Cathy Woods, found guilty of 1976 murder, gets new trial with new DNA links|work=Mail Online|accessdate=12 September 2014|author= Ashley Collman|date=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moye|first=David|title=Crime Scene DNA No Match For Woman Convicted Of 1976 Murder|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/07/cathy-woods_n_4922104.html|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2014, the FBI named Rodney Halbower as a person of interest in the Gypsy Hill murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county-times/ci_26493681/peninsula-person-interest-named-gypsy-hill-cold-case|title=Gypsy Hill murders: Person of interest named in killings of Peninsula women|author= Erin Ivie|date=8 September 2014|work=Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods was released from prison on September 11 pending a new trial to take place on July 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/woman-released-1976-reno-murder-case-220949893.html|title=Woman released in 1976 Reno murder case|date=11 September 2014|work=Yahoo News|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{eastern name order|Vajna Gábor}}
'''Gábor Vajna''' (4 November 1891 &amp;ndash; 12 March 1946) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] politician, who served as [[List of Interior Ministers of Hungary|Minister of the Interior]] from 1944 to 1945.

==Early life==
Vajna was born into a Transylvanian Calvinist family in [[Kézdivásárhely]] (today [[Târgu Secuiesc]], [[Romania]]), then part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] on 4 November 1891. He participated in [[World War I]] as an officer in the 29th Feldjäger Battalion of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and has received many honors during his forty-three months of military service. Following the war, Vajna took service in the Hungarian Embassy at [[Vienna]], and later worked for the Ministry of Defence. He retired from the [[Royal Hungarian Army]] as a Major in 1924. After that he was appointed director of the gunpowder factory in [[Balatonfűzfő]]. When his far-right sympathy is revealed, Vajna was dismissed from that position.

==Political career==
[[File:Arrow Cross Party.jpg|left|thumb|Ministers of the [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Arrow Cross Party government]]. Gábor Vajna is in the third from left of the upper row.]]

Vajna was a confidant of Prime Minister [[Ferenc Szálasi]], the Hungarian fascist party leader and founder of the extreme right &quot;[[Party of National Will]]&quot;, which later became the [[Arrow Cross Party]]. Vajna was elected Member of Parliament from the regional list of [[Veszprém County (former)|Veszprém County]] during the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1939|1939 parliamentary election]]. After the [[Operation Margarethe|German occupation of Hungary]] in March 1944, he maintained a good relationship between the Hungarian authorities and the arriving [[Gestapo]] and [[Schutzstaffel]] officials. He helped to overcoming the resistance fighters and prevent sabotage activities. Following the [[Operation Panzerfaust|Arrow Cross Party's coup]], Vajna took office as Interior Minister in October 1944 and served until March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Bölöny, József – Hubai, László: ''Magyarország kormányai 1848–2004'' [Cabinets of Hungary 1848–2004], Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2004 (5th edition). p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

While responsible for internal affairs, Vajna took a number of actions against Hungarian Jews. In cooperation with requests from German officials such as SS officer [[Edmund Veesenmayer]], Vajna moved quickly to deport Jews in areas under Hungarian control to the [[Third Reich]], where they were used as slaves and many were ultimately killed. As many as 76,000 Jews were delivered into Nazi hands through the end of 1944.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} During his ministership, the [[Budapest Ghetto]] was established on 29 November 1944 which lasted for less than three months.&lt;ref&gt;Decree On the Establishment of the Budapest Ghetto at the [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/budapestghetto.html Jewish Virtual Library].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Siege of Budapest|fall of Budapest]], Vajna attempted to escape to [[Western Europe]] but was captured by units of the [[United States Army]] along with other members of the government. He was later tried in Budapest by a so-called people's tribunal and sentenced to death for war crimes, crimes against humanity and treason. He was hanged in 1946 in Budapest on the same day as Ferenc Szálasi, [[Károly Beregfy]] and [[József Gera]].

[[File:Nuremberg Trials retouched.jpg|thumb|right|[[Göring]] (first row, far left) at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]]]
In the [[Nuremberg Trials]] there was a document referred to as the '''&quot;Green Folder&quot;''' of ''Reichsmarschall'' [[Hermann Göring]]. This was the master policy directive for the economic exploitation of the conquered Soviet Union. The implications of this document were the death by starvation of millions of Slavic people, something that partially came to pass in the [[Holocaust]], the neglect of Soviet soldiers captured by the Nazis which led to huge mortality rates, and the general expropriation of food in the occupied areas of the Soviet Union. It is also referred to as Document of the Soviet Prosecution, Exhibit USSR 10.

==Background==
The philosophy espoused by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' argues for
the expansion of the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] into eastern lands held by [[Slavic peoples|the Slavs]], referring
to these lands as ''[[Lebensraum]]''.

==Plan Oldenburg==
Plan &quot;Oldenburg&quot; (Göring's &quot;Green Folder&quot;) was the code-name of the economic subsection of the planned attack of the USSR.

Following the approval of Hitler of the [[Operation Barbarossa]] plan, the Führer instructed ''Reichsmarschall'' Göring to develop a plan for the future exploitation of conquered territory in the East. Under Göring's leadership, a plan known as '''Oldenburg''' was created to include the seizing for the service of the Reich all stocks of raw materials and large industrial enterprises in the territory between the [[Vistula]] and the [[Urals]]. According to this plan the most valuable manufacturing equipment was to be sent to the Reich and that which was not sent to Germany would be destroyed. The European part of the Soviet Union would be economically decentralized and be turned into an agricultural appendage of Germany.

The original plan was approved at a secret meeting on March 1, 1941 (protocol 1317-PS).
Over the next two months the plan was fleshed out in detail and finally adopted on April 29, 1941 (protocol secret meeting 1157-PS). A headquarters was formed to coordinate the &quot;Oldenburg&quot; plan.

According to the plan, the territory to be occupied in the Soviet Union would be divided into five economic Inspectorates, three of them attached to [[Army Group North]] ([[Leningrad]]), [[Army Group Center]] ([[Moscow]]), and [[Army Group South]] ([[Kiev]]), one for the [[Caucasus]] ([[Baku]]), and one held in reserve, with 23 economic commandants, as well as 12 offices.

On May 8, 1941 the &quot;Common instructions to all Reich commissioners in the occupied eastern territories&quot; was adopted, based on this plan (documents 1029-PS, 1030-PS).

==Hunger Plan==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J02034, Herbert Backe.jpg|thumb|[[Herbert Backe]]]]
A separate committee was formed to organize the collection of food in the occupied territories, as per [[Herbert Backe]]'s [[Hunger Plan]]. It was tasked with ensuring that by 1942, the German armed forces would be fully nourished by the resources of the USSR, without taking into account the needs of the Soviet population.

In accordance with the order of the Supreme Command Chief of Staff of the Wehrmacht [[Wilhelm Keitel]] (dated June 16, 1941), the main economic challenge for the territories seized from the Soviet Union, was described as &quot;an immediate and full exploitation of the occupied areas in favor of the war economy of Germany, particularly in the areas of food and oil&quot;.

''Reichsmarschall'' Göring, directly supervising the &quot;Oldenburg&quot; headquarters, wrote:

:In the East, I intend to loot and pillage effectively. All that may be suitable for the Germans in the East, should be extracted and brought to Germany immediately.

Shortly after the beginning of the German campaign against the Soviet Union, on July 15, 1941, he wrote in his &quot;Green Folder&quot;:

:Use of the occupied territories should be made primarily in the food and oil sectors of economy. Get to Germany as much food and oil as possible - that is the main economic goal of the campaign.

Initially, the German military leadership believed that during the war, it would not be necessary to rebuild the Soviet Union's industry or to use its natural wealth, and that a policy of seizing only finished products and raw materials in warehouses would be sufficient.

Subsequently they made an accounting of industry and mines to ensure their safety and to establish civil administration of captured territories.

When the expected rapid end of the war did not materialize and Germany had suffered great losses in manpower, equipment and weapons, the existing stocks began to be depleted quickly. The German leadership urgently started to develop a plan for the economic use of the occupied territories, during the war itself. Thus German leadership had to abandon the implementation of the plan '''Oldenburg''', recognizing its unsuitability.

After the war ended, the activities of '''Staff Oldenburg''' were the subject of consideration and condemnation at the Nuremberg Tribunal.

'''Günter Hermann Ewen''' (1962 &amp;ndash; May 18, 1999) was a German mass murderer who killed four people and wounded at least nine others in [[Dillingen, Saarland|Dillingen]], [[Germany]] on May 16, 1999, before escaping to [[Sierck-les-Bains]], [[France]], where he killed another person, and wounded two more. Hunted by German and French police, he eventually committed suicide in a hotel in [[Strassen, Luxembourg]] on May 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/345529.stm Manhunt for border killer], ''[[BBC]]'' (May 17, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/347118.stm Cross-border murder suspect found dead], ''[[BBC]]'' (May 18, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/briton-among-the-dead-as-disco-gunman-kills-five-1094204.html Briton among the dead as disco gunman kills five], ''[[The Independent]]'' (May 17, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101282113-la-chasse-a-l-assassin-fait-trembler-la-moselle-tueur-de-cinq-personnes-ce-week-end-il-court-toujours La chasse à l'assassin fait trembler la Moselle], ''[[Libération]]'' (May 18, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ewen was born in Dillingen in 1962, being the youngest and only boy among five siblings, and suffered from [[asthma]] from childhood. He showed little interest at school, had to repeat two grades and left [[Hauptschule]] after grade seven,&lt;ref name=SZ1805Ganove&gt;Der verdächtige Ewen wurde vom kleinen Ganoven zum Schwerverbrecher, ''[[Saarbrücker Zeitung]]'' (May 18, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon he started an apprenticeship as a paver, which he quit after two years due to his ailment. Up to the age of 30 he lived with his parents and mostly worked odd jobs to earn money.

According to conflicting reports Ewen began to consume alcohol excessively either at the age of twelve&lt;ref&gt;Vom Voyeur zum Serien-Mörder, ''[[Saarbrücker Zeitung]]'' (May 22, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; or eighteen, animated by one of his sisters' boyfriends, whom he admired for his rather wasteful lifestyle. As a youth he was arrested for theft, fraud,&lt;ref name=SZ1805Ganove/&gt; and battery, and starting in 1982 he was caught numerous times while driving under the influence of alcohol, which resulted in a three-month prison term when he was 26. Since 1990 he was arrested for acts of voyeurism and exhibitionism, and in February 1991 he was fined after masturbating in front of women at a tennis club. Six months later Ewen, in drunk condition, twice broke into a home for mentally disabled women and sexually molested them in their beds. One hour after the second such incident he raped a woman in her home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/verbrechen-tag-der-abrechnung_aid_176962.html Tag der Abrechnung], ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' (21/1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1993 Ewen was convicted for rape and sexual assault in three cases, and sentenced to a prison term of five years and six months. A psychologist found him to be a [[narcissist]], who, in his infantile egocentrism, ruthlessly tried to satisfy his own needs, especially when under the influence of alcohol. In prison he was in therapy concerning his sex offences and was eventually released in October 1996, after serving two third of his sentence.

Out of prison Ewen started his own business, but in August 1998 he was accused by his friend Robert Fisne of six counts of burglary, whereupon he was again arrested. He remained in [[Remand (detention)|remand]] until January 1999, when he was acquitted, since no incriminating evidence could be found and the testimony of Fisne, the only witness in the case, was vague and contradictory. Even though he left prison cleared of these accusations, the arrest turned out to be devastating to Ewen's personal life, as during this time his business went bankrupt, he lost his home, his girlfriend left him and he had accumulated [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]&amp;nbsp;60,000 in debt, while the DM&amp;nbsp;3,000 granted as compensation for his wrongful imprisonment were barely enough to pay his attorney.

Ewen eventually found shelter at the home of his sister and brother-in-law in [[Beckingen]] where he lived up to the day of the shooting and helped renovating the building.&lt;ref name=SZ1805Jagd&gt;Fieberhafte Jagd nach dem Dillinger Mörder, ''[[Saarbrücker Zeitung]]'' (May 18, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Der beschte Bua', ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' (May 27, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Günther Altenburg''' (5 June 1894 in [[Königsberg]] – 23 October 1984 in [[Bonn]]) was a German diplomat.

His first diplomatic assignments took him to postings at [[Rome]], [[Vienna]] and [[Bucharest]], and he remained involved with [[southeastern Europe]] throughout his career. In 1934, he was serving in Vienna during the failed [[July Putsch]], and probably involved in its preparation. Thereafter he was recalled to Berlin, where he worked in the section dealing with [[Austria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]].

He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1935, and was given a position in the secretariat of Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]. After the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, he was initially slated to become plenipotentiary for [[Serbia]], but on 28 April 1941 he was named [[Reich]] plenipotentiary for [[Greece]]. As the highest-ranking German civil official in [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied Greece]], he functioned as the overseer of the [[Hellenic State (1941–1944)|Greek puppet government]] along with his Italian counterpart [[Pellegrino Ghigi]], and was directly involved in the deportation of the Jewish population of [[Thessaloniki]] in spring 1943. He was removed from his post on 3 November 1943, after the [[Italian capitulation]] and the complete occupation of Greece by the Germans, which led to a complete restructuring of the German administration under the new [[Military Governor]] of Greece, [[Alexander Löhr]].

After the war, he testified at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], and served as the secretary general of the ''Deutsche Gruppe der Internationalen Handelskammer'' (&quot;German Group of the [[International Chamber of Commerce]]&quot;) industrial lobby.

'''Günther Herrmann''' (1908−2004) was a functionary in the [[SS]] of [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] and a convicted criminal. He commanded the ''Sonderkommando 4b'' and the ''Einsatzkommando 12'' of the ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe C]]'' in the occupied Soviet Union and the ''Einsatzgruppe E'' in Croatia. In 1973, Herrmann was convicted for the murders committed in 1941–42 in the occupied Soviet Union and was sentenced to seven years in prison. 

==SS career==
Herrmann studied [[jurisprudence]] and [[political science]] at the [[Göttingen University]]. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933 and the [[SS]] in 1935. In February 1935, Herrmann was appointed deputy chief of [[Gestapo]] in [[Kiel]]; between 1936 and 1939 he was head of the Gestapo in [[Kassel]]. Upon the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] and the establishment of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] in 1939, Herrmann was appointed as head of the Gestapo in [[Brno]].{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=226}}

In June 1941, Herrmann was appointed to the command of ''Sonderkommando 4b'' of ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe C]]'', which was attached to [[Army Group South]] of the [[Wehrmacht]] and operated in northern and central Ukraine. Herrmann's command arrived in Lemberg on 30 June 1941, where it cooperated with the Ukrainian militia. In Tarnopol, in cooperation with Hermann's unit, Ukrainian nationalists instigated pogroms against the local Jewish population. By the time Herrmann's unit left Tarnopol on 11 July, a total of 11, 127 people had been executed and 600 had been murdered in the pogroms.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=64}} 

In mid-Agust 1941, Herrmann attended the meeting of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leadership at Zhitomir where they received the &quot;strict order&quot; that from then on Jewish women and children were also to be killed. On this occasion, Herrmann was chastised for his slow pace of killings. According to the post-war testimony of his subordinate, [[Lothar Fendler]], Herrmann complained that the higher ups &quot;judged the effectiveness of a commando according to the number of persons the commando has executed&quot;.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=124–125}} 

''Sonderkommando 4b'' continued on to Proskurov, Vinnytsa, Kirovohrad and reached Kremenchuk and Poltava in September. According to a report of 25 September 1941, Herrmann's commando had murdered 13 Soviet officials and 290 Jews. On 1 October 1941, Herrmann was succeeded by {{illm|Fritz Braune|de|Fritz Braune}}. According to the post-war testimony of Braune, Herrmann was warmly sent off by General [[Hermann Hoth]], commander of the [[3rd Panzer Army|3rd Panzer Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray Brandon, {{illm|Wendy Lower|de|Wendy Lower}} (eds.): [https://books.google.com/books?id=hyYGOyX1IQUC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=%22G%C3%BCnther+Herrmann%22+Sonderkommando&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim95qC_6zRAhUH0SYKHXHnBpIQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Herrmann&amp;f=false ''The Shoah in Ukraine: History, Testimony, Memorialization'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1942, Herrmann was appointed as commander of ''Einsatzkommando 12'' of ''Einsatzgruppe D''. This commando operated in the area of Pripyat marshes in 1943. From 1943 to 1944 Herrmann led ''Einsatzgruppe E'' in Croatia.{{sfn|Museum of Tolerance}}

==Trial and conviction==
Herrmann was arrested in 1962, but was released on bail. On 12 January 1973 he was convicted for his responsibility for the murder of Jews, Soviet state officials, members of the resistance and the mentally disabled as committed by the ''Sonderkommando 4b'' in Ukraine in 1941–42.  Herrmann was given a prison sentence of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www1.jur.uva.nl/junsv/brd/files/brd784.htm |title=Massenvernichtungsverbrechen durch Einsatzgruppen |date=27 November 2013 |website=University of Amsterdam |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LRaS9Wco |archivedate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Günther Tamaschke''' (26 February 1896, [[Berlin]] – 14 October 1959, [[Uhingen]]) was a German SS-''[[Standartenführer]]'' and commandant of the [[Lichtenburg concentration camp|Lichtenburg]] and [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]] concentration camps.

==Early life==
Günther Tamaschke was born the son of a [[merchant]]. Tamaschke passed his ''[[:de:Notabitur|Notabitur]]'', a wartime emergency high school diploma that allowed one to graduate early provided that he then serve in the military. He then volunteered for the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] in 1914.  From 1914, he was employed in various units during the [[First World War]] and came under French captivity during the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916.  Tamaschke returned to [[Berlin]] in March 1920 and took part in the [[Kapp Putsch]].  After that, he joined the ''[[Freikorps]]''.  After three semesters, he left the [[:de:Handelshochschule Berlin|Handelshochschule Berlin]] and completed his training as a [[banker]].  Tamaschke married and became a partner at his [[father-in-law]]'s wholesale store in late 1922.  Politically, Tamaschke committed himself to the [[German Völkisch Freedom Party]] and was the founder of the Berlin branch of the party's Officers Bund.  Tamaschke broke up his household in 1930, and quit working in his father-in-law's business at the end of 1932.  After a period of unemployment, Tamaschke found a job in the district office in [[Berlin-Neukölln]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuchel392&quot;&gt;Johannes Tuchel: ''Konzentrationslager: Organisationsgeschichte und Funktion der Inspektion der Konzentrationslager 1934–1938.'' 1991, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

==SS career==
He joined the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi Party member number 36,978) in 1926, and the [[SS]] (member number 851); he was one of the first members of the Berlin SS in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuchel392&quot; /&gt; Tamaschke rose to the rank of SS-''[[Standartenführer]]'' by mid-September 1935.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Through the actions of [[Kurt Daluege]], Tamaschke was made ''[[Schutzhaftlagerführer]]'' in the [[Dachau concentration camp]] and remained in this position until the beginning of 1935. Under [[Theodor Eicke]], the [[Inspector of Concentration Camps]], Tamaschke rose to become head of the [[Politische Abteilung]] in the Concentration Camps Inspectorate (CCI). Through Eicke, with whom he had a special relationship of trust, Tamaschke was employed as the director (''Lagerdirektor'') of the newly established women's camp (''Frauenkonzentrationslager'') [[Lichtenburg concentration camp|Lichtenburg]] starting on 1 December 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orth134f&quot;&gt;Karin Orth: ''Die Konzentrationslager-SS.'' Munich 2004, p. 134f.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as December 1938, he was involved in establishing [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]], a concentration camp for women and children, and stayed on the construction site at [[Fürstenberg/Havel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuchel392&quot; /&gt; After the dissolution of the Lichtenburg concentration camp, Tamaschke moved with his staff to the newly built [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|concentration camp at Ravensbrück]], where he retained his position as ''Lagerdirektor'', in May 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schäfer169f&quot; /&gt;

By August 1939 Tamaschke was relieved of his duties as director of Ravensbrück concentration camp and released in early September 1939 from the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schäfer169f&quot;&gt;Silke Schäfer: ''Zum Selbstverständnis von Frauen im Konzentrationslager. Das Lager Ravensbrück.'' Berlin 2002, p. 169f.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason was Tamaschke's private life. Tamaschke, who was married and had at least one child, began an affair with an ''[[Aufseherin]]'' (female guard). Since the affair had become public, and Tamaschke's wife had complained to [[Heinrich Himmler's personal staff]], and given the fact that Tamaschke paid her no sustenance, Tamaschke lost the trust of Eicke, and he was removed from his post.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orth134f&quot; /&gt; His marriage ended in divorce by 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schäfer169f&quot; /&gt; In September 1939, he moved to the Land Office near [[Prague]]. At the start of January 1942, Tamaschke was dismissed from the SS at [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]'s instigation, because as a trustee in the private sector, Tamaschke had been enriching himself with Jewish assets gained from [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]. Himmler processed this dismissal in March 1944, retroactively effective as of January 1942, as the allegations against Tamaschke proved to be untenable according to Himmler's findings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuchel392&quot; /&gt; Tamaschke had been reprimanded for attempting to buy the Jewish-owned Czech company Nalus and Mansfeld, something which Himmler described in his official reprimand as Tamaschke taking &quot;advantage of your position as an SS officer in order to lay your hands on a commercial enterprise you could not gain possession of in any other way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Segev]], ''Soldiers of Evil'', Berkley Books, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Tamaschke served in the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Schäfer169f&quot; /&gt; and was still on the staff of the ''[[SS-Oberabschnitt Böhmen-Mähren]]'' in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuchel392&quot; /&gt;

==Post-war==
After the war's end, Tamaschke last resided in [[Uhingen]], where he died on 14 October 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klee617&quot;&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich.'' Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tamaschke's first marriage would end in divorce, although Tamaschke's decision to stop alimony payments led to his being disciplined by the SS as any such scandal was seen as bringing dishonour on the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Segev, ''Soldiers of Evil'', Berkley Books, 1991, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently remarried, his second wife being Emmy Hirschberg, an office clerk from [[Sudetenland]]. The marriage had initially been delayed when an investigation uncovered that Hirschberg's grandfather had committed suicide and that two of her uncles were involvement in left-wing politics. Eventually, the marriage was allowed to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Segev, ''Soldiers of Evil'', Berkley Books, 1991, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;
